ORG 3 About Living Donation What is living kidney donation? Living donation is when a living person donates an organ (or part of an organ) to another person. A healthy person who has two kidneys can donate one to someone in need. A living donor may donate to someone they know, like a family member, friend, or spouse, or a stranger who theyve never met. A potential donor is someone who is thinking about donating. A recipient is someone with kidney failure who needs a kidney transplant. Who can be a living kidney donor? To donate a kidney, the person must be in good physical and mental health. Living donors must be at least 18 years old to donate at a transplant center in the United States. Some centers require a donor to be 21 or even a little older. There are some medical conditions that could prevent someone from being a living donor, including having uncontrolled high blood pressure or cancer. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION KIDNEY.
