    "PAIN MEDICINES AND YOUR KIDNEYS What You Need to Know www. kidney. org National Kidney Foundations Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Did you know that the National Kidney Foundations Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) offers guidelines and commentaries that help your doctor and healthcare team make important decisions about your medical treatment? The information in this booklet is based on those recommended guidelines. Stages of Kidney Disease There are 5 stages of kidney disease. They are shown in the table below. Your doctor determines your stage of kidney disease, based on the presence of kidney damage and your glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is a measure of your level of kidney function. Your treatment is based on your stage of kidney disease. Speak to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your stage of kidney disease or your treatment. STAGES OF KIDNEY DISEASE Stage Description Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) Kidney damage (e. g. , protein 1 90 or above in the urine) with normal GFR Kidney damage with mild 2 60 to 89 decrease in GFR Mild to moderate decrease 3a 45 to 59 in GFR Moderate to severe decrease 3b 30 to 44 in GFR 4 Severe reduction in GFR 15 to 29 5 Kidney failure Less than 15 Your GFR number tells your healthcare provider how much kidney function you have. As chronic kidney disease progresses, your GFR number decreases. 2 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION TABLE OF CONTENTS What are analgesics? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 Are pain medicines safe? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 What are NSAIDs? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 Are NSAIDs safe to take? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 What is acetaminophen? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 Is acetaminophen safe to take? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 Is aspirin safe for regular use? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 What can I do to keep my kidneys healthy if I need medicine for pain? . . . . . . . . . 9 What if I have more questions? . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11 WWW.

    ". . . . . . . . . . . . . 11 WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 3 Many people take pain medicines to help them treat pain resulting from illness or injury. They are the most often used medicine in the United States. However, pain medicines can have different effects on the kidneys, depending on the type of medicine, how it is used, and how well your kidneys are working. This educational brochure will help answer some questions you might have about pain medicines and your kidneys. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION What are analgesics? Pain medicines are also called analgesics. They are used to help relieve pain, but can also sometimes be used to help lower fever or inflammation (redness and swelling from an injury or illness), depending on the type of pain medicine. These benefits are important, especially for those who need them, including people with arthritis, headaches, muscle aches, colds, toothaches, menstrual cramps, and sinus infection. Examples of pain medicines that are available over-thecounter (OTC) include aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium. OTC means they are available without a prescription, but if you have kidney disease, you should still speak to your healthcare provider about any medicines before you take them. Some of these medicines also come in higher strength, or dose, with a prescription. OTC pain medicines are usually available as a pill, either on its own or combined with other medicines, such as certain cold and cough medicines. Some pain medicines are also available in a topical form, meaning they are applied on the skin as a cream, gel, or patch. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 5 Are pain medicines safe? Pain medicines can help relieve pain and are generally safe when taken as directed. However, as with any medicine, they can have side effects and you should use them as directed on their labels. If you do not use pain medicines as directed, they may cause problems with your stomach, liver, or kidneys, depending on the type, dose, and duration of pain medicine used. The harm to your kidneys can be sudden, and result in acute kidney injury (AKI). In some cases, if you stop the pain medicine you may reverse short-term harm to your kidneys, meaning kidney function may recover. Continued overuse or misuse of certain pain medicines can also lead to a slow loss of kidney function over time, or chronic kidney disease (CKD). What are NSAIDs? The term NSAID stands for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. NSAIDs are a group of pain relievers. Some NSAIDs are available OTC, including ibuprofen (for example, Advil, Motrin), naproxen sodium (for example, Aleve), and aspirin (for example, Bayer). Generic versions (no brand name) of these brands are also available. People use NSAIDs to reduce fever and relieve pain. Prescription NSAIDs can be used to reduce inflammation caused by many medical problems or injuries. Are NSAIDs safe to take? OTC NSAIDs are generally safe for occasional use when taken as directed."
