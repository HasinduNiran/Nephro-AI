ORG 3 Introduction Most people enjoy eating out. This guide gives ideas for making your dining experience fun. Start by asking your kidney dietitian for any tips or advice. If you have sodium, potassium, phosphorus, protein, or fluid restrictions, this booklet will help you make good decisions. Your specific dietary needs will depend on your level of kidney function and other health conditions. PLAN AHEAD If you will be eating out for dinner, plan breakfast and lunch at home accordingly. Cut back on serving sizes and foods high in sodium and potassium during the day. Moderation is key. Call ahead to learn more 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION about the menu and how the food is prepared. Many restaurants now have websites where they list their menus. Many apps also provide nutrition information. Choose a restaurant where it will be easiest to select foods best suited for you. Restaurants where food is made to order are the best choice. Restaurant staff are used to special food requests or methods of preparation. However, some may require that you call at least 24 hours in advance to make arrangements. MAKING YOUR SELECTIONS Look over the menu carefully. Ask your server for more details about anything you do not understand. Practice making requests about the way your food is prepared or served.",
    "Yams and sweet potato pie are high in potassium. Best meal choices might include fried chicken (with skin removed), corn, string beans or okra, wilted lettuce, corn bread, butter, and banana cake, apple cake or peach cobbler for dessert. Enjoy, and dont forget your phosphate binders. 24 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Fast Foods: Eating at fast-food restaurants is not totally out of the question. It does, however, take some thought and planning. While many fast-food items are pre-salted, there may be some items that are prepared without salt. You can also avoid high-sodium condiments, such as BBQ or soy sauce, and limit others, such as catsup, to one package. Many fast-food restaurants provide nutrition information, so you can check the sodium and potassium content. Your dietitian can also provide this information and tell you the specific amounts of sodium and potassium allowed in your diet. FAST FOODS Better Choices Poor Choices Regular or junior-size Large, superor king-size hamburgers hamburgers or cheeseburgers Roast beef or turkey sandwiches Sandwiches with bacon, sauces or cheese Grilled or broiled chicken Fried or breaded chicken sandwiches, tuna or chicken sandwiches, chicken nuggets salad or strips Unsalted onion rings French fries, Tater Tots, potato chips, baked potatoes, potato salad, baked beans Lettuce salads, coleslaw, High-potassium foods from macaroni salad, fresh tomato the salad bar or pickles slice Non-cola soda, lemonade, tea Milk shakes and cola sodas and coffee, water KIDNEY.
