    "STAGE 5 Kidney Transplant What you need to know Stages of chronic kidney disease There are 5 stages of kidney disease as shown in the table below. Your healthcare provider will tell you the stage of kidney disease, based on how well your kidneys are working and your estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The eGFR number comes from a lab test that measures the amount of blood your kidneys are filtering each minute. As CKD gets worse, the eGFR number goes down.

ORG 3 About Kidney Transplantation When your kidneys fail, treatment is needed to replace the work your own kidneys can no longer do. There are two types of treatment for kidney failure dialysis and kidney transplantation. This brochure can help you decide if a kidney transplant is the best choice for you. What is a kidney transplant? When you get a kidney transplant, a healthy kidney is placed inside your body to do the work your own kidneys can no longer do. Many people feel that a kidney transplant offers more freedom and a better quality of life than dialysis. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION On the plus side, there are fewer limits on what you can eat and drink, but you should follow a hearthealthy diet. Your health and energy should improve.",
    "Many people feel that a kidney transplant offers more freedom and a better quality of life than dialysis. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION On the plus side, there are fewer limits on what you can eat and drink, but you should follow a hearthealthy diet. Your health and energy should improve. In fact, a successful kidney transplant may allow you to live the kind of life you were living before you got kidney disease. Studies show that people with kidney transplants live longer than those who remain on dialysis. On the minus side, there are the risks of surgery. You will also need to take anti-rejection medicines for as long as your new kidney is working, which can have side effects. You will have a higher risk for infections and certain types of cancer. Although most transplants are successful and last for many years, how long they last can vary from one person to the next. Many people will need more than one kidney transplant during their lifetime. What is a preemptive or early transplant? Getting a transplant before you need to start dialysis is called a preemptive transplant. It allows you to avoid dialysis altogether. Getting a transplant not long after kidneys fail (but with some time on dialysis) is referred to as an early transplant. Both have benefits. Some research shows that a preemptive or early transplant, with little or no time spent on dialysis, can lead to better long-term health. It may also allow you to keep working, save time and money, and have a better quality of life. KIDNEY. ORG 5 Who can get a kidney transplant? Kidney patients of all agesfrom children to seniors can get a transplant. You must be healthy enough to have the operation. You must also be free from cancer and infection. Every person being considered for transplant will get a full medical and psychosocial evaluation to make sure they are a good candidate for transplant. The evaluation helps find any problems, so they can be corrected before transplant. For most people, getting a transplant can be a good treatment choice. What if Im older or have other health problems? In many cases, people who are older or have other health conditions like diabetes can still have successful kidney transplants. Careful evaluation is needed to understand and deal with any special risks. You may be asked to do some things that can lessen certain risks and improve the chances of a successful transplant. For example, you may be asked to lose weight or quit smoking. If you have diabetes, you may also be able to have a pancreas transplant. Ask your healthcare professional about getting a pancreas transplant along with a kidney transplant. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How will I pay for a transplant? Medicare covers about 80% of the costs associated with an evaluation, transplant operation, follow-up care, and anti-rejection medicines. Private insurers and state programs may cover some costs as well.",
    "The donated kidney is placed into your lower abdomen (belly), where its easiest to connect it to your important blood vessels and bladder. Putting the new kidney in your abdomen also makes it easier to take care of any problems that might come up. The operation takes about four hours. Youll be sore at first, but you should be out of bed in a day or so, and home within a week. If the kidney came from a living donor, it should start to work very quickly. A 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION kidney from a deceased donor can take longer to start workingtwo to four weeks or more. If that happens, you may need dialysis until the kidney begins to work. After surgery, youll be taught about the medicines youll have to take and their side effects. Youll also learn about diet. If youve been on dialysis, youll find that there are fewer restrictions on what you can eat and drink, which is one of the benefits of a transplant. What are anti-rejection medicines? Normally, your body fights off anything that isnt part of itself, like germs and viruses. This system of protection is called your immune system. To stop your body from attacking or rejecting the donated kidney, you will have to take medicines to keep your immune system less active (called anti-rejection medicines or immunosuppressive medicines). Youll need to take them as long as your new kidney is working. Without them, your immune system would see the donated kidney as foreign, and would attack and destroy it. Anti-rejection medicines can have some side effects. It is important to talk to your healthcare provider about them, so that you know what to expect. Fortunately, for most people, side effects are usually manageable. Changing the dose or type of medicine can often ease some of the side effects. KIDNEY. ORG 11 Besides the immunosuppressive medicines, you will take other medicines as well. You will take medicines to protect you from infection, too. Most people find taking medicines a small trade for the freedom and quality of life that a successful transplant can provide. Important Reminder You must not take any medicine or nutritional supplement that is not approved by your transplant team because of the risk of interaction with your anti-rejection medicines. 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION After Your Transplant What happens after I go home? Once you are home from the hospital, the most important work beginsthe follow-up. For your transplant to be successful, you will have regular checkups, especially during the first year. At first, you may need blood tests several times a week. After that, youll need fewer checkups, but enough to make sure that your kidney is working well and that you have the right amount of anti-rejection medication in your body. What if my body tries to reject the new kidney?",
    "Certain medications that can harm a developing baby must be stopped six weeks before trying to get pregnant. Birth control counseling may be helpful. Its important to protect yourself against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Be sure to use protection during sexual activity. Will I need to follow a special diet? In general, transplant recipients should eat a hearthealthy diet (low fat, low salt) and drink plenty of fluids. If you have diabetes or other health problems, you may still have some dietary restrictions. A dietitian can help you plan meals that are right for you. KIDNEY. ORG 15 About Organ Donation Where do donated kidneys come from? A donated kidney may come from someone who died and donated a healthy kidney. A person who has died and donated a kidney is called a deceased donor. Donated kidneys also can come from a living donor. This person may be a blood relative (like a brother or sister) or non-blood relative (like a husband or wife). They can also come from a friend or even a stranger. When a kidney is donated by a living person, the operations are done on the same day and can be scheduled at a convenient time for both the patient and the donor. A healthy person who donates a kidney can live a normal life with the one kidney that is left. But the operation is major surgery for the donor, as well as the recipient. As in any operation, there are some risks that you will need to consider. 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Is it better to get a kidney from a living donor? Kidneys from living or deceased donors both work well, but getting a kidney from a living donor can work faster and be better. A kidney from a living donor may last longer than one from a deceased donor. To get a deceased donor kidney, you will be placed on a waiting list once you have been cleared for a transplant. It can take many years for a donor kidney to be offered to you. From the time you go on the list until a kidney is found, you may have to be on some form of dialysis. While youre waiting, youll need regular blood tests to make sure you are ready when a kidney is found. If youre on dialysis, your center will make the arrangements for these tests. Your transplant center should know how to reach you at all times. Once a kidney become available, the surgery must be done as soon as possible. KIDNEY. ORG 17 Are there disadvantages to living donation? A disadvantage of living donation is that a healthy person must undergo surgery to remove a healthy kidney. The donor will need some recovery time before returning to work and other activities. However, recent advances in surgery (often called minimally invasive or laparoroscopic surgery) allow for very small incisions. This means shorter hospital stays and recovery time, less pain, and a quicker return to usual activities.",
    "The donor will need some recovery time before returning to work and other activities. However, recent advances in surgery (often called minimally invasive or laparoroscopic surgery) allow for very small incisions. This means shorter hospital stays and recovery time, less pain, and a quicker return to usual activities. Living donors often experience positive feelings about their courageous gift. What are the financial costs to the living donor? The surgery and evaluation is covered by Medicare or the recipients insurance. The living donor will not pay for anything related to the surgery. However, neither Medicare nor insurance covers time off from work, travel expenses, lodging, or other incidentals. The National Living Donor Assistance Program (livingdonorassistance. org) or other programs may help cover travel and lodging costs. Donors may be eligible for sick leave, state disability, and benefits under the federal Family Medical Leave Act. In addition, federal employees, some state employees, and certain other workers may be eligible for 30 days paid leave. 18 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Finding a Living Donor How do I ask someone to consider donating a kidney to me? Asking someone to donate a kidney to you can feel scary and overwhelming. You may be asking yourself, Where do I start? How do I ask? Here are some suggestions to help make it easier for you. LEARN ALL YOU CAN. The first step is to learn as much as you can about living kidney donation and transplant. This will help you explain it to your friends and family. You may want to let people know that theres no cure for kidney disease and tell them about your options for treating your condition. KIDNEY. ORG 19 Sharing as many facts as you can, along with your thoughts about your condition and treatment options, is one way to open a conversation. A friend or family member might be willing to help you talk to others about your needsdont be afraid to ask! This may relieve some pressure of having to ask people directly. Discussing your need for a kidney in everyday conversation helps get the word outand makes people more comfortable asking you questions about your health. Go to kidney. org/livingdonation RAISE AWARENESSSHARE YOUR STORY! Sharing your story is very important. You should speak from the heart, and tell people as much as you can about kidney disease. If you are on dialysis, you could include details about what a typical week is like for you on dialysis, the complications caused by kidney disease, and why a transplant is a better longterm option for you. Remember, no one will offer to help unless they understand the need. As you share your story and describe what its like to live with kidney disease, try to be open and honest about your situation and your feelings. In sharing your story, you might be fortunate enough to get offers from people who are willing to be tested as a match.",
    "Asking for help can be daunting to some, but you can start by telling your story. This opens the lines of communication. Many people in your circle may not know about your condition or that being a living kidney donor is even an option. By starting a dialogue and educating those around you, you may find that many people will ask how they can help. Ask your family and friends to spread the word. Its important to keep your options open as you never know when a potential donor is going to walk through the door! 24 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How do I write a letter or email to my friends and family? One way to spread the word is to share your story by letter or email. Here are some tips for writing to your friends, family, or community: Make it personal; tell your story (what is treatment like, how do you feel). Use information on kidney. org to include facts on kidney disease, living donation, and transplant. Invite people to learn more and provide contact details. Ask your transplant center if they want their contact number posted in your letters. They may have a special line, or prefer that people call you first. KIDNEY. ORG 25 SAMPLE LETTER Dear Friends, Some of you may know that I have kidney disease. Over time, my kidney disease has gotten worse, causing my kidneys not to work well enough to keep me alive. This is what I am facing now, and my treatment options are limited to dialysis treatments or a kidney transplant. Getting regular dialysis treatments, usually three times a week for four hours at a time, will help my kidneys do their job and keep me alive, but a transplant would offer me more freedom and the ability to live a longer, healthier, more normal life. A transplant would also give me more time to do the fun things I enjoy most, like spending time with my family and friends. However, finding a kidney for a transplant is not easy. Just ask the 130, 000 people on the waiting list for a deceased donor kidney like me. Time is not on our side. Some wait for years; many die while waiting. The 26 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION average wait time is five years or more for a kidney from a deceased donor. However, there is another option: receiving a kidney from a living donor. Asking a family member or a friend to consider donating a kidney to me is difficult, but it greatly improves my chances of getting a transplant. A living kidney donation typically lasts longer and has better function. You might not know a lot about living donationI know I didnt before kidney disease affected my life. Understandably, some people are afraid about the surgery and what living with one kidney will mean for them. Heres some basic information about kidney donation: You only need one kidney to live a healthy, long life."
