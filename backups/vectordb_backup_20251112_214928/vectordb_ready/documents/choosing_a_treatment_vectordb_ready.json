ORG 9 Figure 1: Paired Exchange Hemodialysis What is hemodialysis? Hemodialysis is a treatment that removes wastes and extra fluid from your blood. During hemodialysis, your blood is pumped through soft tubes to a dialysis machine where it goes through a special filter called a dialyzer (also called an artificial kidney). As your blood is filtered, it is returned to your bloodstream. Only a small amount of blood is out of your body at any time. In order to be connected to the dialysis machine, you need to have an access, or entrance, to your bloodstream. (See, What is a hemodialysis access? ) Treatments are usually done 3 times a week. Each treatment lasts about 3 to 5 hours. In paired exchange, an incompatible donor/ recipient pair (such as a mother and son that dont have compatible blood types) are matched with another incompatible donor/recipient pair for a swap. Each donor gives a kidney to the other persons intended recipient. However, if you do not have a living donor, you will need to be on a waiting list until a kidney from a suitably matched deceased donor becomes available. In the meantime, you can have dialysis treatments. 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION KIDNEY. ORG 11 Where can I have hemodialysis treatment? Are there different types of home hemodialysis?
