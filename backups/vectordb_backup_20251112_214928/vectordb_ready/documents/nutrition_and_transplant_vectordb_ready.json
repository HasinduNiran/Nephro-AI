    "STAGE 5 Nutrition and Transplant Stages of chronic kidney disease There are 5 stages of kidney disease as shown in the table below. Your healthcare provider will tell you the stage of kidney disease, based on how well your kidneys are working and your estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The eGFR number comes from a lab test that measures the amount of blood your kidneys are filtering each minute. As CKD gets worse, the eGFR number goes down.

ORG 3 Introduction If you have recently had an organ transplant, you are probably wondering if your diet will be different from the one you followed before your transplant. This brochure describes diet changes you may need to make in order to feel your best. You can get additional help in planning your diet from your doctor and a registered dietitian nutritionist. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Do I need to be on a special diet? Yes. After an organ transplant, your diet still plays a big role. If you were on dialysis and had a kidney transplant, you may find that this diet is easier to follow than the one you were on for your dialysis. KIDNEY. ORG 5 What about my cholesterol and triglyceride levels? Fat (cholesterol or triglyceride) levels in your blood may be high. High levels of cholesterol and triglyceride can cause heart disease. The following steps can lower the fat and cholesterol in your blood: Lose weight if you are over a desirable weight level. Limit alcoholic beverages. Limit egg yolks to three or four a week. Limit all types of fats and oils. Use lean meats, poultry or fish. Use nonfat dairy products. Use salad dressing sparingly, or use fat-free salad dressing. Avoid frying foods. Avoid shortening, butter or stick margarine. Use only small amounts of oils, tub margarine or regular mayonnaise. Avoid those that describe the first ingredient as hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated. Replace high-fat desserts like ice cream, pie, cake or cookies with fruit or other nonfat desserts. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Tip A healthy diet plan such as the Mediterranean diet may help control your blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.",
    "Some foods high in potassium are: oranges bananas avocados tomato sauce potatoes (white or sweet) milk and yogurt salt substitutes KIDNEY. ORG 11 Are calcium and phosphorus a problem? You may need to pay close attention to your calcium and phosphorus levels. If you have been ill for a period of time, your body probably lacks the balance of calcium and phosphorus needed for healthy bones, especially if you had kidney disease. Whether you have received a heart, liver, lung or kidney transplant, you are at risk for bone loss. In the months after your transplant, your doctor will check for possible bone loss and talk to you about the best way to keep your bones as healthy as possible. In the meantime, every adult needs about two servings a day from the dairy group (milk, cheese and yogurt). Unless your doctor or dietitian has told you not to use these foods, try to include them in your meals. Your doctor may decide you need more calcium and phosphorus than this allows and may have you take a supplement. Do not start any supplements on your own, however, as this could affect your transplant. 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Will any of my medicines affect my diet? Yes. Your diet will be affected by the use of necessary medicines given to prevent rejection of your transplant. List your transplant medicines here and talk to your doctor and dietitian about how they may affect your diet. Anti-rejection medicines may change the way your body works in the following ways: STEROIDS (PREDNISONE) The most common effects of taking steroids are increases in your: appetite, causing unwanted weight gain level of blood fats like cholesterol or triglyceride blood sugar levels sodium (salt) and fluid retention breakdown of muscle and bone These effects are greater when steroid dosages are high. KIDNEY. ORG 13 What are common side effects? The most common possible effects of other important transplant medicines are increases in your: level of blood fats like cholesterol or triglyceride blood sugar levels blood pressure Changes in potassium, magnesium and phosphorus levels are also common. These levels may return to normal as the doctor carefully lowers the amount of medicine you need to prevent rejection of your transplant. 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Will I gain weight? Many people have a better appetite after they get a transplant, and they gain unwanted weight. Weigh yourself often. Avoid high-calorie foods, such as fatty foods, sweets, pastries and other foods rich in fat or sugar. You can help control your calories by eating: raw vegetables and fruits lean meat, skinned poultry and fish nonfat dairy products sugar-free beverages or water Controlling your weight will help to keep you from developing problems, such as heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. If you gain unwanted weight, you will need to increase your physical activity and follow a low-calorie diet. Ask your doctor to refer you to a registered dietitian nutritionist to plan low-calorie meals and snacks.",
    "If you gain unwanted weight, you will need to increase your physical activity and follow a low-calorie diet. Ask your doctor to refer you to a registered dietitian nutritionist to plan low-calorie meals and snacks. It is very important that you establish an exercise and activity plan. In addition to controlling your weight, regular physical activity helps to: strengthen your heart muscle give you better form and appearance improve your endurance keep your bones healthy Make sure you set up an exercise program with your doctors advice and get started with it as soon as you are permitted. KIDNEY. ORG 15 What if I have diabetes? After a transplant, your new diet may be higher in protein and lower in simple carbohydrates due to the effects of steroids and other medicines. Work with your doctor and a registered dietitian nutritionist to keep your diet and blood sugar in good control. Is there anything else I should know? Yes. You may be surprised or alarmed to be on a special diet for a short while after your transplant. For example, a kidney transplant may sometimes be slow in getting started, so the doctor will have you follow a kidney diet for a while. This usually is needed for only a short time. Or, you may be asked to drink a lot of water (something you were told to stay away from in the past). Your doctor and dietitian will guide you through these changes if they happen. Just remember, if your doctor tells you to change what you eat or drink, it is very important for your health and the health of your transplant that you do so. 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Where can I get more information? If you have questions, speak with your healthcare team. They know you and can answer questions about you. If you want to read more about kidney disease, the National Kidney Foundation has more than 50 other publications that cover many subjects, such as: CKD risk factors like hypertension and diabetes Complications of chronic kidney disease, such as cardiovascular disease, anemia or bone problems Nutrition for CKD patients, with information about carbohydrates, protein, sodium, phosphorus and potassium Treating kidney disease early Treating kidney failure with transplantation or dialysis. There are two ways to learn about the many free resources available to you: Call the NKF Cares Patient Help Line toll free at 855. NKF. CARES (855. 653. 2273). Visit the National Kidney Foundation website at kidney. org/store. Becoming an educated patient is very important to being healthy! KIDNEY. ORG 17 18 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Setting a standard for care The National Kidney Foundation, through its Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI), defines stages of kidney disease and offers guidelines that help your healthcare professional and healthcare team make important decisions about your medical treatment. The information in this booklet is based on those recommended guidelines."
