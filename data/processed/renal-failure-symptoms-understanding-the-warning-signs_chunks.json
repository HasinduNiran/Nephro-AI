Fatigue and weakness Understanding renal failure One of the earliest symptoms of renal failure Types of renal failure is persistent fatigue and weakness. This fatigue Acute Renal Failure (acute renal failure): Also known as is often due to a buildup of toxins in the Acute Kidney Injury (acute kidney injury), this condition bloodstream and anemia, which can occur occurs suddenly, often due to factors like severe when the kidneys fail to produce sufficient dehydration, trauma, or medication effects. erythropoietin.

Chronic renal adequacy. failure may eventually lead to End-Stage Renal Disease (end-stage renal disease), necessitating dialysis or Increased urination: Conversely, some transplantation. individuals may experience polyuria, or increased urination, particularly at night Importance of the kidneys (nocturia). This symptom is more common The kidneys perform several vital functions, in chronic renal failure, especially in the including: early stages.

Foamy urine can indicate the balance of fluids, electrolytes, and proteinuria, which is the presence of excess acids in the body. 348 J. Interven.
