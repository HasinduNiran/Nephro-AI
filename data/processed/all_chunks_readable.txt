STAGES 14 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease Stages of chronic kidney disease There are 5 stages of kidney disease as shown in the table below. Your healthcare provider will tell you the stage of kidney disease, based on how well your kidneys are working and your estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The eGFR number comes from a lab test that measures the amount of blood your kidneys are filtering each minute. As CKD gets worse, the eGFR number goes down.

ORG 3 What is diabetes? Diabetes is a serious disease. It occurs when your body does not make enough insulin or cannot use the insulin it makes. Insulin is a hormone. It controls the amount of sugar (called glucose) in your blood. A high blood sugar level can cause problems in many parts of your body. Are there different types of diabetes? Yes. There are two main types: TYPE 1 DIABETES If you have this type of diabetes, your body does not make insulin. It usually starts when you are a child or young adult, but it can occur at any age. It is treated by taking daily insulin shots or using an insulin pump and by following a special meal plan. In America, 5. 2 percent of diagnosed adult diabetes cases are type 1. TYPE 2 DIABETES If you have this type of diabetes, your body makes some insulin but cannot use it properly. Type 2 is partially preventable and is typically brought on by poor diet and lack of exercise. Very often heredity plays a part. It usually starts when you are over age 40, but it can happen earlier. It is treated with exercise, weight loss, and special meal planning. People with type 2 diabetes may need insulin, but in most cases medications given in pills (called hypoglycemics) are prescribed if diet and exercise alone do not control the disease. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes.

Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How does diabetes affect my body? When diabetes is not well controlled, the sugar level in your blood goes up. This is called hyperglycemia. High blood sugar can cause damage to many parts of your body, especially: kidneys eyes heart feet blood vessels nerves Diabetes can also cause high blood pressure and hardening of the arteries (called arteriosclerosis). These can lead to heart and blood vessel disease. KIDNEY. ORG 5 What is chronic kidney disease? Your kidneys are important because they keep the rest of your body in balance. They: Remove waste products from the body Balance the bodys fluids Help keep blood pressure under control Keep bones healthy Help make red blood cells Chronic kidney disease (CKD) means that the kidneys have been damaged. Kidneys can get damaged from a physical injury or a disease like diabetes or high blood pressure. Once your kidneys are damaged, they 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION cannot filter your blood or do other jobs as well as they should. There are five stages of kidney disease (see ). Treatment in the early stages can help keep kidney disease from getting worse. Are people with diabetes at greater risk for getting kidney disease? Yes. About a third of people with diabetes may get chronic kidney disease. Certain groups may have a higher risk of getting kidney disease than others. Your risk may be greater if you: Are age 60 or older Have high blood pressure Have a family member who has kidney failure Are overweight or obese Usually, developing kidney disease is not because of any one single reason, but due to a number of physical, environmental, and social factors. KIDNEY. ORG 7 What can people with diabetes do to prevent kidney disease? People with diabetes can take steps to avoid developing kidney disease or kidney failure. Talk to your healthcare provider about your risks for developing kidney disease. The best way to prevent developing kidney disease from diabetes is to: Control your blood sugar level Keep blood pressure under control Ask your healthcare provider to test you for kidney disease at least once each year Take medicines to help control your blood glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure if your healthcare provider orders them for you Follow your diet for diabetes Get regular exercise Avoid alcohol Do not smoke See your healthcare provider as often as you are told 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How does diabetes harm the kidneys? Diabetes can harm the kidneys by causing damage to: BLOOD VESSELS IN THE KIDNEYS The filtering units of the kidney are filled with tiny blood vessels.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Diabetes can harm the kidneys by causing damage to: BLOOD VESSELS IN THE KIDNEYS The filtering units of the kidney are filled with tiny blood vessels. Over time, high sugar levels in the blood can cause these vessels to become narrow and clogged. Without enough blood, the kidneys become damaged and albumin (a type of protein) passes through these filters and ends up in the urine where it should not be. NERVES IN YOUR BODY Diabetes can also cause damage to the nerves in your body. Nerves carry messages between your brain and all other parts of your body, including your bladder. They let your brain know when your bladder is full. But if the nerves of the bladder are damaged, you may not be able to feel when your bladder is full. The pressure from a full bladder can damage your kidneys. KIDNEY. ORG 9 URINARY TRACT If urine stays in your bladder for a long time, you may get a urinary tract infection. This is because of bacteria. Bacteria are tiny organisms, like germs, that can cause disease. They grow rapidly in urine with a high sugar level. Most often these infections affect the bladder, but they can sometimes spread to the kidneys. 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How do I know if I have kidney damage? Most people with early kidney damage do not have symptoms. The best way to find early kidney damage is to have a urine test called uACR once a year. This test checks for very small amounts of protein in the urine. It helps detect kidney damage at an early stage in people with diabetes. If your uACR is positive, your healthcare professional will want to find out how well your kidneys are working. This will help to determine the best treatment for you. Your healthcare provider will start by: CHECKING YOUR eGFR (ESTIMATED GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE) eGFR is the best way to find out how well your kidneys are working. Your healthcare provider will begin by testing your blood for a waste product called creatinine. When the kidneys are damaged, they have trouble removing creatinine from your blood. Creatinine is stored in muscle tissue and blood. The blood test for creatinine will help your healthcare professional find out how well your kidneys are working. But it is only the first step of the eGFR test. Next, your healthcare professional or lab will take the result of your creatine test and put it into a math calculation that includes your age and gender. The number that results from this calculation is called your eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate). It tells your healthcare professional how well your kidneys are working. You should have this test at least once a year. KIDNEY. ORG 11 Once your eGFR is known, your healthcare professional can tell which stage of kidney disease you have. There are five stages of kidney disease (see the chart on ). Your treatment will depend on your stage of kidney disease.

KIDNEY. ORG 11 Once your eGFR is known, your healthcare professional can tell which stage of kidney disease you have. There are five stages of kidney disease (see the chart on ). Your treatment will depend on your stage of kidney disease. ORDERING A KIDNEY BIOPSY Your healthcare professional may also order a kidney biopsy. This can help your healthcare professional find the main cause of your kidney disease. Not all kidney damage is caused by diabetes. Other diseases can be involved. If your kidney disease is caused by diabetes, it is called diabetic kidney disease. Your healthcare professional will begin treatment based on the stage of kidney disease you have and what caused it. With the right treatment, you and your healthcare professional can keep your kidneys working as long as possible. Not everyone with kidney disease gets kidney failure. With the right treatment, you can help keep kidney disease from getting worse. 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION What can be done to keep my kidneys working as long as possible? Your healthcare professional should plan your treatment with you and your family. Some patients may be asked to see a kidney doctor, called a nephrologist. A kidney dietitian may be helpful too. The following things can help your kidneys work better and last longer: CONTROLLING YOUR BLOOD SUGAR The best way to prevent or slow kidney damage is to keep your blood sugar well controlled. This is usually done with diet, exercise, and, if needed, insulin or hypoglycemic pills (to lower your blood sugar level). Your healthcare professional may also recommend that you start taking an SGLT2 inhibitor. Originally, SGLT2 inhibitors were developed as oral antidiabetic (blood sugar lowering) drugs. Later clinical trial data showed significant improvement in kidney function in people with diabetes who already had diabetic nephropathy. SGLT2 inhibitors have been found to be effective at slowing the progression of kidney disease, reducing heart failure, and lowering the risk of kidney failure and death in people with kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors also protect the kidneys in people with CKD who do not have diabetes. A test called hemoglobin A1C should be done every three to six months to check your blood sugar. Ask your healthcare professional what your test result KIDNEY. ORG 13 should be. Daily blood sugar levels should also be checked so that your medication doses can be adjusted as needed. CONTROLLING HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE High blood pressure can increase your chances of developing kidney failure. Ask your healthcare professional what your blood pressure target should be. You will probably need a medication called an ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitor or an ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker) to control your blood pressure. In many cases, more than one high blood pressure medicine may be needed to reach this target. Studies have shown that the use of these medicines can slow the loss of kidney function in people with diabeteseven if your blood pressure is normal.

In many cases, more than one high blood pressure medicine may be needed to reach this target. Studies have shown that the use of these medicines can slow the loss of kidney function in people with diabeteseven if your blood pressure is normal. They also help reduce heart disease in people with diabetes. In addition, your healthcare professional may prescribe a diuretic (water pill) to help remove salt and water from your blood. PROTECTING KIDNEY FUNCTION BY TAKING ACE INHIBITORS OR ARBS Your healthcare professional may have you take high blood pressure medicines (called ACE inhibitors or ARBs) even if your blood pressure is normal. Research suggests that these medicines can slow the loss of kidney function in people with diabeteseven those with normal blood pressure. 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION LIMITING HOW MUCH PROTEIN YOU EAT People with diabetes and kidney disease should eat enough protein for good health, but avoid overeating it. Research suggests that eating less protein can slow kidney damage. You should talk to your healthcare professional about this. If you need to go on a lowprotein diet, you must plan this with a dietitian who specializes in kidney disease. Do not go on this type of diet without talking to a dietitian so that you have a healthy approach to dietary changes. PROMPTLY REPORTING TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL ANY DIFFICULTY PASSING URINE Early treatment for urinary tract infections is important. Some signs of urinary infection could be: frequent need to urinate, burning or pain with urination, cloudy or blood-spotted urine, or a strong odor to your urine. LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF SALT IN YOUR DIET Help control high blood pressure and reduce body swelling by not eating as much salt. KIDNEY. ORG 15 NOT USING MEDICINES THAT MAY DAMAGE THE KIDNEYS NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen, can be very hard on the kidneys. CHECKING WITH YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL Before taking any herbal supplements, make sure you speak with your doctor. PREVENTING FURTHER DAMAGE TO LARGER BLOOD VESSELS (such as those in the brain and heart) By keeping cholesterol and lipid levels under control, you can prevent any further damage to large blood vessels, including those in the brain and heart. What about cholesterol and lipids? Many people with diabetes and kidney disease have high levels of lipids in the blood. Lipids are fatty substances like cholesterol. High blood lipid levels can cause the blood vessels to become clogged. This lessens the blood supply to the heart and brain, and raises your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Your healthcare professional will check your cholesterol and lipids at least once a year. If they are too high, you may need drugs called statins to help lower them. 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION What about pregnancy? Having both diabetes and kidney disease is serious. It can affect your health and the health of your unborn child. If you are thinking about becoming pregnant, talk to your healthcare team.

16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION What about pregnancy? Having both diabetes and kidney disease is serious. It can affect your health and the health of your unborn child. If you are thinking about becoming pregnant, talk to your healthcare team. If you become pregnant, you should be under the care of a specialist in highrisk pregnancy and a specialist in kidney disease. Some women may also have a higher risk for kidney failure during pregnancy. You should: Keep your blood sugar levels under control Ask your healthcare professional about using insulin to control your blood sugar while pregnant Tell your healthcare professional about any medicines you are taking, especially medicines for high blood pressure or high cholesterol With good healthcare and careful blood sugar control, it is possible to have a healthy pregnancy. KIDNEY. ORG 17 Key points to remember About a third of people with diabetes may develop kidney failure. Because diabetes may harm the blood vessels in the body, it can cause kidney damage. Early kidney damage from diabetes can be found by a test called uACR that checks for a tiny amount of protein in the urine. A test called eGFR lets your healthcare professional know how much kidney function you have. Treatment with some high blood pressure medicines called ACE inhibitors or ARBs can slow the loss of kidney function in people with diabetes, even in people with normal blood pressure. Treatment with oral antidiabetic (blood sugar lowering) drugs called SGLT2 inhibitors can slow the loss of kidney function in people with and without diabetes. Reducing the amount of sodium (salt) in your diet may be needed if there is kidney damage or high blood pressure. The most common form of sodium is found in table salt. Other things that can cause kidney damage and affect kidney function are: blocking of urine flow, urinary tract infection, and certain medicines (especially NSAIDs such as ibuprofen Motrin and naproxen Aleve). 18 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Early kidney disease rarely has symptoms. That is why it is so important to be tested regularly by your healthcare professional for kidney damage. An early sign of kidney damage is protein in the urine. If chronic kidney disease causes kidney failure, you will need hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or a kidney transplant to replace the work of your kidneys. The type of treatment that is best depends on overall health, lifestyle, and personal preference. Diet is a very important part of the treatment for all patients with diabetes, even if they do not have chronic kidney disease. KIDNEY. ORG 19 Diabetes: A growing epidemic Did you know these facts about diabetes? As of 2018, over 34 million people in the United States (about 10. 5 per cent of the population) have diabetes, and 7. 3 million people do not even know they have the disease. Diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease. Diabetes accounts for 40 to 45 percent of kidney failure. Worldwide, 422 million people have diabetes.

ORG 3 Travel Tips: A Guide for People Living with Chronic Kidney Disease Traveling can require a bit more thought when you have chronic kidney disease (CKD), but rest assured, its very manageable and can be a fun and fantastic experience! CKD means your kidneys arent functioning at full capacity, which is why, when youre planning a trip, its important to plan a little more carefully. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Traveling is Good for You Going on a trip is not just about exploring new places or visiting with friends and family who do not live nearby. Its also incredibly helpful for your mental and emotional well-being. And people who are living with CKD may find that stepping away from their usual routine and ongoing medical care can be truly wonderful. It offers a chance to unwind, enjoy yourself, and have fun experiences. Travel can lift your spirits and be very exciting. Just remember, its important to plan your trips well and to be mindful of any limitations associated with your illness thats how you can make sure your travel experience is as rewarding as the fun places you visit! Pre-Travel Considerations When you are living with CKD, getting ready for a trip means some extra steps to make sure you stay healthy. Its important to speak with your doctor about your travel plans, think about how managing your CKD will fit into your trip, and make sure you have everything you need. Whether adjusting your treatment, packing your medications, or choosing the right travel insurance, taking care of these details before you leave can help you have a smooth and enjoyable trip. KIDNEY. ORG 5 Talk to Your Healthcare Provider Before planning your trip, you should talk to your healthcare provider and dialysis center staff about your travel plans. They can assess your current health, adjust your treatment plan, and provide information and recommendations for your specific needs. Tips: Schedule a pre-travel checkup to discuss your travel plans. Ask about adjusting your treatment plan while you are away. Get a medical summary and a letter from your healthcare provider explaining your medical conditions. Make sure that you are up to date on all vaccines that your healthcare provider recommends. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Preparation Preparing for travel means more than just packing your bags. Youll need to consider how having CKD can affect your travel plans. This means thinking about your medications, dialysis schedules, dietary needs, and how to handle any health issues while away from home. Tips Start planning early at least 6 to 8 weeks before your trip. Organize your medications and pack them in your carry-on luggage.

This means thinking about your medications, dialysis schedules, dietary needs, and how to handle any health issues while away from home. Tips Start planning early at least 6 to 8 weeks before your trip. Organize your medications and pack them in your carry-on luggage. Research and make a list of locations of medical facilities at your destination. Plan your travel schedule around your dialysis needs. Visit dialysisfinder. com to find dialysis locations in the US and globaldialysis. com for international travel. Work with your dialysis team to have home dialysis supplies ordered and shipped so theyre available when you arrive at your destination. Contact staff at your destination to ensure delivery and safe storage. Contact your airline or other transportation provider to discuss how to travel with your dialysis machine. If traveling by air, check the Transportation Security Administration website (tsa. gov/travel/securityscreening/whatcanibring/medical) for information about medical items that are allowed on an aircraft. Discuss with your airline or other transportation provider about access to a space where you can do dialysis if the need should arise. For example, delays during which you cant leave the airplane or during very long flights. KIDNEY. ORG 7 Medications/Medical Information When youre away from home, having easy access to your medications and important health information is vital. This ensures that you can manage your health well and respond quickly in case of an emergency. Tips Save the following information in your smartphone and also carry a hard copy that you keep on your person at all times, including your: Medical summary and letter from your healthcare provider explaining all of your medical conditions. Medication list, including dosages. Medical records and recent lab results. Healthcare providers contact information. Medical and pharmacy insurance cards. Include an ICE (in case of emergency) contact number in your phone. If you have a fistula, ask your dialysis team about getting a no-no wristband that warns medical staff not to use the fistula to draw blood or to give intravenous medications and not to use that arm to take blood pressure.

Starting with a 30-minute walk, three times a week is a good way to get started. Making an Exercise Plan Creating a workout plan is a great first step. Its important to set up a daily exercise plan, figure out how much exercise you need every week, and understand why rest days are important. Setting Up a Routine Having a regular exercise schedule can help you get the most out of being active. You may think about doing different exercises at different times of the day. For example, you could stretch in the morning, lift some light weights in the afternoon, and take a walk in the evening. 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How Often and for How Long Most experts say you should aim for about 150 minutes of heart-pumping exercise each week. You can break this down in different ways to best fit your schedule. For example, you could do five 30-minute workouts or three longer ones that last about 50 minutes each. Taking Breaks Dont forget! Rest days are just as important as the days you exercise. Your muscles need time to recover so you dont get hurt. Make sure to take at least one or two days off each week to rest and recover. Patients on Dialysis and Exercise People on dialysis who exercise regularly report they sleep better, have more energy and more muscle strength, and are better able to do the things they need to do in their lives. Exercise Timing for People on Dialysis Timing your exercise around your dialysis sessions is important for avoiding fatigue and muscle cramps.

Exercise Timing for People on Dialysis Timing your exercise around your dialysis sessions is important for avoiding fatigue and muscle cramps. Its usually best to avoid working out right before or after your dialysis session. Some people find that exercising on non-dialysis days or at least 3 to 4 hours before or after a session works best for them. Some helpful tips include: Be careful about exercising right after hemodialysis, as it may lower your blood pressure too much. KIDNEY. ORG 11 If you want to do weight or resistance training, you should check with your dialysis team before starting, since people on: Hemodialysis should avoid any stress on your fistula or graft arm. Peritoneal dialysis need to make sure that your catheter stays securely in place. Ask your hemodialysis team about exercise with a minibike or any other exercises that can be done during treatments. If you are on peritoneal dialysis, you might be more comfortable exercising on an empty stomach. Skip exercise if youve missed a dialysis session and have extra fluid. Choose Low-Impact Exercises People on dialysis often find that low-impact exercises are the most comfortable. Swimming and cycling are good choices because theyre easier on your joints but still give you a solid workout. Water aerobics is another good choice that is easy on the joints and can improve strength and flexibility. If you are on peritoneal dialysis and would like to swim, talk to your dialysis team about how to protect your exit site and which kinds of water are safe to swim in. 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Keeping Track of Your Health Its really important to keep a close eye on how youre doing if youre on dialysis and starting to exercise. Your healthcare team should know about your exercise plans and may need to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and your dialysis prescription more often. This makes sure that the exercise you choose is both good for you and doesnt cause any problems with your dialysis treatment. KIDNEY. ORG 13 Talk to Your Kidney Dietitian Dialysis and exercise both have an impact on the nutrients in your body. Dialysis can remove some important nutrients, while exercise uses up energy and can affect things like your blood sugar and electrolyte levels. Sweating may also affect how much fluid you need. Thats why its a good idea to talk to a kidney dietitian. They can tell you which foods to eat and how much fluid to drink to keep everything well-balanced. This is especially important if youre planning to exercise more, as youll need the right fuel and fluid to keep you healthy and help your body recover well afterward. 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION A dietitian can also help you adjust your meal timing around your exercise and dialysis schedules for the best results. Listen to Your Body Everyones different, so what works for one person might not work well for you. Pay attention to how you feel during and after exercise.

Listen to Your Body Everyones different, so what works for one person might not work well for you. Pay attention to how you feel during and after exercise. If something doesnt feel right, its important to stop and talk to your healthcare provider. Exercise After Kidney Transplant After a kidney transplant, staying active is still important for keeping healthy. However, there are some special things to think about: Talk to Your Healthcare Team: Talk to your healthcare provider before starting or changing your exercise routine. They can help you understand how your medications and new kidney will react to physical activity. Start Slow: Your body has been through a lot. Start with low-impact exercises and gradually build up your strength. Be Mindful of Surgical Sites: In the early months after a kidney transplant, avoid exercises that put pressure on or involve the surgical area. Monitor for Symptoms: Pay close attention to how you feel during and after exercise. If you notice anything unusual, contact your healthcare provider immediately. KIDNEY. ORG 15 Nutrition and Hydration: Your nutritional needs may be different post-transplant. Talk to your healthcare provider or a kidney dietitian about choosing foods and fluids that are best for you, especially when you are exercising. By paying attention to these important tips, you can exercise in a way thats safe for you and also helps your new kidney work well for a long time. 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Nutrition and Hydration Eating well and staying hydrated are important parts of an effective exercise routine. Here are some tips to help you make good choices before, during, and after your workouts. Plan Your Pre-exercise Meal Eating the right foods before you exercise can give you the energy you need to get through your workout. Try to eat a well-balanced meal about 1 to 2 hours before you start exercising. A meal with plenty of carbohydrates, a moderate amount of protein, and low fat is a good choice. For example, a sandwich made with whole-grain bread and lean meat, along with a side of fruit. Stay Well-hydrated Hydration is super important, especially for people with CKD who may have limits on how much fluid they can have. Always check with your healthcare provider to find out how much you should be drinking when you exercise. A small glass of water before and after your workout is usually a good idea, but your doctor can give you personalized advice. KIDNEY. ORG 17 Eating After Exercise Once youve finished your workout, its important to eat something to help your body recover. Your muscles need protein to repair themselves, and youll need carbohydrates to regain your energy. A lowsugar protein shake or a bowl of whole-grain cereal with skim milk are usually good options. Timing Matters The timing of your meals and hydration can also affect how well you perform and recover. Eating too close to your workout can make you feel sluggish, while not eating enough can leave you feeling weak.

Timing Matters The timing of your meals and hydration can also affect how well you perform and recover. Eating too close to your workout can make you feel sluggish, while not eating enough can leave you feeling weak. Similarly, drinking too much water can make you feel bloated, while not enough can lead to dehydration. Work with your healthcare provider to find the right balance for you. 18 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Special Foods and Supplements Some people consider using special sports drinks, nutrition bars, or dietary supplements such as vitamins and minerals to enhance their exercise performance and recovery. However, these products often contain added sugars, electrolytes, or other compounds that may not be best for people with CKD. Before using any products, check with your healthcare provider to make sure its right for you. Staying Safe While Exercising Safety is a top priority when exercising, especially for people with certain health conditions. Here are some guidelines to help you exercise safely and recognize warning signs. Warm-Up and Cool-Down Starting and finishing your workout the right way can make a big difference. A 5to 10-minute warm-up, like a brisk walk, gets your body ready. After your workout, take another 5 to 10 minutes to cool down with some easy stretches. This helps your muscles relax, and your heart rate returns to normal. KIDNEY. ORG 19 Listen to Your Body Being in tune with your body is key to a safe and effective workout. While exercise should challenge you, it shouldnt cause pain or extreme discomfort. Here are some things watch for: Breathing: Its normal to breathe faster when you exercise, but you should still be able to talk. If youre gasping for air, its a sign to slow down. Muscle Sensations: A mild burn in your muscles is a good sign theyre being worked, but sharp, sudden pain is a red flag. Energy Levels: Feeling tired is part of exercising, but theres a difference between workout fatigue and extreme exhaustion. If you feel like you cant go on, its time to stop. Mental State: Exercise often boosts mood, but if you feel irritable, agitated, or mentally drained, consider winding down your session. Heart Rate: While its normal for your heart rate to increase, it shouldnt feel like your heart is pounding. You may find it helpful to use a monitor to keep track of your heart rate. If you start to feel somethings not right, like youre too tired or hurting, its a good idea to stop exercising right away. Take a break, drink water, and see if you feel better. 20 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Getting Medical Attention Being aware of how you feel during exercise is key to your safety. If you notice any of the following symptoms, its important to stop exercising immediately: Shortness of breath Dizziness or lightheadedness Chest pain or pressure Sudden headache Extreme tiredness Nausea or vomiting These symptoms could be warning signs that something isnt right.

International Journal of Scientific and Technical Research in Engineering (IJSTRE) www. ijstre. com Volume 3 Issue 2 ǁ March 2018. A comprehensive review of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology Adoni Fernando1, Nivethika Sivakumaran1 1(Undergraduate Department of Biomedical Science, International College of Business and Technology, No. 36, De Kretser Place, Bambalapitiya, Sri Lanka) ABSTRACT: This review was written to provide a comprehensive summary of the suggested etiologies of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology (CKDu) in Sri Lanka. In this review, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is explained in detail and its known etiologies are discussed. CKDu is defined and its epidemiology is discussed, with the compilation of statistic from over 15 research papers through the years 2000 to present. KEYWORDS: Chronic agrochemical nephrology, Chronic Kidney Disease, Chronic Kidney Disease of multifactorial origin, Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown etiology, Chronic interstitial nephritis of agricultural communities ABBREVIATIONS: CKDu: Chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology, CKD: Chronic Kidney Disease, CKDmfo: Chronic Kidney Disease of multifactorial origin, CINAC: Chronic Interstitial Nephritis in Agricultural Communities, NCP: North Central Province (of Sri Lanka), CRF: Chronic Renal Failure, CRDChronic Renal Disease, GFRGlomerular Filtration Rate, NFKNational Kidney Foundation (USA), KDQOIKidney Disease Quality Outcome Initiative, ESRDEnd Stage Renal Disease, BMIBody Mass Index, NSAIDNon Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug, DDTDichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, CdCadmium, PbLead, UUranium, NNitrogen, KPotassium I. INTRODUCTION Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as kidney damage or a decreased glomerular filtration rate. CKD is characterized by progressive destruction of renal mass, with irreversible sclerosis and loss of nephrons over a period of time, depending on the underlying etiology. Diabetes, hypertension and different forms of glomerular nephritis are known etiologies of CKD 1. The rising prevalence of non-infectious diseases such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension suggests that CKD incidence will continue to rise 2. Over the last two decades, the epidemic of a new strain of CKD of unknown etiology in rural farming communities of Sri Lanka, has elevated the concern of the disease. This new strain has been observed to be endemic in agricultural and rural regions. CKDu may also be referred to as CKD of multifactorial origin (CKDmfo), chronic agrochemical nephrology (CAN) or chronic interstitial nephritis of agricultural communities (CINAC) 3. The disease is prevalent especially in the North Central Province (NCP). It is observed in mainly the dry regions that may utilize irrigation methods for farming. It disproportionately affects males of poor socio-economic background and workers of paddy farming 4, 5. In Sri Lanka there is an estimated affected population of 400, 000 people and death toll of around 20, 000 people. CKDu is not exclusive to Sri Lanka, and many cases of CKD of unknown etiology have been reported in different parts of the world; e. g. , Costa Rica 6, India 7, Egypt 8, Nicaragua 9, and more. However, in Sri Lanka, there is limited knowledge on the exact prevalence and geographical distribution of CKDu at this time.

However, in Sri Lanka, there is limited knowledge on the exact prevalence and geographical distribution of CKDu at this time. Even with the suggestion of many etiologies, the limited supporting evidence means that the exact cause of the disease is still unknown. Water contamination is a popular suggestion, but the evidence supporting the claim is insufficient. The role of environmental exposure to high concentrations of nephrotoxicants (such as, Cd, Pb, and U), which may accumulate and cause functional and structural damage in renal tissue, is a weighty hypothesis Manuscript id. 631855358 www. ijstre. com A comprehensive review of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology 10. Farming and the use of fertilizer or other agrochemicals are also considered risk factors 11, 12. High levels of as exposure is also suggested to be an etiological factor in CKDu 13. Water used for consumption is thought to be a major source of contaminants that lead to CKD. The contaminants may seep into water from the natural environment (geological sources), but the intensive use of agrochemicals to increase the production of agricultural resources is also a significant possibility of water contamination. The local water bodies may be polluted with seepage from irrigation or farming, especially those that lay close to fields used for cultivation. A systematic assessment of water quality is therefore needed, in order to understand risk related to exposure and assess the potential health effects 14. This review attempts to provide a comprehensive understanding of CKDu and its prevalence in Sri Lanka. It attempts to document the possible etiologies of CKDu, put forward by research throughout the year 1997 to present. The endemic regions in North Western Province of Sri Lanka is shown in Fig. 1. Polpithigama is identified as a high risk geographic area for CKDu (Screening Guidelines Chronic Kidney Disease Sri Lanka 2017 Epidemiology Unit Ministry of Health, 2017). Nikawewa has a high prevalence of the disease and has two specialized nephrology units, catering to CKD patients. Figure 1. Nephrology units and satellite clinics for kidney diseases in Sri Lanka (Daily News, 2017) II. CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE Chronic Kidney Disease is recognized as a global public health problem. The disease is coined from the kidneys functions progressively diminishing over time due to the progressive damage of the renal mass. CKD is also known as Chronic Renal Failure (CRF), Chronic Renal Disease (CRD) and Chronic Kidney Failure (CKF). CKD can be defined as structural or functional anomalies of the kidneys or a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), persisting for a period of three months, (60 ml/min or 1. 73 m2). Manuscript id. 631855358 www. ijstre. com A comprehensive review of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology 2. 1. Functions of the kidneys The main functions of the kidneys are; filtration of waste products and excess water from blood to be excreted through urine, regulation of blood pressure, production of erythropoietin (important for formation of red blood cells, and maintaining balance of salts and chemicals in bloodstream at the right level(NFK, www.

kidney. org). CKD is a slowly progressing disease, and often goes unnoticed and underdiagnosed. It is usually asymptomatic until histopathological features such as tubulointestitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, observed in renal biopsies. Usually when the signs and symptoms manifest, the disease has reached to a severity, for which the cure is a kidney transplant, without which there is a 100% mortality rate. The conditions of a CKD patient irreversibly worsen over time. 2. 2. Stages of CKD CKD is diagnosed based on definition of the Kidney Disease Quality Outcome Initiative (KDQOI) of the National Kidney Foundation (NFK). The functional damage of kidneys can be assessed by GFR, and the disease can be classified into 5 stages such as, stage 1: Kidney damage with normal or increased GFR (90 mL/min /1. 73 m2), stage 2: Mild reduction in GFR (60-89 mL/min/1. 73 m2), stage 3: Moderate reduction in GFR (30-59 mL/min/1. 73 m2), stage 4: Severe reduction in GFR (15-29 mL/min/1. 73 m2), and stage 5: Kidney failure (GFR 15 mL/min/1. 73 m2 or dialysis). CKD is usually detected when the kidneys function drops to 25% of normal kidney function, whereas symptoms appear when the function plummets to 1/10th of the normal level. Each kidney has approximately one million nephrons, the functional unit of kidney, which filter wastes from the body. The human body can maintain the normal GFR, even when there is a gradual destruction of the nephrons. This happens by mechanisms to compensate for the loss, such as hypertrophy of renal tissue and hyper filtration by the surviving nephrons. This occurs regardless of the underlying etiology of the CKD, and allows blood to be filtered and the plasma solutes to be cleared as it would in normal conditions. When GFR decreases to 50% of normal, the level of plasma solutes such as creatinine and urea show a significant increase. The creatinine in plasma will be approximately double that of normal, when GFR drops to 50%; i. e. , when the plasma creatinine reaches 1. 2 mg/dL from the baseline value of 0. 6 mg/dL, it represents halving of the functional nephron mass, although it is still within the defined reference range. 2. 3. Known etiologies of Chronic Kidney Disease Certain common chronic diseases can lead to chronic kidney disease. These diseases can damage the renal tissue permanently causing damage and giving rise to CKD. 2. 3. 1. Diabetes mellitus CKD was thought to develop as a result of diabetes and was known as diabetic nephropathy. The elevated levels of blood glucose leads to an increased strain on the nephrons of the kidneys when filtering blood. It is estimated that moderate to severe CKD is found in 15-23% of patients that have a history of diabetes 15. 2. 3. 2. Hypertension High blood pressure is a leading cause of CKD globally. Hypertension damages the blood vessels and may lead to a reduced blood flow to kidneys. The elevated pressure can also damage the nephrons assisting renal damage.

2. 3. 2. Hypertension High blood pressure is a leading cause of CKD globally. Hypertension damages the blood vessels and may lead to a reduced blood flow to kidneys. The elevated pressure can also damage the nephrons assisting renal damage. More than 50% of the CKD patients suffer from hypertension (High Blood Pressure and Chronic Kidney Disease www. kidney. org National Kidney Foundations Kidney disease outcomes Quality initiative, n. d. ). Diabetes mellitus and hypertension are the identified major etiologies of CKD. In addition, Tubulointerstitial disease has been seen to have a strong link to CKD in Sri Lanka. There has been a significant prevalence of CKD observed in toxic nephropathies due to tubulointerstitial disease. There are a few identified causes of tubulointerstitial disease such as heavy metals, radiation nephritis, chronic hyperkalemia, chronic hypercalcemia, etc. 16. Progressive kidney diseases that lead to CKD may also be caused by proteinuria, systemic hypertension, elevated nephrotoxins or decreased perfusion, smoking, uncontrolled diabetes, illegal drug abuse, physical injury, and many more. Manuscript id. 631855358 www. ijstre. com A comprehensive review of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology III. CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE OF UNKNOWN ETIOLOGY (CKDu) The Health Ministry Circular defines CKDu as renal damage with no past history or current treatment for diabetes mellitus, chronic and/or severe hypertension, snake bites, urological disease of known etiology or glomerulonephritis; with normal HbA1C (glycated Hb6. 5%); and blood pressure at 160/100 mmHg or 140/90 mmHg on up to two antihypertensive drugs. CKDu endemic occurrences was noted recognized in 1990, and has been increasing to date. 3. 1. Epidemiology of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology (CKDu) The outbreak and prevalence of CKD of unknown etiology was first recognized in the early 1990s in the NCP, namely Dehiattakandiya, Padaviya, Girandurukotte, Kabithigollawa, Medawachiya, Medirigiriya and Nikawewa of Sri Lanka, according to hospital records as shown in Fig. 2. It was later found that the disease was endemic to agricultural communities. Figure 2. CKD/CKDu prevalence (2015) (Daily News, 2017) In February 2017, the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health, Nutrition Indigenous Medicine released an epidemiology report publication (Vol. 44 No. 07), highlighting the regions in which CKDu was endemic and had a very high prevalence (Screening Guidelines Chronic Kidney Disease Sri Lanka 2017 Epidemiology Unit Ministry of Health, 2017). The identified high risk geographic areas for CKDu in Sri Lanka are shown in Table 1. Table 1.

A population screening of endemic regions shows that a cohort of the younger members of the population is also affected by the disease, with a distinctly high incidence reported in Medawachchiya. The prevalence of CKDu in the overall population was measured to be 3. 7% (n4107), whilst the prevalence of disease in the adult (18 years of age) population was noted to be 5% (n2600). The ratio of distribution of disease in respect to gender (female: male) was 1: 1. 3 17. According the WHO report on the Kidney Disease of Uncertain Etiology (CKDu) in Sri Lanka, there is a 16. 9% age standardized prevalence of CKDu among females within age group 15-70 years, and a 12. 9% prevalence of males in the same age group. The main sources of water used for consumption, in CKDu affected regions, are shallow and deep wells. It is reported that in the areas with very high prevalence of CKDu, nearly 87% of the population utilize either dug well and tube well water for their daily needs. Water is used in cooking and is usually boiled before consumption, but is otherwise untreated 18. The number of patients treated for kidney disease have shown an increase in the years 2001-02, and the main identified cause of renal damage is CKDu. In another report by Athuraliya, it was found that 2-3% of the population are affected by CKDu, in identified endemic areas. It was also reported around 5000 patients undergoing treatment, in places with high prevalence of CKDu, due to renal failure at the time, and more than 9000 patients are followed up at the regional hospitals. Each year there are about 2000 patients diagnosed with the end stage of renal disease, with urgent need of kidney transplantation; without which, there is a 100% mortality rate 17. Population screening carried out by a technique of multistage sampling, had resulted in a CKDu point prevalence of about 2-3% in subjects over 18 years of age 21. Grounds view 2012 reported around 1500 deaths due to CKD nationwide. There was a reported 12. 9% rate of CKDu increase 12. A hospital based CKD registry was established in Sri Lanka by the WHO in 2009, with four hospitals in Anuradhapura, Medirigiriya, Polonnaruwa and Medawachchiya, in the NCP. There was a total of 1997 CKD patients, of which 775 cases (39%) were CKDu cases. CKDu as a percentage of the total number of cases of CKD is as follows: Anuradhapura48%, Medirigiriya25%, Pollonaruwa14%, Medawachchiya13%. 72% of the total patients of CKDu was seen to be male, whilst 28% was female. Another study carried out by the WHO found that 15% of the population of the NCP are affected by CKDu 19, 20. CKDu was classified as a middle farmers disease, as the mean age of the male patients with CKDu was 45. 5 years, whilst it was found to be 47. 4 years in females 22.

CKDu was classified as a middle farmers disease, as the mean age of the male patients with CKDu was 45. 5 years, whilst it was found to be 47. 4 years in females 22. However, in a previous study carried out in 2007, it was found that the mean age of male CKDu patients was 56. 7 years, and the mean age of females was found to be 54. 2 years 23. This decreasing mean age of the CKDu patients supports that CKDu is a suggestive of the possible cumulating effects of toxins in the pathogenesis of the disease 24. Manuscript id. 631855358 www. ijstre. com A comprehensive review of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology 3. 2. Suggested etiologies of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology (CKDu) There are many suggested explanations for the etiology of the CKDu, the hypotheses that have the highest significance in CKDu in Sri Lanka have been explained below. 3. 2. 1. Cadmium It was put forward that the high contents of cadmium being consumed by the population in the dry zone was the cause of the high prevalence of CKDu. It was reported that large amounts of cadmium entered the body through water, fish and lotus rhizomes 25. The study said that the high content of cadmium could be due to the mass use of phosphate fertilizer contaminated with cadmium. However, this theory was refuted in another 2010 study, which found out that there were higher cadmium levels in regions in the non-endemic region whilst compared to the endemic regions. The clinical evidence of this study, also didnt show any other diseases that appear when there is high exposure to cadmium, such as renal calculi, respiratory effects and bone disease, which usually manifest prior to renal damage. 3. 2. 2. Arsenic The presence of calcium arsenate crystals deposited in post-mortem test of CKD affected kidneys, suggested that consumption of arsenic and calcium in increased levels was the cause of CKDu. The areas that the study was carried out had an increased level of as and hardness of water. The calcium of the hard water, along with the arsenic leads to the formation of the calcium arsenate crystals that bind to arsenic transporters in the liver and moves to the renal tissue where it interrupts the kidneys antioxidant defense. The study found 0. 02-0. 1 ppm of arsenic in drinking water, greater than that of the WHO recommended value of 0. 01 ppm. The clinical assessment discovered a high level of arsenic in hair (mean of 460 ppb). Even though the Sri Lankan government has banned the use of arsenic in pesticides in 2001, there is speculation that it is still being used illegally. A study presented by Dr. Jayasumana, showed that there was 0. 18-2. 58 ppm of arsenic found in the agrochemicals used by Sri Lankan farmers.

A study presented by Dr. Jayasumana, showed that there was 0. 18-2. 58 ppm of arsenic found in the agrochemicals used by Sri Lankan farmers. This study however brings to light, that these agrochemicals are used throughout Sri Lanka, but only certain regions show high prevalence of CKDu, whilst other regions remain non-endemic 24, 26. 3. 2. 3. Aluminium Fluoride According to one study, the CKDu endemic regions had fluoride rich water and the population relied on substandard utensils for cooking and storage of water. The acidic conditions during cooking, and the emanation of aluminum from these pots and pans during different levels of fluoride was studied. The amount of aluminum leached into the water in the absence of an acidic component was relatively small (1. 20 ppmafter 10 mins of boiling a 6ppm fluoride solution). In acidic conditions of pH 3. 02 (using tamarind), even in the absence of fluoride, there was 18 ppm aluminum leached from the utensils; with regular increases in the emanated aluminum with the increase in fluoride content. After 10 mins of boiling in a 6ppm fluoride solution, with acidic additives, the amount of aluminum that had seeped in to solution was 29 ppm. It was observed that the fluoride in water encourages aluminum leaching into the food being cooked, and the aluminofluoride complexes possibly can be an etiological factor causing CKDu. The hypothesis suggested that since there is greater use of inferior quality aluminium utensils, that are made of recycled scrap metal and alloys, there is high chance that they are also contaminated with other heavy metals, such as lead, which are potentially poisonous to the renal tissues, contributing to CKDu 14, 27, 28. However the study didnt explain how the CKDu is restricted to certain geographical regions, even though the use of these low quality utensils are present throughout the nation. 3. 2. 4. Hardness of water A strong positive correlation (p0. 008) was seen between hard water and the arsenic content of water in CKDu endemic regions, when compared to the regions with less prevalence of CKDu, which showed a weak correlation. This study also implicated that the consumption of the hard water along with the elevated levels of arsenic was a Manuscript id. 631855358 www. ijstre. com A comprehensive review of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology possible etiological factor of CKDu 29. 96% of the CKDu patients consumed hard water for a minimum of 5 years 22. According to a preliminary study on the hard water of three districts of NCP Padaviya, Medawachchiya and Kabithigollawa and Ampara district of the WP. The study found high levels of calcium, magnesium and zinc in the water used for consumption. However there was no detectable traces of arsenic, lead or mercury. The water was tested from the regions with significantly high prevalence of CKD. The preliminary findings did include brittle bones, which is a symptom of hard water 19.

However there was no detectable traces of arsenic, lead or mercury. The water was tested from the regions with significantly high prevalence of CKD. The preliminary findings did include brittle bones, which is a symptom of hard water 19. Figure 3-Distribution of hard water (left) and distribution and prevalence of CKDu in Sri Lanka (right)in Sri Lanka(Jayasumana, Gunatilake and Senanayake, 2014) 3. 2. 5. Low selenium Selenium concentration of 80-95 µg/l is needed by the body and has been shown to protect the kidneys from oxidative stress. In the study carried out in 2013, it was seen that 38% of CKDu patients showed a serum selenium concentration below 80 µg/land below 90 µg/l in 63% of individuals affecting CKDu. Therefore it was suggested that low selenium levels may be a contributory factor making the kidneys more vulnerable to oxidative damage that can be caused by heavy metals and metalloids. Deficiency of selenium seen in individuals with CKD suggest that it is possibly a predisposition to the development of CKDu 12. 3. 2. 6. Pesticides The popular belief among the locals of the affected regions is that the use of pesticides and its bioaccumulation, is the causative factor of the renal complications and CKD they face. It is believed that the pesticides have leached into the drinking water and the food grown using these agrochemicals. The local fish varieties have perished and effects are even seen in their cattle. The Minneriya Irrigation System caused many people from the wet zones of the country to settle into the NCP in the 1950s. The older generation (settlers) in this area are not as affected as the younger cohort (mostly children of the settlers) who began farming in the endemic regions. The condition worsened after the introduction of the green revolution 19. The pesticide usage in paddy cultivation and Manuscript id. 631855358 www. ijstre. com A comprehensive review of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology vegetable growing regions is significantly high, though there is no provincial data available. These regions include those that have recorded significantly higher levels of CKDu, such as Polonnaruwa, Anuradhapura, Ampara, and Badulla. 3. 2. 7. Ayurvedic medicine Aristolochic acid was suggested to be an etiological factor of BEN, as the wheat used in the Balkan regions was found to be contaminated with Aristolochia clemantis. Therefore, this initiated studies to be carried out into the ayurvedic medicine used in Sri Lanka, to test for the presence of Aristocholic acid to explain renal disease. Research conducted have observed that the use of these herbal medication produces nephrotoxic effects in experimental animals and patients. It was observed that around 90% of the ayurvedic practitioners used alternative medical remedies, whilst only 10% used Aristoclochiaindica (Sapsanda) as an ingredient in their recipes. Sapsanda was used as a remedy for few diseases as well as for poisonous bites, the most common method of use was external application.

It was observed that around 90% of the ayurvedic practitioners used alternative medical remedies, whilst only 10% used Aristoclochiaindica (Sapsanda) as an ingredient in their recipes. Sapsanda was used as a remedy for few diseases as well as for poisonous bites, the most common method of use was external application. Therefore, it was concluded that the use of nephrotoxic herbal medication was not a causal factor for CKDu found in the NCP 30. 3. 2. 8. Glyphosate Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in the endemic areas of disease. Glyphosate and related compounds are known to have strong chelating properties, however, no serious consideration has been given to the possible effects of these compounds on human health. This could be due to the fact that glyphosate in its original form is known to be an easily degradable compound in the natural environment, and its effectiveness as an herbicide. The GMA lattice hypothesis states that glyphosate can be absorbed through the dermis or through inhalation into body directly. It can also leach into the water bodies to form glyphosate metal complexes (the endemic regions are known to have elevated hardness). This allows another route for glyphosate to enter into body. These glyphosate compounds can lead to oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, apoptosis and necrosis of the renal tissue; leading to glomerular sclerosis, glomerular collapse, proximal tubular damage and tubulointerstitial damage. This evidenced by the elevated excretion of As, Cd, heavy metals, glyphosate and AMPA in urine of healthy individuals, whilst patients with CKDu have significantly lower levels of these compound excreted in urine. Although glyphosate alone might not be the cause of CKDu, it is arguable that the raised levels of glyphosate in endemic regions, coupled with localized geo environmental factors and nephrotoxic substances causes renal damage, which may lead to CKDu 29. 3. 2. 9. Bioaccumulation Most CKDu endemic areas are around tanks and reservoirs. The big tanks are usually home to many plants and aquatic animals. The bioaccumulation of pesticide residues, toxins and heavy metals in these organisms is a major area of concern. Both the Mahaweli Irrigation system and the Minneriya Irrigation System both exist in the dry zone, namely NCP. Water travels through hills, tanks and eventually the fields, and has an elevated level of hardness of water, along with pesticide residues, toxins and heavy metals. 3. 2. 10. Smoking There was a significantly increased risk of ESRD in renal disease when compared to nonsmokers, in Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial. This difference was independent of other factors such as age, gender, diabetes mellitus hypertension, ethnicity etc. 31. In diabetic individuals, smoking is known to increase the risk of nephropathy. Smoking was identified as a known risk factor for microalbuminuria. Microalbuminuria is recognized to be a marker of renal damage and hence CKD. There is a five times more likely chance of microalbuminuria in the subjects who have a history of smoking when compared to subjects with no history of smoking.

Microalbuminuria is recognized to be a marker of renal damage and hence CKD. There is a five times more likely chance of microalbuminuria in the subjects who have a history of smoking when compared to subjects with no history of smoking. The findings of the study postulate that groundwater, along with cigarette consumption are probable sources of environmental toxin that may lead to CKDu 25. Manuscript id. 631855358 www. ijstre. com A comprehensive review of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology 3. 2. 11. Cyanobacterial toxin All the regions that are known to have a high prevalence of the CKD, is clustered around tanks and reservoirs of the irrigation system. A lower prevalence was observed in the communities that used water from natural springs for consumption. The water sampled from these natural springs, showed an absence of cyanobacteria and algae. The water contained very low levels of fluoride, nitrogen, phosphate and potassium. The analysis of the water from the reservoirs showed the presence of cyanobacterial blooms that are capable of producing hepatotoxic effects and carcinogenic effects. The regions that are endemic to CKD are seen to have many reservoirs which could explain the high prevalence of the disease (Athuraliya et al. , 2009). 3. 2. 12. Drinking well water One study found that in male farmers in PadaviSripura, who spray glyphosate have an increased risk of CKDu coupled with consumption of well water and have a history of consumption from an abandoned well for a period of more than 5 years. Univariable analysis found that consumption of water from an abandoned well increased the risk of contracting CKDu by 7 times. The abandonment of wells that were previously used for drinking water is a commonly observed phenomenon in CKDu endemic areas. The reasoning provided by the locals is that the water is not palatable and therefore unsuitable for drinking or cooking purposes, due to the increase in hardness of water. This leads to the locals having to travel further to obtain water, however more and more wells are being abandoned due to the progression of hard water. Therefore drinking water from a well and from abandoned wells, are used as significant predictors of CKDu 22. 3. 2. 13. Dehydration Due to the increasing hardness of water in wells of the PadaviSripura area, the locals need to travel further to obtain water for consumption. This scarcity of water, may lead to less consumption of water leading to dehydration. Dehydration further causes complications to the kidneys, resulting in renal tissue damage, which invariably leads to CKD. There are more suggested hypotheses put forward in relation to the etiology of CKDu in Sri Lanka.

This scarcity of water, may lead to less consumption of water leading to dehydration. Dehydration further causes complications to the kidneys, resulting in renal tissue damage, which invariably leads to CKD. There are more suggested hypotheses put forward in relation to the etiology of CKDu in Sri Lanka. This includes maternal malnutrition, consumption of untreated water from the fields, low intake of calcium, ionic species in water, oxidative stress on renal tissue due to multifactorial origin, genetic predisposition, low BMI, chronic undernutrition, organophosphates, synergy of As and CD, used of NSAIDs, the use of synthetic fertilizers, history of snake bites, consumption of water directly from reservoirs, fungal and bacterial toxins 9. IV. CONCLUSION The Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization estimate that around 15% of the population found in endemic areas are susceptible to develop CKDu. This greatly increases the national socioeconomic burden on the public healthcare system. The specific etiologic causative agent behind CKDu is still unknown. However the suggested hypotheses discussed in this review provides insight for any further research to build on. V.

Healthy Eating for Adults with Chronic Kidney Disease In this section: Why is healthy eating important for adults with CKD? What aspects of nutrition are important for adults with CKD? How can I eat healthy with CKD? What is medical nutrition therapy? Clinical Trials for Healthy Eating for Adults with CKD Why is healthy eating important for adults with CKD? Healthy kidneys balance salts and minerals in the blood. When you have chronic kidney disease (CKD), the kidneys cant filter your blood the way they should. What you eat and drink can help your kidneys maintain a healthy balance of salts and minerals in your body and help you feel better. Choosing healthy foods and beveragesand avoiding foods high in sodium, potassium, and phosphorusmay prevent or delay some health problems from CKD. What you eat and drink may also affect how well your kidney disease treatments work. Understanding how different nutrients and liquids affect the body is important for people with CKD. As CKD advances, nutritional needs change. Your health care professional may recommend you choose foods more carefully and may suggest you work with a registered dietitian, if possible, to create an eating plan for your individual needs. You can find a registered dietitian External link who specializes in kidney disease through the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics online or through your health care professional. The nutritional needs for children with CKD are different than for adults. Learn more. What aspects of nutrition are important for adults with CKD? Calories The foods and beverages you eat and drink give your body energy. The energy is measured in calories. If you consume fewer calories than your body uses, you may lose weight. Losing too much weight can make you sicker. Fat Fat gives your body energy, helps control your cholesterol and blood pressure levels, and helps your body absorb vitamins. Fat also provides nutrients your body needs and is an important part of a healthy eating plan. Everyone needs some fat in their diet, but too much fat or choosing foods higher in saturated fat or trans fat may cause buildup in your blood vessels, heart, and kidneys. People with CKD have a higher risk of developing heart and blood vessel disease NIH external link and should focus on consuming healthier unsaturated fats while limiting saturated and trans fats. Liquids Your body needs liquids to function properly. However, people with CKD may need to limit how much liquid they consume because damaged kidneys cant remove extra fluid. Talk with your health care professional about how much liquid you should have each day. Phosphorus Damaged kidneys cant remove phosphorus from the blood as well as healthy kidneys can. Phosphorus can build up in the blood in people with CKD. Too much phosphorus in your blood can harm your blood vessels and make your bones thin, weak, and more likely to break. High levels of phosphorus in your blood can also cause itchy skin and bone and joint pain.

Phosphorus can build up in the blood in people with CKD. Too much phosphorus in your blood can harm your blood vessels and make your bones thin, weak, and more likely to break. High levels of phosphorus in your blood can also cause itchy skin and bone and joint pain. Potassium CKD can make it harder for the kidneys to remove potassium from the blood, and the potassium levels in the blood can become very high. Having too little or too much potassium in your blood can cause heart and muscle problems. For this reason, its important to work with a dietitian or health care professional to help find the right amount of potassium for you. Protein Protein helps build and maintain muscle, bone, skin, connective tissue, internal organs, and blood. Protein also helps fight disease and heal wounds. As your body uses protein, the protein breaks down into waste. Your kidneys remove this waste from the blood. Some people with CKD may need to consume moderate amounts of protein so waste doesnt build up in the blood. However, too little protein may lead to malnutrition, a condition that occurs when your body doesnt get enough nutrients. Work with a dietitian or health care professional to find the right balance of protein to make sure you are properly nourished without causing strain to your kidneys. Sodium Sodium is a mineral that helps control the amount of fluids in your body. Sodium is found in table salt and in many processed foods. Too much sodium causes your blood to retainor hold on tofluids. When your body retains fluids, it can cause high blood pressure and swelling, putting stress on your kidneys and heart. Be aware of the amount of sodium in the foods and beverages you consume and work with your dietitian or health care professional to determine your sodium limit. A smiling woman holding a grocery bag of food in her kitchen. Eating healthy with CKD can help your kidneys maintain a healthy balance of salts and minerals in your body and can help you feel better. How can I eat healthy with CKD? There is no single meal plan for everyone with CKD. In the early stages of CKD, you may have few limits to what you can eat and drink. As your CKD advances and your nutritional needs change, you may need to make more changes to your diet. Talk with your health care team about challenges you may have finding healthy food. A health care professional, dietitian, or social worker may be able to recommend resources that can help you. The U. S. Department of Agriculture also has a list of resources External link for finding and affording healthy food. Pay attention to calories People with CKD may avoid eating because they dont feel hungry or because foods or beverages dont taste the same.

The U. S. Department of Agriculture also has a list of resources External link for finding and affording healthy food. Pay attention to calories People with CKD may avoid eating because they dont feel hungry or because foods or beverages dont taste the same. If you find that you dont feel like eating, talk with a dietitian or health care professional to make sure you are getting enough calories and that the calories are from nutritious sources. Your dietitian or health care professional can help you find healthy ways to get the calories your body needs. Choose heart-healthy foods You may protect your heart health and lower your chance of developing heart and blood vessel disease by replacing saturated fats and trans fats in your diet with healthier unsaturated fats, which include monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats. Monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fatsfound in foods such as canola oil, safflower oil, avocados, nuts, and seedsare healthy alternatives to saturated fats and trans fats. Saturated fats and trans fats can raise cholesterol levels and clog blood vessels. Saturated fats, which are found in animal products such as red meat, poultry, and butter, are usually solid at room temperature. Trans fats can be found in fast foods, fried foods, commercially produced baked goods, and other foods cooked with partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated oil or shortening. Tips for following a heart-healthy diet include Choose heart-healthy foods NIH external link, including plenty of fruits and vegetables. Grill, broil, bake, roast, air-fry, or stir-fry foods, instead of deep-frying. Cook with nonstick cooking spray or a small amount of olive oil instead of butter. Trim fat from meat and remove skin from poultry before eating. Limit saturated and trans fats. Look for the amount of saturated fat External link and trans fat External link on the Nutrition Facts label. Limit alcohol. Ask your health care professional how much alcohol is safe for you. Talk with your dietitian or health care professional about healthy ways you can include fat in your diet External link. Track your liquids You may need to adjust how much liquid you have each day, depending on your kidney function. A dietitian or health care professional can work with you to determine how much liquid you should have each day. Contact your health care professional if you notice any swelling in your face, arms, legs, or abdomen. Choose foods and drinks with less phosphorus Phosphorus is found naturally in foods that are rich in protein, such as meat, dairy products, and beans. Phosphorus is also added to many foods. Phosphorus additives are the primary source of phosphorus for many people. Tips to reduce phosphorus in your diet include Limit or avoid packaged and processed foods and drinks that have added phosphorus, such as deli meats, flavored drinks, and other processed foods.

Check Nutrition Facts labels External link for added phosphorus. Look for phosphorus or words with PHOS, such as phosphoric acid, disodium phosphate, and monosodium phosphate on the ingredient list. Eat larger portions of fruits and vegetables, which are naturally low in phosphorus, and smaller portions of foods high in phosphorus. Keep in mind, your body absorbs more phosphorus from animal-based foods, such as meat and poultry, than from plant-based foods, such as beans and seeds. Some packaged meats and poultry have added phosphorus. Ask someone who works in the meat department to show you which meats do not have added phosphorus. A health care professional can check your blood phosphorus level using a blood test NIH external link. Foods and drinks with added phosphorus may cause your blood phosphorus level to go up more than foods and drinks that naturally contain phosphorus. Your dietitian or health care professional may suggest changes to what you eat and drink to help keep your phosphorus level in a healthy range. As kidney disease advances, you may need to take a phosphate binder with meals to lower the amount of phosphorus in your blood. A phosphate binder is a medicine that acts like a sponge to soak up, or bind, phosphorus while it is in the stomach. Because it is bound, the phosphorus does not get into your blood. Instead, your body removes the phosphorus through your stool. Choose foods that help keep your potassium level in the goal range Your food and drink choices can help you keep your potassium level in a healthy range. If your potassium level is high, your health care professional may recommend you Limit serving sizes of foods that contain potassium. Keep in mind that a large serving of a lower-potassium food may have more potassium than a small serving of a higher-potassium food. Use spices and herbs instead of salt substitutes, which can be high in potassium. Limit foods with potassium chloride on the ingredient list. Potassium chloride is sometimes used in place of salt in some packaged foods. Drain canned fruits and vegetables and throw out the liquid, which is often high in potassium. Use food preparation and cooking methods, such as boiling and leaching, that can lower the amount of potassium in certain vegetables. If you have diabetes and your blood glucose levelalso called blood sugar levelgets low, choose apple, grape, or cranberry juice instead of other fruit juices that are higher in potassium, such as orange juice. A health care professional can check your potassium level using a blood test NIH external link. Talk with your dietitian or health care professional about ways you can adjust your food and drink choices to meet your potassium goal. Your health care professional may suggest you take a potassium binder to lower the amount of potassium in your blood. Similar to phosphate binders, potassium binders are medicines that prevent some potassium from getting into the blood. The potassium is removed from the body through your stool.

Your health care professional may suggest you take a potassium binder to lower the amount of potassium in your blood. Similar to phosphate binders, potassium binders are medicines that prevent some potassium from getting into the blood. The potassium is removed from the body through your stool. Taking certain medicines, as well as skipping dialysis treatments, can also raise your potassium level. Your health care professional may adjust the medicines you take if your potassium level is too high. If you receive dialysis treatments, be sure to attend all dialysis sessions to help prevent potassium from building up in your blood. A grandfather has dinner with his daughter and granddaughter. Talk with your dietitian or health care professional about changes you can make to what you eat and drink if your CKD gets worse. Choose the amount and types of protein your body needs Protein is in many foods you eat, including foods from plants and animals. You may need to adjust the amount of protein in your diet to help keep your kidneys healthier longer. Your protein needs may also change over time. Work with your dietitian or health care professional to find the amount and sources of protein External link you should include in your diet. Your health care professional may recommend you limit how much meat and dairy foods you consume get the rest of your protein from plant-based foods choose lean, or low-fat, meats that also are low in phosphorus If you dont eat animal products, eat a variety of plant-based proteins to meet your bodys protein needs. People with CKD who are on dialysis may need to eat more protein because the dialysis treatment removes protein from the blood. The amount of protein removed from the blood depends on the type of dialysis treatment. For example, peritoneal dialysis removes more protein than hemodialysis. A variety of animaland plant-based proteins on a cutting board. Talk with your dietitian or health care professional about the amount and sources of protein you should include in your diet. Choose and prepare foods with less salt and sodium Most Americans consume more sodium than they should. Much of this sodium comes from packaged, prepared, and restaurant foods, not from a saltshaker. Even foods that dont taste salty can be high in sodium. Canned foods, some frozen foods, and most processed meats contain large amounts of salt. Snack foods such as chips and crackers are also high in salt. Table salt, some seasonings, ketchup, mustard, and certain sauces such as barbecue, soy, and teriyaki sauces are high in sodium. The 20202025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans External link recommends adults limit their sodium to no more than 2, 300 milligrams per day. 1 Many people with CKD need to limit their sodium even more. Your health care professional can determine your sodium limit, based on your kidney health. Tips to reduce sodium in your diet External link include Limit the amount of prepared, packaged, and fast foods you eat.

1 Many people with CKD need to limit their sodium even more. Your health care professional can determine your sodium limit, based on your kidney health. Tips to reduce sodium in your diet External link include Limit the amount of prepared, packaged, and fast foods you eat. Choose unprocessed meats instead of processed meats. Check for sodium on the Nutrition Facts label External link of food packages. A % Daily Value External link of 20% or more means the food is high in sodium, and a value of 5% or less means the food is low in sodium. Look for foods labeled sodium free, salt free, very low sodium, low sodium, reduced or less sodium, no salt added, unsalted, or lightly salted. Eat more fresh, frozen, and canned fruits and vegetables without added sauce, seasonings, sodium, or salt. Drain and rinse canned vegetables, beans, meats, and fish with water to remove extra salt. Cook foods from scratch. When you prepare your own food, you control what goes into it. Use spices, herbs, and sodium-free seasonings in place of salt. Use alternative seasonings, such as lemon juice, herbs, and hot peppers. Try slowly reducing the amount of sodium in your diet over time. Your taste buds will gradually adjust, and you wont notice the change in flavor. A Nutrition Facts label highlighting serving size, number of servings, and percent daily value for sodium. There may be more than one serving in the package, so be sure to check serving size. Percent daily value for sodium tells you how much sodium in one serving contributes to a daily diet of 2, 000 calories. Look for the serving size and sodium on the Nutrition Facts label. A label showing % Daily Value (%DV) of 5% or less per serving is considered low in sodium. What is medical nutrition therapy? Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is nutrition counseling from a registered dietitian to help meet your medical or health goals. MNT can help delay CKD progression, prevent or treat complications, and improve your quality of life. Medicare and insurance coverage for MNT If you are enrolled in Medicare and have CKD, Medicare will cover MNT services External link. You will need a written referral from a doctor, and the MNT must be provided by a registered dietitian. If you have health insurance, check your insurance companys website or call customer service to find out if your insurance will pay for some or all MNT. If you dont have insurance or Medicare, ask a health care professional about the cost of a dietitians services. A health care professional may be able to connect you with organizations that can help cover the cost of nutrition counseling.

Foods to avoid if you have kidney disease are mainly those that are high in sodium, phosphorus, or both. Individual dietary choices will depend on your stage of kidney disease and blood tests. Ultimately, people with CKD need to consult with a dietitian for personalized advice. Here are some items you may want to avoid or limit: processed foods or premade meals, which tend to have added sodium canned foods with added salt opt for salt-free or rinse them before using them large portions of protein foods, such as meat or dairy foods alcohol deli meats Learn more about which foods to avoid if you have kidney disease. The bottom line People with kidney disease have to manage their intake of phosphorus, salt, and potassium. At certain stages, they may also need to limit their protein intake. As nutritional needs and restrictions change during the course of the disease, its best to speak with a doctor or registered dietitian before making any dietary changes. They will help you work out a diet suitable for you. Suitable options may include chicken, shiitake mushrooms, cranberries, macadamia nuts, and a wide range of other tasty and nutritious foods. Diabetes and Kidney Disease: What to Eat? What to know About 1 in 3 American adults with diabetes also has chronic kidney disease (CKD). Figuring out what to eat can be a major challenge. Diabetes and CKD diets share many of the same foods, but there are some important differences. Read on for the basics. Woman eating edamame Diabetes diet A healthy diabetes diet looks pretty much like a healthy diet for anyone. Eat lots of fruits, veggies, healthy fats, and lean protein. Eat less salt, sugar, and foods high in refined carbs (cookies, crackers, and soda, just to name a few). Your individual carb goal is based on your age, activity level, any medicines you take, and other factors. Following your meal plan will help keep blood sugar levels in your target range. This will also prevent more damage to your kidneys. Kidney diet With a CKD diet, youll avoid or limit certain foods to protect your kidneys. Youll include other foods to give you energy and keep you nourished. Your specific diet will depend on whether youre in early-stage or late-stage CKD or if youre on dialysis. Foods to limit Eat less salt/sodium. Over time, your kidneys lose the ability to control your sodium-water balance. Less sodium in your diet will help lower blood pressure. It will also decrease fluid buildup in your body, which is common in kidney disease. Focus on fresh, homemade food to better control the amount of sodium in your food. Eat only small amounts of restaurant food and packaged food, which usually have lots of sodium. Look for low sodium (5% or less) on food labels. In a week or two, youll get used to less salt in your food. Add flavor with herbs, spices, mustard, and flavored vinegars.

Eat only small amounts of restaurant food and packaged food, which usually have lots of sodium. Look for low sodium (5% or less) on food labels. In a week or two, youll get used to less salt in your food. Add flavor with herbs, spices, mustard, and flavored vinegars. But dont use salt substitutes unless your doctor or dietitian says you can. Many are very high in potassium, which you may need to limit. Depending on your kidney disease stage, you may also need to reduce the potassium, phosphorus, and protein in your diet. Many foods that are part of a typical healthy diet may not be right for a CKD diet. Phosphorus is a mineral that keeps your bones strong and other parts of your body healthy. Your kidneys cant remove extra phosphorus from your blood very well. Too much weakens bones and can damage your blood vessels, eyes, and heart. Meat, dairy, beans, nuts, whole-grain bread, and dark-colored sodas are high in phosphorus. Phosphorus is also added to lots of packaged foods. The right level of potassium keeps your nerves and muscles working well. With CKD, too much potassium can build up in your blood and cause serious heart problems. Oranges, potatoes, tomatoes, whole-grain bread, and many other foods are high in potassium. Apples, carrots, and white bread are lower in potassium. Your doctor may prescribe a potassium binder, a medicine that helps your body get rid of extra potassium. Eat the right amount of protein. More protein than you need makes your kidneys work harder and may make CKD worse. But too little isnt healthy either. Both animal and plant foods have protein. Your dietitian can help you figure out the right combination and amount of protein to eat. Say no to herbal supplements Herbal supplements arent safe if you have kidney disease. Some can hurt your kidneys and even make kidney disease worse. Some vitamins can cause kidney problems too and should also be avoided. Always talk to your doctor before taking any supplements or vitamins. Diabetes and CKD foods Below are just a few examples of foods a person with both diabetes and CKD can eat. Your dietitian can give you more suggestions and help you find recipes for tasty meals: Fruits: berries, grapes, cherries, apples, plums Veggies: cauliflower, onions, eggplant, turnips Proteins: lean meats (poultry, fish), eggs, unsalted seafood Carbs: white bread, bagels, sandwich buns, unsalted crackers, pasta Drinks: water, clear diet sodas, unsweetened tea Heres one way your CKD diet and diabetes diet can work together. If you drink orange juice to treat low blood sugar, switch to kidney-friendly apple or grape juice. Youll get the same blood-sugar boost with a lot less potassium. Late-stage CKD Your nutrition needs will change with late-stage CKD. If youre on dialysis, you may need to eat more, especially more protein. Your appetite can change because food tastes different. Dialysis filters your blood like kidneys do, but it doesnt work as well as healthy kidneys.

Late-stage CKD Your nutrition needs will change with late-stage CKD. If youre on dialysis, you may need to eat more, especially more protein. Your appetite can change because food tastes different. Dialysis filters your blood like kidneys do, but it doesnt work as well as healthy kidneys. Fluid can build up in your body between treatments. You may need to limit how much fluid you drink. Youll need to watch for swelling around your eyes or in your legs, arms, or belly. Your blood sugar levels can actually get better with late-stage CKD. This may happen because of changes in how your body uses insulin. But when youre on dialysis, your blood sugar can increase. This is because the fluid used to filter your blood is high in glucose (sugar). Your need for insulin and other diabetes medicines will be hard to predict, so your doctor will monitor you closely. When you have kidney disease, it is important to watch what you eat and drink because your kidneys cannot remove waste products as well as they should. A kidney-friendly eating plan can help you stay healthier and slow down damage to your kidneys. This webpage is for people who have Stages 1 to 4 of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and are not on dialysis. Everyone is different and has different nutritional needs. Use this information as a guide. Work with a dietitian to create a kidney-friendly eating plan that is right for you. What is a kidney-friendly eating plan? A kidney-friendly eating plan is a way of eating that helps you stay healthy and can slow down damage to your kidneys. It includes foods that are easy on your kidneys and limits other foods and fluids so certain minerals in those foods, like potassium, do not build up to high levels in your body. How can I create a kidney-friendly eating plan that is right for me? Ask your doctor to refer you to a dietitian (someone with special training in food and nutrition to know which foods are right for people with kidney disease). You can talk to a dietitian about the foods you enjoy or any special requirements you have (for example, you are vegetarian or have food allergies) and they will help you create a kidney-friendly eating plan that is right for you and includes the foods you enjoy. Always talk to a dietitian before increasing or decreasing your daily intake of certain foods or nutrients. Medicare and many private insurance plans pay for a certain number of visits with a dietitian each year. Call your insurance company to ask if your plan covers medical nutrition therapy (MNT) with a dietitian. MNT is an approach to treat kidney disease through a tailored nutrition plan. As part of MNT, a dietitian will review your current eating habits, create a healthy eating plan, that includes your preferences, and help you overcome eating challenges.

MNT is an approach to treat kidney disease through a tailored nutrition plan. As part of MNT, a dietitian will review your current eating habits, create a healthy eating plan, that includes your preferences, and help you overcome eating challenges. Learn more about working with a dietitian to create and following a kidney-friendly eating plan Why is a kidney-friendly eating plan important? A kidney-friendly eating plan helps you manage your kidney disease and slow down damage to your kidneys. It does this by preventing certain minerals from building up in your body, which is important because your kidneys do not work as well to remove waste products from your body. A kidney-friendly eating plan can also help prevent other serious health problems and controls high blood pressure and diabetes, which can prevent kidney disease from getting worse. It also ensures that you get the right balance of nutrients to help you: Have energy to do your daily tasks Prevent infection Build muscle Stay at a healthy weight How can I follow a kidney-friendly eating plan? Your kidney-friendly eating plan may change over time but will always give you the right amount of key nutrients. Protein: One of the nutrients that gives you energy. Your body needs protein to grow, build muscles, heal and stay healthy. Fat: Fat is another one of the nutrients that gives you energy. Your body needs fat to carry out many jobs, such as using vitamins from your food and keep your body at the right temperature. Carbohydrates or carbs: Your bodys main source of energy. Your body can more easily convert carbs into energy than protein and fat. Work with your dietitian to follow the steps below for a kidney-friendly eating plan. Eat the right amount and the right types of protein Having too little protein can cause your skin, hair and nails to be weak. But having too much protein can make your kidneys work harder and cause more damage. This happens because when your body uses protein, it makes waste products that your kidneys must filter. To stay healthy and help you feel your best, you may need to adjust how much protein you eat. The amount of protein you should eat depends on your body size, activity level and health. Your doctor and dietitian may have you limit protein or change the type of protein you eat. For example, you may need to eat more lean proteins, which are foods that are high in protein and low in fat, such as whole eggs and skinless chicken and turkey. Ask your doctor and dietitian how much protein you should eat and what the best types of protein are for you. Choose the right types of fat Fat gives you energy and helps you use some of the vitamins in your food. You need some fat in your eating plan to stay healthy. Too much fat can lead to weight gain and heart disease.

Choose the right types of fat Fat gives you energy and helps you use some of the vitamins in your food. You need some fat in your eating plan to stay healthy. Too much fat can lead to weight gain and heart disease. Limit fat in your meal plan, and choose healthier fats when you can, such as olive oil. Choosing the right types of fat is also part of a heart-healthy eating plan called DASH. Choose whole grain carbohydrates Eating too many carbs can lead to weight gain. When you have kidney disease, it is best to choose whole grains and healthy carbs such as fruits and vegetables. Unhealthy carbs include sugar, honey, hard candies, soft drinks and other sugary drinks. If you have diabetes, you may also need to carefully track how many carbs you take in. Your dietitian can help you learn more about the carbs in your eating plan and how they affect your blood sugar. The ketogenic diet or keto diet is a type of low-carb diet that focuses on eating very low carbs, high fats and moderate protein amounts, so your body uses stored fat for energy instead of carbs. This diet may not be a healthy option for you because it limits your options, and you may miss out on some key nutrients. If you have questions about a specific diet, ask your dietitian. Eat the right amount of calories Calories are like fuel and give your body energy. Calories come from the protein, fat and carbs in your food and fluid plan. How many calories you need depends on your age, gender, body size and activity level. You may need to adjust how many calories you eat to stay at a healthy weight. Some people will need to limit the calories they eat. Others may need to have more calories. Your doctor and dietitian can help you figure out how many calories you should have each day. Choose and prepare foods with less sodium (salt) Sodium (salt) is a mineral found in almost all foods. It has many important roles in the way your body works. The amount of sodium found naturally in foods is enough to keep a healthy level in your body. But eating packaged foods and adding salt to foods can lead to eating too much sodium. Too much sodium can make you thirsty and make your body hold onto water, which can lead to swelling and raise your blood pressure. This can damage your kidneys more and make your heart work harder. One of the best things you can do is to limit how much sodium you eat. Here are some tips to limit sodium: Use herbs and spices for flavor while cooking. Do not add salt to your food when cooking or eating. Choose fresh or frozen vegetables instead of canned vegetables. If you use canned vegetables, drain and rinse them to remove extra salt.

Here are some tips to limit sodium: Use herbs and spices for flavor while cooking. Do not add salt to your food when cooking or eating. Choose fresh or frozen vegetables instead of canned vegetables. If you use canned vegetables, drain and rinse them to remove extra salt. When eating out, ask your server to have the chef not add salt to your dish. Work with your dietitian to find foods that are low in sodium. Healthy eating can look different depending on your stage of kidney disease. Learn more about healthy eating for your specific stage: Stages 1 and 2 Stages 3, 4 and 5 (not on dialysis) Kidney failure (on dialysis) Kidney transplant Find delicious kidney-friendly recipes Kidney Kitchen is home to hundreds of kidney-friendly recipes that cover a wide variety of tastes, cuisines and dietary preferen Start cooking How to control portion sizes? Good portion control or watching how much you eat is important in a kidney-friendly eating plan, because you may need to limit how much of certain things you eat and drink. To help control your portion sizes: Read the nutrition label to learn the serving size and how much of each nutrient is in one serving. Many packages have more than one serving. For example, a 20-ounce bottle of soda is two-and-a-half servings. For foods that do not have nutrition labels, such as fruits and vegetables, ask your dietitian for a list of nutrition facts to measure the right portions. Eat slowly and stop eating when you are full. It takes about 20 minutes for your stomach to tell your brain that you are full. If you eat too quickly, you may eat more than you need. Avoid eating while doing something else, such as watching TV or driving. When you are distracted, you may not realize how much you have eaten. Will my kidney-friendly eating plan change based on my stage of CKD? Yes, how strict your eating plan should be depends on your stage of kidney disease. When you are in the early stages of CKD (Stages 1 and 2), you will have less limits on what you can eat. As your kidney disease gets worse (Stages 3, 4 and 5), your doctor may recommend that you limit: Potassium: A mineral found in foods that your body needs to make your muscles work. Phosphorus: A mineral found in foods that works with calcium and vitamin D to keep your bones healthy. Fluids: Anything that turns to liquid at room temperature, not just water. Choose foods with the right amount of potassium When your kidneys are not working well, your potassium level may be too high or too low. Having too much or too little potassium can cause muscle cramps, problems with the way your heart beats and muscle weakness. If you have kidney disease, your doctor or dietitian may tell you to lower the amount of potassium in your eating plan.

Having too much or too little potassium can cause muscle cramps, problems with the way your heart beats and muscle weakness. If you have kidney disease, your doctor or dietitian may tell you to lower the amount of potassium in your eating plan. Use the lists below to learn about foods that are low or high in potassium. Foods low in potassium Apples, cranberries, grapes, pineapples and strawberries Cauliflower, onions, peppers, radishes, summer squash and lettuce Pita, tortillas and white breads Beef and chicken White rice Foods high in potassium Avocados, bananas, melons, oranges, prunes and raisins Artichokes, winter squash, plantains, spinach, potatoes and tomatoes Bran products and granola Beans (baked, black, pinto, etc. ) Brown or wild rice Limit phosphorus Healthy kidneys keep the right amount of phosphorus in your body. When your kidneys are not working well, phosphorus can build up in your blood. Too much phosphorus in your blood can lead to weak bones that break easily. Ask your doctor and dietitian if you need to limit phosphorus. They may also prescribe a medicine called a phosphate binder, which prevents your body from absorbing phosphorus from foods you eat. Use the lists below to learn how to replace high phosphorus foods with low phosphorus alternatives. Eat these low phosphorus foods Italian, French or sourdough bread Corn or rice cereals and cream of wheat Unsalted popcorn Some light-colored sodas and lemonade Avoid these high phosphorus foods Whole-grain bread Bran cereals and oatmeal Nuts and sunflower seeds Dark-colored colas Limit fluid When you have kidney disease, you may need to limit water and fluids. This is because damaged kidneys do not get rid of extra fluid as well as they should. Too much fluid in your body can cause high blood pressure, swelling and heart failure. To limit fluids, you will need to cut back on how much you drink and limit eating some foods that contain a lot of water, such as soups, ice cream, gelatin and many fruits and vegetables. If you need to limit fluids, here are some tips: Measure your fluids Drink from small cups to help you keep track of how much you had to drink Limit sodium (salt) to help you feel less thirsty When you feel thirsty: Chew gum Rinse your mouth with water and spit it out Suck on a piece of ice, mints or sugar-free hard candy Will my eating plan be different if I have diabetes? If you have diabetes, you need to control your blood sugar to prevent more damage to your kidneys. Your doctor and dietitian can help you create an eating plan that helps you control your blood sugar, while also limiting sodium, phosphorus, potassium and fluids. You can also ask your doctor to refer you to a diabetes educator who can work with you to better manage your diabetes. Will I get enough vitamins on a kidney-friendly eating plan? Your doctor and dietitian can help you find vitamins that are right for you.

You can also ask your doctor to refer you to a diabetes educator who can work with you to better manage your diabetes. Will I get enough vitamins on a kidney-friendly eating plan? Your doctor and dietitian can help you find vitamins that are right for you. To help you get the right amounts of vitamins and minerals, your dietitian may suggest you take: A special supplement made for people with kidney disease. A special kind of vitamin D, folic acid or iron pill, to help prevent some common side effects of kidney disease, such as bone disease and anemia. Regular multi-vitamins may not be healthy for you if you have kidney disease. Tell your doctor and dietitian about any vitamins, supplements or over-the-counter medicines you are taking. Some can cause more damage to your kidneys or cause other health problems. Healthy eating for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stages 1 to 3 What is CKD Chronic Kidney disease is a long term condition where the kidneys do not work well. It does not usually cause symptoms until later stages. CKD is normally found at earlier stages by blood and urine tests. Your GP can tell you what stage of kidney disease you have. This information is for people who have early-stage CKD. If you have late CKD you will see a specialist kidney (nephrology) team with a kidney Dietitian. More information about CKD can be found here: How does a healthy diet help my kidneys? Healthy eating is good for everyone. Some aspects are especially important for people with early-stage CKD. One of our kidneys jobs is to get rid of the waste products from food breakdown. When you have CKD, your kidneys are not able to do this well. A healthy diet makes less waste and puts less stress on the kidneys. Healthy eating can help manage diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure. Controlling these conditions can help protect the kidneys too. The information in this leaflet is suitable for you if you are living with diabetes, obesity or high blood pressure. Read more to find out how to eat well for your kidneys and overall health. What is a healthy diet? A healthy diet has a good balance of different foods and nutrients each day to keep you healthy and well. Healthy eating is not about restricting your intake. It is about choosing a variety of different foods each day; in the amounts you need to keep you well. The Eatwell Guide helps to explain what a healthy diet looks like. You can find more information about the Eatwell Guide here: Eat more of these: Fruit and vegetables are a key part of healthy eating. They provide vitamins, minerals and fibre to keep you and your kidneys well. Aim to enjoy 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day, or more if you can. Choose a variety to ensure you get different vitamins. This can be from fresh, frozen, dried or canned fruit and vegetables.

They provide vitamins, minerals and fibre to keep you and your kidneys well. Aim to enjoy 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day, or more if you can. Choose a variety to ensure you get different vitamins. This can be from fresh, frozen, dried or canned fruit and vegetables. One portion is approximately one handful Starchy foods like bread, potatoes, pasta, rice and other grains are part of a healthy diet. These foods are a key source of energy for the body. If you can, choose wholegrain products like wholemeal bread, brown rice, wholewheat pasta, oats and potatoes with skins on to ensure you get more fibre, and vitamins. Beans, lentils, chickpeas and other pulses provide protein. They are also high in fibre and low in less healthy fats. Regularly replacing some of your meat with these pulses may help to slow the loss of kidney function. Eat some of these: Animal protein foods like fish, eggs, meat, milk, yoghurt and cheese provide a range of vitamins and minerals. They can be part of a healthy diet when eaten in moderate amounts. However, it is best to eat more plant sources of protein such as lentils, pulses, legumes, tofu or nuts and less meat, especially red meat. Oily fish like salmon, mackerel or sardines provide a source of omega-3 (a healthy fat). Enjoy one portion of fish per week. Or you can obtain Omega-3 from rapeseed oil, walnuts or seeds (hemp, chia or flax/linseeds). Dairy foods provide protein, calcium, B vitamins and iodine. It is best to go for lower fat and lower sugar versions (for example natural yoghurt) most of the time. If you use a plant-based-dairy alternative, choose one that is fortified with calcium. It is best to limit plant milks and dairy alternatives (such as yoghurt) to 300 ml (half a pint) a day if they have phosphate additives listed in the ingredients. Eat small amounts of these: We need fats and oils in small amounts. It is best to choose fats like olive oil, nut, seed or healthy vegetable oils, such as rape seed oil. Limit less healthy fats such as coconut and palm oil, butter, lard and ghee. If you can, it is best to keep processed foods to a minimum. Foods that are pre-packed, or have added fat, salt, sugar and / or additives are processed. Ready meals are processed. This also includes meats or fish that are salted, cured, smoked, coated, breaded or battered. Eat less of these: Food or drinks that are high in less healthy fats, salt and sugar are best eaten only occasionally. These items include chocolate, cakes, biscuits, pastry, crisps, fried chips and sugary drinks. Try to keep portion sizes small. Note: it is advisable to avoid star fruit. Star fruit has a toxin that can build-up in the body and become harmful to those with kidney disease. Reducing salt: Reducing salt is helpful for everyone with CKD. Most of us eat more salt than we should.

Note: it is advisable to avoid star fruit. Star fruit has a toxin that can build-up in the body and become harmful to those with kidney disease. Reducing salt: Reducing salt is helpful for everyone with CKD. Most of us eat more salt than we should. Salt is added to many foods before we buy them as part of the food manufacturing process, Eating salt and salty foods increases your blood pressure. Limiting the amount of salty foods, you can eat can help keep blood pressure under control and reduce further damage to kidneys. Salt can also make you thirsty and makes fluid retention worse. It is recommended to have less than 5g (one teaspoon) salt per day. Most of this salt is likely to be naturally occurring in the foods you eat. Your taste buds will adapt to less salt, but this may take about 3 weeks. Tips to reduce salt include: If you can, limit processed or convenience foods and takeaways. If you do eat these, check labels and choose versions that are lower in salt. Cook meals from scratch wherever possible Try not to add salt in cooking or at the table. This includes all types of salt, e. g. Lo Salt or other lower sodium salts, rock salt, sea salt, Himalayan pink salt, garlic and kosher salts etc. Salt substitutes such as Lo-salt or other low sodium salts contain a lot of potassium and are not always suitable for people with kidney disease. Use reduced salt stock cubes in your cooking, rather than standard cubes. These are available in most supermarkets. Flavour food using a variety of fresh or dried herbs, spices, garlic, ginger, onions, vinegars, lemon or lime juice. Be careful with seasoning mixes as these can contain a lot of salt. Understanding food labels: Reading and understanding food labels can look complicated and time consuming, but gets easier with practice. If you shop online, this information is available on the supermarket websites. Having less salt: Some foods may be labelled reduced salt but could still be quite high in salt. Remember to look at the Traffic Light Symbol on the front of the packaging. It will look something like this. Choose foods that are green or amber for salt. Have less of these that are coloured red. If there is no traffic light symbol, check the nutritional information on the back of food packaging. This may tell you the amount of salt per 100 g of the product, or per portion. If the label provides the salt per 100 g, compare with the table below Per 100g Low Medium High Salt 0-0. 3g 0. 3-1. 5g More than 1. 5g If the food label only says how much is in a portion, consider how much of that food you are planning to eat. The manufacturers portion size might be different from yours. Check the portion size on the label and compare it to your own.

5g More than 1. 5g If the food label only says how much is in a portion, consider how much of that food you are planning to eat. The manufacturers portion size might be different from yours. Check the portion size on the label and compare it to your own. Picking a larger or smaller portion can have a big impact on the amount of salt you consume. Phosphate: Avoiding phosphate additives in your food can be helpful if you have CKD. Too much phosphate from additives can be harmful to your heart, kidneys, and bones. Many processed foods contain phosphate additives. The good news is you can usually find a similar product without these additives. You can check in the ingredients list on the label. Most people find the easiest way is to look for phosp as part of a word on the list. However, sometimes a label only shows E numbers. Here is a list of E numbers to watch out for. Some people find it useful to carry a credit card-sized list while shopping, or you can save the numbers on your phone. Cooking from scratch more often will help to reduce the amount of additives you eat. Note: You can enjoy foods that naturally contain phosphates unless your kidney care team tells you otherwise. Our bodies dont absorb natural phosphates as easily as phosphate additives. If you need guidance on your diet, a kidney Dietitian will assist you in choosing the right foods, including those without additives. E338 Phosphoric acid E339 Sodium phosphates E340 Potassium phosphates E341 Calcium phosphates E343 Magnesium phosphates E450 Diphosphates E451 Triphosphates E452 Polyphosphates Special Diets Many people with CKD wont need to follow special diets. However, those with more advanced CKD may be advised to make changes to their potassium, phosphates, protein, or fluid intake. The advice you receive about limiting these nutrients will depend on your CKD stage, blood results, medications, and how you like to eat. If youve been told to make dietary changes, a kidney Dietitian can help you create a healthy, balanced and enjoyable diet while taking your condition in to account. You should not restrict your diet unless you have been advised by your Kidney Doctor or Dietitian to do so. Poor Appetite If youre in the advanced stages of CKD and find yourself often not feeling hungry, its a good idea to speak with to a kidney Dietitian. They can provide assistance for issues like not wanting to eat much, changes in taste, feeling sick, vomiting or losing weight without meaning to. Vitamin and mineral supplements If you are eating well and enjoying a varied diet, there is no need to take a vitamin and mineral supplement. If you do want to take a supplement or herbal remedy, discuss this with your kidney Doctor first. They can help to ensure it is safe to take. Other lifestyle guidance Alcohol General guidance is to try not to exceed 14 units of alcohol each week.

If you do want to take a supplement or herbal remedy, discuss this with your kidney Doctor first. They can help to ensure it is safe to take. Other lifestyle guidance Alcohol General guidance is to try not to exceed 14 units of alcohol each week. If you do drink, spread your drinking evenly over three or more days and have several alcohol-free days per week (always check alcohol consumption is safe with your medication). Exercise Staying active is key to staying healthy. Exercise not only strengthens your bones and muscles but also helps you manage your weight, blood pressure, and diabetes. Aim to do 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity each week. For example, you can take a 30-minute walk five times a week. However, any exercise is better than none at all. Start slowly and gradually increase your activity based on your current fitness. Smoking If you currently smoke, then it is advisable to stop. There are special services to help you stop smoking. You can find out more about this at your GP practice. Summary Enjoy a varied healthy diet, rich in vegetables, fruits, wholegrains and pulses each day. Eat regularly and try not to miss meals. Eat less salt, foods that are high in salt and processed foods. Check food labels to cut down your intake of phosphate additives. Good control of blood pressure, diabetes and keeping to a wealthy weight are helpful to slow the progression of your CKD down. Discuss any over the counter supplements with your kidney Doctor before taking them. Only follow a special diet for your kidneys if you have been advised to by your kidney Doctor or Dietitian.

You may need to call your insurance provider to see if your plan covers meeting with a dietitian. Are you looking for nutrition guidance? Contact a CKD dietitian in your area. CKD Kidney Dietitian Directory Nutrients to manage in chronic kidney disease People with CKD may need to control the amount or type of one or more nutrients: Sodium Potassium Phosphorus Calcium Protein Eating the right amount or type of one or more of these nutrients may help control the buildup of waste and fluid in your blood. This means your kidneys do not have to work as hard to remove the extra waste and fluid. If your kidney disease gets worse, you may need to limit other nutrients as well. Your dietitian or healthcare provider will tell you if you need to do this based on your blood test results. Sodium and your CKD Diet: How to Spice Up Your Cooking Healthy kidneys control how much sodium is in your body. If your kidneys do not work well, too much sodium can cause fluid buildup, swelling, higher blood pressure, and strain on your heart. Your dietitian or healthcare provider can tell you the right amount of sodium you should have each day. Potassium Potassium is important for muscle function, including the heart muscle. Too much or too little potassium in the blood can be very dangerous. The amount of potassium you need is based on how well your kidneys are working and your medications. Your dietitian or healthcare provider can tell you about foods with potassium and the right amount for you to eat each day. Potassium from animal foods is absorbed at a higher rate than potassium from plants. Elevated blood sugars can also increase potassium levels. Some high-potassium foods include milk, meat, bananas, oranges and orange juice, cantaloupe, dried fruits, winter squash and salt substitutes. Phosphorus and Your Diet As kidney function gets lower, extra phosphorus can start building up in the blood. High phosphorus levels can cause bones to get weaker. Your dietitian or healthcare provider can tell you if you need to limit goods that are high in phosphorus. High phosphorus foods include dairy products, organ meats, colas, deli meats, and processed foods with phosphate additives. Avoid processed foods that have additives with PHOS like disodium PHOSphate. You can find these additives in the ingredients list on food labels. Calcium Foods that are good sources of calcium are often high in phosphorus. Your dietitian or healthcare provider will tell you if you need to limit calcium. Before taking any over-the-counter vitamin D or calcium supplements, talk to your healthcare provider. Protein Your body needs protein to help build muscle, repair tissue, and fight infection. Plant-based protein like beans and nuts are easier on the kidneys than animal proteins like meat and dairy products. This is because plant proteins produce less acid in the body than meat proteins. More acid in body can damage the kidneys.

Plant-based protein like beans and nuts are easier on the kidneys than animal proteins like meat and dairy products. This is because plant proteins produce less acid in the body than meat proteins. More acid in body can damage the kidneys. Having very large amounts of protein, especially in the form of unnecessary supplements, can be stressful on the kidneys. But if protein intake is too low, you can lose muscle mass, become weak, and increase the bodys acid load, so it is important to eat the right amount each day. The amount of protein you need is based on: Your weight Your age growing children and adolescents, and older people, need more protein The amount of protein in your urine, and depending on your type of kidney disease Your dietitian or healthcare provider can tell you how much protein you should eat. Fluids The Dos and Donts of Fluid Management in Chronic Kidney Disease Most people in the early stages of kidney disease do not need to limit how much fluid they drink. If you do not know your stage of kidney disease, ask your healthcare provider. If your kidney disease worsens, your dietitian or healthcare provider can let you know if you need to limit fluids and how much to drink each day. Fluids may need to be limited based on how much urine you make each day, and if fluid build-up in your body is causing swelling or stress on your heart or lungs. Fluids include any food that is liquid at room temperature such as beverages, soups, gelatin, frozen desserts, and ice. Calories Every person is different in terms of the calories they need each day. Calories are like fuel. If you dont eat enough, your body will take protein from the muscles for energy. Its important to make sure you get the right number of calories. If you dont, you may get weak and damage your kidneys. Eating the right number of calories will: Help you stay at a healthy weight Give you the energy to do your daily tasks Help your body use the protein in food to build muscle and tissues Too many calories can cause extra weight gain, which can burden the kidneys. If you are overweight, some weight loss may be helpful. If weight loss is desired or you have diabetes, you should meet with a dietitian to set up a plan based on your kidney blood tests, current food choices, and daily activities. Vitamins and Minerals Vitamins and Minerals in Chronic Kidney Disease Most people get enough vitamins and minerals to stay healthy by eating a variety of foods each day. But kidney patients may need to limit some of these foods. If so, you may need to take special vitamin or mineral supplements, but only if a dietitian or healthcare provider tells you to. Some vitamins or mineral supplements may be harmful to people with kidney disease.

But kidney patients may need to limit some of these foods. If so, you may need to take special vitamin or mineral supplements, but only if a dietitian or healthcare provider tells you to. Some vitamins or mineral supplements may be harmful to people with kidney disease. You should check with your healthcare provider before taking any medications you can buy without a prescription. Some supplements may be harmful to people with kidney disease. Over the counter vitamin and mineral supplements may contain too much phosphorous and potassium. You should also avoid taking herbal supplements. Good Fruits for Kidney Disease Managing Your CKD Diet Most fruits make for great additions to your kidney-friendly lifestyle because they are delicious, rich in fiber, low in sodium, and contain essential nutrients. The specific dietary needs for someone with chronic kidney disease (CKD) depend on multiple factors, so its important to have an idea of what fruits are good for people with kidney disease. As always, check with your doctor or dietitian about your specific needs. The Benefits of Fruits in a Kidney Disease Diet Fruits contain fiber, which has many health benefits, including improved gastrointestinal health. Additionally, people who consume high amounts of fiber tend to be at a lower risk for stroke, hypertension, coronary heart disease, obesity, and certain gastrointestinal diseases. 1 8 Great Fruits for Kidney Disease Diets Every fruit has a special set of qualitiesthey look and taste unique and offer different nutritional benefits. Understanding what each type of fruit provides will help you plan your kidney-friendly meals. Note that portion size is key for a kidney-friendly diet and, in general, a serving of fruit is equal to about one-half cup of raw fruit. Here are 8 tasty fruits to consider working into your CKD diet: Berries (all types): Low in potassium and high in antioxidants, fiber, and vitamin C, berries are low in sugar when they are consumed in modest portions, which can be beneficial for people with diabetes. Suggested recipe: Creamy Blueberry-Pecan Overnight Oatmeal Lemons and limes: Low in potassium and high in vitamin C, lemons and limes have a lower sugar content when consumed in a modest amount. They can be used in cooking instead of salt to bring out the natural flavors of a dish. Suggested recipe: Lemon Orzo Spring Salad Pineapples: Low in potassium, pineapples contain bromelain, a plant enzyme that has anti-inflammatory properties and may reduce swelling and pain in your joints. Suggested recipe: Vegan Smoothie Bowl Apples: Low in potassium and rich in fiber and vitamin C, apples also contain plant polyphenols, which are disease-fighting compounds found in plants. Suggested recipe: Apple and Cheddar with Jalapeño Slices Cherries: High in fiber and vitamin C and rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, cherries may also lessen the symptoms of gout, which can be a concern for people with CKD. 2 Grapes: High in vitamin K, grapes are also a good source of B vitamins like thiamine, riboflavin, and B6.

2 Grapes: High in vitamin K, grapes are also a good source of B vitamins like thiamine, riboflavin, and B6. B vitamins can increase your energy. Watermelon: While most melons are high in potassium, watermelon is a low-potassium fruit. It is also high in vitamins A and C, magnesium, and lycopene, a powerful antioxidant. Watermelon can contribute a significant amount of natural sugar and fluid to your diet, so stick to a 1/2 cup serving if you are watching your fluid. Suggested recipe: Watermelon, Cucumber and Feta Salad Avocados: Although high in fiber, magnesium, and healthy monounsaturated fatswhich lower LDL cholesterolavocados should only be eaten in small portions because theyre high in potassium. Suggested Recipe: Egg Salad Avocado Toast The one fruit you should avoid is star fruitit contains a neurotoxin that can cause neurological problems and toxicity for people on dialysis. 3 Managing Potassium in Fruit Fruits sometimes get a bad rap because of their potassium content, which some people living with CKD have to limit. While some fruits do have high potassium, you can still enjoy many of them in small portions so you can benefit from their nutrients while keeping your potassium level under control. Your own potassium level will determine if you need to be more careful when selecting the best fruits for you. Incorporate Tasty Fruits Regularly into Your Diet Fruits make for healthy, tasty snacks and side dishes; they are an excellent source of fiber, vitamins, antioxidants, and nutrients, and should be included in your kidney-friendly meal plan. In addition to fruits, there are a number of great food choices that will help you feel your best. As with most foods, remain aware of your portions. Knowing how to balance your fruit intake will further allow you to experience their many health benefits. Talk to your renal dietitian or nephrologist for guidance on the right balance of fruit for your current diagnosis and treatment modality.

As a result, if this fruit is a daily mainstay for people with chronic renal disease, maintaining a daily potassium intake of less than 2, 000 to 2, 500 mg may be difficult. Oranges Although oranges and orange juice are loaded with antioxidants, they are high in potassium. Oranges and orange juice should be avoided or limited on a renal diet due to their high potassium level although they are best recognized for their vitamin C content. Grapes, apples, and cranberries are all suitable replacements for oranges. Dried fruits Dried fruits are not recommended for people with renal disease or diabetes because they contain a lot of sugar and minerals such as potassium. In reality, half a cup (65 grams) of dried apricots contains about 755 milligrams of potassium. Dried fruits are strong in fast-digesting sugar, which is undesirable if you have diabetes. Avocados Avocados are high in potassium. One avocado weighing about 200 grams contains 975 mg of potassium, almost half of the daily recommended amount for people with kidney disease. Kiwi Because kiwifruit contains a lot of oxalates, people who have kidney stones should avoid eating it. Furthermore, kiwifruits are high in potassium, which may be problematic for people with renal problems. Other fruits to avoid or limit for people with kidney disease Cantaloupe Honeydew Mangos Papaya Prune juice SLIDESHOW Kidney Stones: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment See Slideshow Why should you avoid high potassium food with kidney disease? Potassium levels are not well-regulated in kidney disease. Both the disease and some medications used to treat kidney disease may cause potassium buildup in the body. Hence, potassium intake should be reduced in a kidney disease diet. Many fruits, including melons, bananas, oranges, prunes, and tomatoes, are high in potassium. Fruit punches, canned and bottled fruit juices, and iced tea are harmful in people with kidney disease. Apples, grapes, and strawberries are low-potassium foods that are considered healthy options. High vs low-potassium foods list Low-potassium foods Apples Berries Fruit cocktail Grapes Lemon Peaches Canned pears Pineapple Plums Watermelon High-potassium fruits Avocados Bananas Cantaloupe Dried fruits Honeydew Kiwi Mangos Oranges and orange juice Papaya Prune juice Further tips Instead of bananas, oranges or kiwis, choose apples, berries, or grapes. Instead of cantaloupe or honeydew, choose watermelon. Instead of nectarines, mangos, or papaya, eat peaches, plums, or pineapple. Instead of raisins or other dried fruit, use dried cranberries.

What fruits are good for stage 3 kidney disease? - Rebecca G, NJ All fruits and vegetables fit in a stage 3 CKD eating pattern. Usually, you have not been placed on a potassium restriction in stage 3. For meals its recommended that you have at least ½ your plate be vegetables and some fruits, ¼ of your plate whole grains and ¼ lean protein. For snacks: 1 small fruit with a small portion of protein (such as cheese, peanut butter, yogurt) to help keep you feeling full. Fruits are full of lots of different vitamins and minerals and eating a wide variety is important to help you get that benefit. We encourage fresh or frozen (not in syrup) fruits vs juice. By eating whole fruits, you also get the fiber which is missing in juice. It is easy to go a bit overboard with smaller fruits (grapes, tangerines, cut fruit) and juice. While you may eat too many calories when eating a larger portion of fruits, it still contains fiber and helps slow down the carbohydrate absorption vs drinking juice which doesnt have the fiber and could cause a spike in blood sugar. Also juice doesnt leave you feeling full as a piece of fruit, possibly you will end up eating something in addition which would add to your daily calorie intake. Some people need to avoid grapefruit and its juice because of medication if that is the case continue to avoid grapefruit. 10 Antioxidant Foods for the Kidney Diet Fresh, colorful and kidney-friendly fruits and vegetables arent just good; theyre good for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

10 Antioxidant Foods for the Kidney Diet Fresh, colorful and kidney-friendly fruits and vegetables arent just good; theyre good for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Powerful compounds called antioxidants found in certain foods may help protect you against other diseases such as cancer, heart disease, Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease. Antioxidants neutralize harmful molecules in your body called free radicals, the normal yet damaging byproducts created when your body produces energy, fights infection or is exposed to toxins. Antioxidant vitamins A, C and E available in supplement form can be harmful to people on dialysis, though many take a renal vitamin supplement that contains 60-100 mg of vitamin C per day as recommended by their doctor. One of the best ways to get antioxidants is through food. Dietitians use colors in fruits and vegetables to identify antioxidants, which include: Red/Purple Anthocyanins, polyphenols, resveratrol Red Lycopene Orange Beta-carotene Orange/Yellow Cryptoxanthin, flavonoids Yellow/Green Lutein, zeaxanthin Green Indoles, sulforaphanes, lutein White/Green Allyl sulphides, quercetin Here are 10 colorful, high-antioxidant foods for the kidney diet. 1. Cranberries Cranberries add a distinctive zing to sweet breads, muffins and other recipes like Easy Cranberry Salad. Enjoy dried cranberries sprinkled on a salad or on their own as a snack. You can also drink cranberry juice or cranberry juice cocktail. 1/2 cup serving of raw cranberries 1 mg sodium, 40 mg potassium, 6 mg phosphorus 1/2 cup serving cranberry juice cocktail 3 mg sodium, 22 mg potassium, 3 mg phosphorus 1/2 cup serving dried cranberries 2 mg sodium, 24 mg potassium and 5 mg phosphorus 2. Plums Black plums are higher in antioxidants than red. Look for plums that have a fairly firm to slightly soft feel. Pit and freeze plums and add them to smoothies, purÃe them for Quick Fruit Sorbet or try Old-Fashioned Plum Cake. 1 medium plum 0 mg sodium, 104 mg potassium, 11 mg phosphorus 3. Blueberries Blueberries are classic additions to pancakes and blueberry muffins. Buy them frozen to use in smoothies or in a Blueberry Peach Crisp. When theyre in season, enjoy a bowl of fresh blueberries. 1/2 cup serving fresh blueberries 4 mg sodium, 65 mg potassium, 7 mg phosphorus 4. Blackberries/raspberries Sprinkle fresh berries on your cereal or oatmeal, use frozen ones in smoothies or bake them into pies such as More Mommas Blackberry Mountain Pie. Use berries in unexpected ways to bring out the flavor of meats, including this recipe for Raspberry Wings. 1/2 cup serving blackberries 1 mg sodium, 117 mg potassium, 16 mg phosphorus 1/2 cup serving raspberries 0 mg sodium, 93 mg potassium, 17 mg phosphorus 5. Garlic This tiny antioxidant powerhouse is available in fresh, bottled, minced or powdered form to use in Garlic Chicken with Balsamic Vinegar or another savory dish. Roasting a head of garlic mellows its flavor and makes a soft, delicious spread for bread. 1 clove garlic 1 mg sodium, 12 mg potassium, 4 mg phosphorus 6.

Whats more, if chips are made from potatoes, theyll contain a significant amount of potassium as well (47Trusted Source). Summary Pretzels, chips, and crackers are easily consumed in large portions and tend to contain high amounts of salt. Additionally, chips made from potatoes provide a considerable amount of potassium. Kidney-friendly recipes Following a kidney-friendly diet requires limiting several foods, which can be challenging. However, there are many nutritious and delicious recipes that you can still enjoy as part of a balanced kidney diet. Here are a few tasty options available from the National Kidney Foundation: Chicken and Zucchini Quiche Pumpkin Pancakes Mexican-Style Stuffed Peppers Be sure to make adjustments as needed, depending on your specific needs and preferences. A renal dietitian can also recommend kidney-friendly recipes to help round out your diet. Summary There are many nutritious recipes available that can easily fit into a renal diet. You can also adjust recipes based on your needs and preferences. How are dietary restrictions for kidney disease determined? Your specific dietary restrictions will depend on your stage of kidney disease. For instance, people with early stages of chronic kidney disease will have different dietary restrictions than those with end-stage renal (kidney) disease or kidney failure. Those with end-stage kidney disease who require dialysis also have varying dietary restrictions. Dialysis is a type of treatment that removes extra water and filters waste (4Trusted Source). Most of those with late or end-stage kidney disease need to follow a kidney-friendly diet to avoid a buildup of certain chemicals or nutrients in the blood (5Trusted Source). In those with chronic kidney disease, the kidneys cannot adequately remove excess sodium, potassium, or phosphorus. As a result, theyre at a higher risk of elevated blood levels of these minerals (5Trusted Source). A kidney-friendly diet, or renal diet, usually limits sodium to under 2, 300 milligrams (mg) per day, as well as your potassium and phosphorus intake (5Trusted Source). The National Kidney Foundations most recent Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines dont set specific limits on potassium or phosphorus (6). Potassium and phosphorus are still a concern for people with kidney disease. Still, they should work closely with a doctor or dietitian to determine their personal limits for these nutrients, which are usually based on lab results. Damaged kidneys may also have trouble filtering the waste products of protein metabolism. Therefore, individuals with chronic kidney disease of all stages, especially stage 35, should limit the amount of protein in their diets unless theyre on dialysis (6, 7Trusted Source). However, those with end-stage kidney disease undergoing dialysis have an increased protein requirement (8Trusted Source). Frequently asked questions What foods help your kidneys work better? The best thing you can do to help your kidneys work better is to eat a well-balanced diet full of nutritious, vitamin-rich foods that are low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus (53).

Frequently asked questions What foods help your kidneys work better? The best thing you can do to help your kidneys work better is to eat a well-balanced diet full of nutritious, vitamin-rich foods that are low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus (53). Some examples include: tofu cheese thats low in phosphorus (such as goat cheese, grated parmesan, mozzarella, Monterey Jack, Swiss cheese, and Brie) milk alternatives (such as oat, soy, or rice) healthy cooking oils (such as olive oil, safflower oil, or sesame oil) fish fresh fruit (like strawberries, blueberries, apples, pomegranates) beans Is peanut butter good for the kidneys? Peanut butter is a good source of plant-based protein. Its naturally low in carbohydrates, and has plenty of fiber to aid digestion. Its a good substitute for meat in a kidney diet plan. However, its worth noting that 2 tablespoons of peanut butter also has 65 milligrams of oxalate, and high amounts of oxalate can contribute to kidney stones (54, 55). Talk with your doctor if youre prone to kidney stones, as you may want avoid or reduce your peanut butter consumption. Also, when purchasing peanut butter, be sure to look for brands that dont add extra salt and sugar. Is chocolate bad for the kidneys? Dark chocolate is rich in antioxidants and has actually been shown to reduce certain markers of inflammation in people undergoing dialysis (50Trusted Source, 51Trusted Source). Still, chocolate is high in calories and added sugar and contains some phosphorus and potassium. Therefore, its best to enjoy it in moderation as part of a well-rounded diet, especially if you have kidney disease (52Trusted Source). Are eggs bad for the kidneys? Eggs are highly nutritious and can often fit into a balanced renal diet. However, people following a low protein diet may need to moderate their intake, depending on the amount of protein that they are allotted each day (48Trusted Source). Is coffee bad for the kidneys? Enjoying the occasional cup of coffee is typically fine on a renal diet and is unlikely to affect kidney health. However, drinking 34 cups (473710 mL) daily or adding large amounts of milk, creamer, or flavored syrup may increase potassium or phosphorus levels. Additionally, drinking multiple cups is not recommended if youve been advised to restrict your fluid intake (49). The bottom line If you have kidney disease, reducing your potassium, phosphorus, and sodium intake can be an important aspect of managing the disease. The high sodium, potassium, and phosphorus foods listed above are likely best limited or avoided. Dietary restrictions and nutrient intake recommendations will vary based on the severity of your kidney damage. Following a renal diet can seem daunting and a bit restrictive at times. However, working with a healthcare professional and renal dietitian can help you design a renal diet specific to your individual needs. What foods are bad for kidneys? Renal diet Foods to avoid Other foods Summary People with kidney disease typically need to follow a diet low in sodium, protein, potassium, and phosphorus.

What foods are bad for kidneys? Renal diet Foods to avoid Other foods Summary People with kidney disease typically need to follow a diet low in sodium, protein, potassium, and phosphorus. This means limiting or avoiding foods such as avocados, brown rice, and chips. The kidneys perform many crucial functionsTrusted Source for health, including filtering waste products and excess fluid from the body and removing it through urine. They also regulate the bodys mineral balance and produce a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production. When a person has kidney disease, waste products can build up in their blood. A doctor may recommend dietary changes to help manage the condition and support kidney function. This article explains which foods to avoid or limit with kidney disease. It also provides an overview of the renal (or kidney-friendly) diet. Renal diet Bojan89/Getty Images A specialist kidney dietitian will typically work with people with kidney disease to tailor a diet to their needs. A kidney-friendly diet, also called a renal diet, may vary slightly depending on the stage of a persons kidney disease. For example, those in the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) should limit their sodium and possibly protein intake. In the later stagesTrusted Source of CKD, known as kidney failure, an individual should follow a diet that limits sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. Learn about the link between kidney disease and potassium. Foods to avoid A dietitian may ask that individuals following a renal diet avoid the following foods: 1. Canned foods Sodium, a main ingredient of salt, is a natural mineral often found in canned foods in high quantities. Manufacturers typically addTrusted Source sodium to canned items to increase shelf life and enhance taste. With CKD, the kidneys cannot eliminate excess sodium as they should. This means people with CKD should avoid or limit eating canned goods such as soup, vegetables, and beans. Choosing canned foods labeled low sodium and draining the contents can help reduce the amount of sodium a person consumes. 2. Whole wheat bread A buildup of phosphorus and potassium can causeTrusted Source problems for people with CKD. Due to the highTrusted Source content of these minerals in whole wheat bread, people with CKD should instead choose white bread. For example, one slice of whole wheat bread contains 76. 3 mgTrusted Source of phosphorus and 90 mg of potassium. White bread, on the other hand, contains 31. 6 mgTrusted Source of phosphorus and 32. 8 mg of potassium. If a person does not wish to stop eating whole wheat bread entirely, they could instead consider reducing the amount they eat. For example, they could eat just one slice with a meal rather than two. 3. Dark-colored drinks Many manufacturers of dark-colored drinks add phosphorus to their products to enhance flavor, prolong shelf life, and prevent discoloration. Phosphorus in its additive form, found in dark cola and beer, is highly absorbable by the human body and is not recommendedTrusted Source for those following a renal diet.

Dark-colored drinks Many manufacturers of dark-colored drinks add phosphorus to their products to enhance flavor, prolong shelf life, and prevent discoloration. Phosphorus in its additive form, found in dark cola and beer, is highly absorbable by the human body and is not recommendedTrusted Source for those following a renal diet. However, root beer is an exception to this as it contains no phosphorusTrusted Source. 4. Avocados While healthcare professionals generally consider avocados a beneficial addition to a persons diet, people with renal problems may wish to avoid or limit them. This is because they are high in potassium, with one avocado weighing around 200 g containing 975 mgTrusted Source of potassium. According to the National Kidney Foundation, anything that exceeds 200 mg of potassium per serving is high in potassium. If needed, a person can still include avocados in their diet, but they should drastically reduce their portion size. 5. Bananas A large banana contains 487 mgTrusted Source of potassium, meaning a person with CKD should avoid or limit eating this fruit. Many other tropical fruits also have high potassium content. Pineapples may be a suitable alternative as they contain a much smaller amountTrusted Source of potassium compared with other tropical fruits. 6. Oranges and orange juice Oranges and orange juice are a potassium-rich food and drink. A small orange contains 174 mgTrusted Source of potassium, while 250 gTrusted Source of orange juice contains as much as 441 mg of potassium. Alternative fruits that are lower in potassium include grapes, apples, and cranberries. 7. Dried fruits Dried fruits are concentrated sources of many of the nutrients found in fresh fruits. This means it can be easier to exceed recommended daily intakes from them. People following a renal diet should avoid apricots, dates, prunes, and raisins, which are all high in potassium. 8. Tomatoes Tomatoes are another high potassium fruit that a person following a renal diet should limit. For reference, a cup (245 g) of tomato sauce contains 728 mgTrusted Source of potassium. 9. Brown rice While it is nutritious, brown rice has a higherTrusted Source phosphorus and potassium content than white rice. A cup (155 g) of cooked brown rice contains 149 mgTrusted Source of phosphorus and 94. 6 mg of potassium, while a cup (186 g) of cooked white rice contains 68. 8 mgTrusted Source of phosphorus and 53. 9 mg of potassium. Bulgur, buckwheat, and couscous are also alternatives to brown rice. 10. Dairy Despite dairy and milk traditionally being promoted for bone health, for people with CKD, consuming too much can be detrimental to bone health. The reason for this is that dairy is a natural source of phosphorus and potassium. A cup (244 g) of whole milk contains 205 mgTrusted Source of phosphorus and 322 mg of potassium. Kidney damage can cause an excess of phosphorus to build up in the blood (known as hyperphosphatemia). This condition can cause the body to pull calcium from the bones, resulting in thin, weak bones.

Kidney damage can cause an excess of phosphorus to build up in the blood (known as hyperphosphatemia). This condition can cause the body to pull calcium from the bones, resulting in thin, weak bones. It is important for people following a renal diet to limit dairy products to avoid this buildup of protein waste in the blood. Coconut milk may be a favorable substitute for people with CKD based onTrusted Source its low potassium, sodium, and oxalate content. 11. Processed meats Processed meats are meats that manufacturers have salted, dried, cured, or canned. Some examples include hot dogs, bacon, and pepperoni. To improve their taste and preserve flavor, they often contain lots ofTrusted Source salt. If a person regularly eats highly processed foods, keeping their sodium intake to 2, 300 mg per day (the amount recommended by the National Kidney Foundation) may be difficult. 12. Pickles, olives, and relish Pickles, processed olives, and relish are all examples of cured or pickled foods. During the curing or pickling process, manufacturers typically add saltTrusted Source to the food. For reference, five green pickled olives (considered a small serving) equates to almost 10%Trusted Source of the daily recommended amount of sodium. 13. Bran cereals, oatmeal, and granola Many cereals contain a mixture of potassium, phosphorus, and sodium. A person following a renal diet should avoid all of these. For example, a 30 gTrusted Source serving of bran flakes contains 160 mg of potassium, 135 mg of phosphorus, and 162 mg of sodium. A 100 gTrusted Source serving of granola contains 539 mg of potassium. 14. Potatoes Potatoes, including sweet potatoes, are potassium-rich vegetables. A medium-sized baked potato contains around 610 mgTrusted Source of potassium, and a medium-sized sweet potato contains 542 mgTrusted Source of potassium. Leaching is one way a person can reduce the high potassium content in potatoes. This method essentially involves soaking or boiling potatoes in water before cooking, which, according to older research, reduces the original potassium content by at least 50%Trusted Source. 15. Processed foods Processed foods include pizza, instant noodles, and convenience meals designed for the microwave. These foods typically contain high levels of salt, sugar, and fat. As mentioned above, the National Kidney Foundation recommends keeping sodium intake to 2, 300 mg per day. This may prove difficult if a person is eating highly processed foods regularly. 16. Pretzels, chips, and crackers Foods such as pretzels, chips, and crackers are typically high in sodium and lacking in nutrients. Because chips come from potatoes, they are also high in potassium. A small bag of potato chips contains around 148 mgTrusted Source of sodium and 336 mg of potassium, and 60 g of pretzels contain roughly 744 mgTrusted Source of sodium and 134 mg of potassium. The portion sizes of these snacks can often lead to greater salt intake than intended. 17.

Swiss chard, spinach, and beet greens There are many green, leafy vegetables that people following a renal diet may need to avoid or limit due to their high potassium content. This is the case for Swiss chard, spinach, and beet greens. For example, a cup of raw Swiss chard contains 136 mgTrusted Source of potassium. As with spinach, this vegetable shrinks when boiled, meaning a person may eat more than they would raw. A person with CKD should consider this as it will, in turn, increase their intake of potassium. Kidney-friendly foods Although an individual with CKD must adapt their diet, there are still many suitable options for them to try. People should choose foods with lower levels of sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. These include: Fruit: Options include apples, cranberries, grapes, pineapple, and strawberries. Vegetables: Options include cauliflower, lettuce, onions, peppers, and radishes. Baked goods: Options include pita, tortillas, and sourdough bread. Protein: Options include beef and chicken. Carbohydrates: Options include white rice and unsalted popcorn. Learn about other foods that are good for the kidneys. Summary If an individual has CKD, doctors typically recommend reducing their intake of potassium, phosphorus, and sodium to help manage the condition. The dietary restrictions depend on the stage of the disease. Although there is a long list of foods that are best to avoid on a renal diet, there is also a wide range of foods that people can eat without affecting their kidney health. An individual may work with a renal dietitian to find the most suitable diet for them. When you have kidney problems, diet becomes more important than ever. Our kidneys remove toxins from our bodies. When you have chronic kidney disease (CKD), your bodys ability to remove waste is compromised. Making conscious food choices and having a well-balanced diet becomes an important part in managing your disease progression. Ms Lynette Goh, Principal Dietitian, and Ms Ng Su Yi, Senior Dietitian at the National University Polyclinics (NUP) has answers to some of the common questions from patients with CKD. Why is diet important in managing my CKD? The kidneys work to maintain a good balance of fluids, salts and minerals in the blood. When kidneys no longer work as they used to, there is a need to change ones diet to prevent excess waste and fluids from building up in the body. A kidney-friendly diet can also help preserve kidney function or delay progression to kidney failure. What is an appropriate diet differs from person to person, and very much depends on their level of kidney function. What nutrients should I be concerned about if I have CKD? Protein, sodium and potassium are the main nutrients to watch closely. The required intake of these nutrients will differ according to the patients age, body size, physical activity levels and stage of kidney disease.

What nutrients should I be concerned about if I have CKD? Protein, sodium and potassium are the main nutrients to watch closely. The required intake of these nutrients will differ according to the patients age, body size, physical activity levels and stage of kidney disease. Since theres so much variation, the best thing to do would be to consult your dietitian for a personalised diet plan. Sodium A patient with CKD should cut down on sodium, which is commonly found in salt as well as processed and canned foods. Sodium is known to cause retention of fluids in the body. Fluid retention in the body increases blood pressure and worsens CKD. However, it should be noted that the body does need some sodium and so it cannot be cut out entirely. Potassium Potassium is generally a good mineral for most people because it helps maintain a regular heartbeat and proper functioning of the nerves and muscles in the body. However, when the kidneys are not working as well, potassium may build up to dangerous levels in the body and this can affect the proper functioning of the heart. Potassium is found in fruits and vegetables, but dont be afraid to include them in your diet. Tips on avoiding those with higher sources and preparing them in the right way can help you maintain a safe potassium level, shared Ms Goh. Try these tips to maintain a healthy potassium level: 1. Replace fruits and vegetables with high potassium content with those of low or moderate potassium content High potassium content Moderate to low potassium content Fruits Banana, melons, dates, kiwi, plums, dried fruits. Apple, pear, orange, guava, lychee, mango, rambutan, papaya, watermelon, grapes Vegetables Bitter gourd, cabbage, Chinese kale (kai lan), mustard greens (chye sim), spinach, potato, tapioca. Bean sprouts (tau geh) cabbage, French beans, hairy cucumber, lady fingers/ okra, lettuce. 2. Keep to 2 servings of fruits and 2 servings of vegetables per day Example of 1 serving of fruit Example of 1 serving of vegetables 1 small apple/orange/pear (130g), 1 slices of papaya/watermelon (130g), 10 grapes (50g) ¾ cup of cooked vegetables (100g), 100g raw non-leafy vegetables, 150g raw leafy vegetables 3. Eat whole fruits and vegetables instead of having fruit or vegetable juices, or dried fruit 4. Cut fresh vegetables into small pieces, and soak them in water for 1-2 hours prior to cooking to remove the potassium. Discard the water and rinse the vegetables before cooking. 5. Drain all juice or syrups from canned fruits and vegetables. Protein When we eat food that contains protein, the body breaks down the protein in order to absorb and use it. However, this process produces waste products, which require the kidneys to work. One misconception that CKD patients have is to cut out protein entirely, however the downside of such over-restriction is that your body does not get enough nutrients to function properly.

However, this process produces waste products, which require the kidneys to work. One misconception that CKD patients have is to cut out protein entirely, however the downside of such over-restriction is that your body does not get enough nutrients to function properly. Protein is needed for building and maintaining muscles, healing wounds, and supporting your immune system, explained Ms Ng. She added that there is no standard diet or amount prescribed to patients. Each individuals dietary needs are different and changes depending on their kidney function. Food tastes bland now that I have to limit my sodium intake. How do I add flavour to my cooking? Food will likely taste bland at first as your taste buds are not used to it. Give yourself six weeks to adjust to a lower sodium diet. You can also have fun with herbs and spices to give your food an extra boost of flavour, shared Ms Goh. When adapting to a new diet, its easier to make changes gradually. You can start by reducing salt and processed sauces by half and using more natural seasonings such as lime, lemon juice, fresh chillies, onions, garlic and ginger. Herbs such as parsley, coriander, basil, and mint and spices such as pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, cumin and curry powder may also be used to flavour food. Just remember to choose fresh foods instead of canned or processed ones which usually contain high levels of sodium. Also, always taste your food before adding more salt or sauces, and avoid adding extra salt and sauces when youre eating. I dont have time to cook but its so difficult to eat out with my diet restrictions! Any advice or tips for eating out? Eating out can be challenging as most meals are high in salt intake. Here are four simple ways to cut down on salt when eating out: When having dishes with soup, such as noodles, ask to have the dish dry (i. e. leave the soup out) as the soup often contains high levels of salt. Request your dish to be cooked with less sauce and gravy wherever possible. If you prefer spicy food, ask for fresh-cut chilli instead of sambal or other spicy sauces. Choose meals prepared with fresh vegetables and lean meat, poultry or fish instead of processed foods such as canned or processed meat (e. g. fishballs, fishcake, and sausages). Im vegetarian. How do I ensure Im getting enough protein? It is important to plan your meals instead of eating what turns up to ensure youre getting enough and the right nutrients, including protein. A good guiding principle is to consciously include plant-based protein in every meal, said Ms Ng.

Im vegetarian. How do I ensure Im getting enough protein? It is important to plan your meals instead of eating what turns up to ensure youre getting enough and the right nutrients, including protein. A good guiding principle is to consciously include plant-based protein in every meal, said Ms Ng. Good sources of plant-based protein include: Soya and soya products such as tofu, tempeh, and soya milk Meat alternatives such as non-fried soy meat and plant-based burger patties that may include soy protein, beans, and/or lentils Dried beans, peas, and lentils Grains (e. g. quinoa, brown rice and oatmeal) Nuts, nut butter (e. g. hazelnut and almond butter) and seeds (e. g. sesame and sunflower seeds) If you are lacto-ovo-vegetarian, you may also wish to consider dairy products such as low-fat milk, low-fat yoghurt, cheese, and eggs in your diet as these too are good sources of protein. Changing your diet may not be as hard as you think! Whether or not you suffer from CKD, a good diet maintains a healthy body and well-functioning kidneys. In consultation with Ms Lynette Goh, Principal Dietitian and Ms Ng Su Yi, Senior Dietitian, NUP Lifestyle Dietetics National University Polyclinics Can Kidney Patients eat fruit and vegetables Can kidney patients eat fruit and vegetables? Tips on making low potassium choices when eating fruit and vegetables. Contrary to popular belief, patients with kidney disease CAN include fruit and vegetables, even with the dreaded potassium restrictions. Fruit and vegetables are an important part of a healthy, balanced diet and provide many vitamins and minerals, fibre and taste. When your kidney function starts to decline, the potassium levels in your blood may start to increase and you may be advised to follow a low potassium diet in order to help reduce it to a safe level. Not all renal patients need to follow a low potassium diet and it is important not to restrict yourself unless you have been advised by a qualified health professional. Your renal dietician can advise you how to follow a low potassium diet while making sure your diet stays balanced, nutritious and tasty. Fruit and vegetables are a known high source of potassium, however the types chosen and how they are prepared and cooked can impact on their potassium content. Even with a potassium restriction, two portions of fruit, such as an apple and an orange and two portions of vegetables, such as two heaped tablespoons each of carrots and broccoli, are allowed daily. Avoiding known higher sources and preparing them in the right way, helps you to maintain a safe potassium level within your blood. Tips on making low potassium choices when eating fruit and vegetables: Boil potatoes and vegetables in a large amount of water. Three egg sized potatoes are a suitable portion if following a low potassium diet. Make sure they are well cooked, double boiling is NOT necessary.

ORG 3 Kidney Failure Stage 5 chronic kidney disease, also known as kidney failure, means your kidneys are functioning at less than 15% of a healthy kidney. For most, loss of kidney function is a slow process that can take many years. Since early chronic kidney disease (CKD) does not usually have any symptoms, many people learn they have CKD when their kidney function is very low. Healthy kidneys are responsible for: Removing waste products and extra fluid from the body Filtering about 190 quarts of blood to produce about two quarts of urine (pee) every 24 hours Making enzymes, called renin, that work with hormones to control blood pressure 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Releasing a hormone called erythropoietin, that tells the bone marrow (a spongy substance that is inside bones) to make more red blood cells Creating an active form of vitamin D to keep calcium at steady levels Removing excess phosphorus in the blood Keeping important chemicals well-balanced in the body When you have kidney failure, you will need either dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. DIALYSIS Dialysis (hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) is a treatment that does some of the work that is normally done by healthy kidneys. Dialysis is needed when your own kidneys can no longer take care of your bodys needs.

DIALYSIS Dialysis (hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) is a treatment that does some of the work that is normally done by healthy kidneys. Dialysis is needed when your own kidneys can no longer take care of your bodys needs. Dialysis allows your body to: Remove waste and extra water to prevent them from building up Keep a safe level of certain chemicals in your blood such as potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate Help to regulate blood pressure HEMODIALYSIS Hemodialysis is a life-saving treatment for people with kidney failure. A hemodialysis machine works as an artificial kidney by removing wastes and extra fluid from your blood. KIDNEY. ORG 5 During hemodialysis, your blood is pumped through soft tubes to a hemodialysis machine where it goes through a special filter called a dialyzer. As your blood is filtered, it is returned to your bloodstream. Only a small amount of blood is out of your body at any time. A vascular access, which is an opening made in your skin and into a blood vessel, is the way you are connected to the hemodialysis machine. A surgeon creates a vascular access during a short surgical procedure. When you have dialysis, your blood flows out of the access through soft tubes and into a hemodialysis machine. After your blood is filtered in the machine, it goes through a soft tube to the access and back into your body. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Hemodialysis can be done at a hospital, a dialysis center, or at home. Hemodialysis treatments at a dialysis center are usually done 3 times a week and each treatment takes 3 to 4 hours to complete. Home hemodialysis treatments may be performed more frequently, usually 5 to 6 days a week. You and your healthcare provider should work together to decide the best location for your hemodialysis treatment. PERITONEAL DIALYSIS There are two kinds of peritoneal dialysis (PD) -- continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). The basic treatment for CAPD and APD is the same. However, the number of treatments and the way the treatments are done make each method different. CAPD is a continuous, machine-free treatment and it is done while you go about your normal activities such as working, attending school, or traveling. With CAPD, about two quarts of cleansing fluid flows through a tube that goes into your belly and then draining the fluid through a second tube. This process is called an exchange (putting in and taking out the fluid). With CAPD, you raise the plastic bag of cleansing fluid to shoulder level, which allows the fluid to flow into your belly. When empty, the plastic bag is removed and thrown away. KIDNEY. ORG 7 When an exchange is finished, the fluid (which now has wastes removed from your blood) is drained from your belly (into another plastic bag) and thrown away. Each exchange takes about 30 to 40 minutes and is usually done three to five times in a 24-hour period while you are awake.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Each exchange takes about 30 to 40 minutes and is usually done three to five times in a 24-hour period while you are awake. Some patients like to do their exchanges at mealtimes and before going to bed. APD differs from CAPD in that a machine (cycler) delivers and then drains the cleansing fluid for you. This treatment is usually is done at night while you sleep. TRANSPLANTATION Transplantation is when a healthy kidney from a donor (living or deceased) is surgically placed inside your body. Kidney transplant surgery usually lasts 3 to 4 hours. A kidney transplant is not a cure for kidney failure, it is a treatment. 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION When you have a kidney transplant, the new kidney functions as a normal kidney. Usually, your damaged kidneys are left in place and not removed. Only one donor kidney is transplanted, and it is placed in the lower part of the abdomen. For the rest of your life, you will need to take immunosuppressant medication, which lowers the risk of your body rejecting the transplanted kidney. Side effects of immunosuppressant medication can include weight gain, acne, upset stomach, and facial hair. Long-term side effects of immunosuppressant medication include a weak immune system. CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT Conservative management focuses on your quality of life and managing symptoms without dialysis or a kidney transplant. Conservative management is also called comfort care, non-dialytic care, supportive care, or comprehensive conservative care. The goals of conservative management are to: Preserve kidney function for as long as possible Manage symptoms (nausea, loss of appetite, and depression) and other kidney-failureassociated problems, such as anemia Maintain a good quality of life for as long as possible Prepare for end-of-life care KIDNEY. ORG 9 Dialysis Care Team The dialysis care team consists of your doctor (nephrologist) or advanced practitioner, nephrology nurse, kidney dietitian, nephrology social worker, and dialysis technician. NEPHROLOGIST The team leaders in many clinics are doctors called nephrologistsor kidney doctors. They have advanced training in treating kidney disease. They are responsible for your care during dialysis treatments. Nephrologists also may take care of patients before and after a kidney transplant. ADVANCED PRACTITIONER Your team may also include advanced practitioners. nurse practitioners (NP) and physician assistants (PA) collaborate with the doctors in caring for kidney patients both in medical offices or in the dialysis unit. 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION NEPHROLOGY NURSE Nephrology nurses are registered nurses (RNs) or licensed nurses (LVNs/LPNs) with education, training, and experience in caring for people at all stages of CKD, including stage 5 or kidney failure. They follow the rules, guidelines, and regulations set forth by the State Board of Nursing and described in the State Nurse Practice Act. Medicare requires that each dialysis center have a full-time RN with experience in dialysis. The RN is responsible for nursing services and home training programs for patients. REGISTERED KIDNEY (RENAL) DIETITIAN Registered kidney dietitians can help you plan healthy meals based on your personal lab reports.

REGISTERED KIDNEY (RENAL) DIETITIAN Registered kidney dietitians can help you plan healthy meals based on your personal lab reports. Your kidney dietitian will review your monthly labs and show you how different foods can affect how you are feeling. They can also recommend the best types of supplements to prevent and treat malnutrition, bone problems, and anemia. KIDNEY. ORG 11 NEPHROLOGY SOCIAL WORKER Nephrology social workers provide emotional support as you adjust to your dialysis routine. They are also available to assist with travel arrangements so you can get to your treatments and make sure that you have access to your medications, appropriate housing, and help you to fully understand all your treatment options. PATIENT CARE AND BIOMEDICAL TECHNICIANS There are two kinds of technicians in your dialysis centerpatient care technicians (PCTs) and biomedical technicians. Both work under the guidance of the nephrology nurse or nephrologist. PCTs perform your dialysis treatment. In many dialysis centers, they are responsible for starting and ending each treatment and for monitoring you before, during, and after treatments. PCTs complete an in-depth training program. Some states require that they have state or national certification. Biomedical technicians are responsible for maintaining dialysis machines and water quality in your center. They order dialysis supplies and reprocess dialyzers for reuse. 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Adjusting to DialysisYour New Normal Getting used to the routines of dialysis will likely take some getting used to. There are a number of things you will need to learn and many new experiences to adjust to in the first few weeks. EMOTIONAL HEALTH Dialysis is a life-changing process and learning how to cope is important. Many people on dialysis say that fear and confusion are two very common feelings when they first started. Others felt odd seeing their blood going through the dialysis machine. Just remember, whatever you are feeling, there are people on your dialysis team who can answer questions and help support you when you are anxious. KIDNEY. ORG 13 Almost everyone gets past their initial fears of being on dialysis. Most say they are now doing fine and are comfortable with dialysis. Becoming more knowledgeable and more experiencedknowing what to expectoften helps a person cope better. Dialysis is not only new for youbut also for those closest to you, your family and friends will also want to support you. In addition, your loved ones may have questions about kidney failure and dialysis treatment. Its best to be honest and transparent with them. You will feel better and they will be in a better position to help and support you. Tell them when you need help with transportation, driving your kids to school, or going to doctor appointments. 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION PHYSICAL HEALTH People on dialysis are much more likely to develop heart and blood vessel disease (also called cardiovascular disease).

Tell them when you need help with transportation, driving your kids to school, or going to doctor appointments. 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION PHYSICAL HEALTH People on dialysis are much more likely to develop heart and blood vessel disease (also called cardiovascular disease). This higher risk is due to other health problems that often accompany kidney failure, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. It is very important that you do what you can to prevent or manage heart and blood vessel problems. Some of the ways to stay healthy while on dialysis include: Stay on your dialysis treatment Follow the prescribed diet as much as possible Plan out meals with a kidney dietitian Take all of your medications exactly as prescribed Exercise regularly Manage your stress Socialize with family and friends Speak to a nephrology social worker about support groups for people on dialysis Seek help to stop smoking In addition, after a dialysis treatment, you may have low blood pressure (hypotension) if too much fluid is removed from your body. Muscle cramps can also occur if too much fluid is removed or if the fluid is removed too fast. If your blood pressure drops, you may experience nausea and/or dizziness due to low blood pressure. KIDNEY. ORG 15 Nutrition Your diet is an important part of your treatment. Your kidneys cannot get rid of enough waste products and fluids from your blood so you may need to limit fluids and change certain foods in your diet. You may need to: Eat more high-protein foods Eat less high-salt, -potassium, and -phosphorus foods Change the amount of fluid you drink (including coffee, tea, water, and any food that is liquid at room temperature). Your kidney dietitian at your dialysis center will help you plan a healthy diet. 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION PROTEIN People on dialysis need to eat more protein. Protein can help keep healthy blood protein levels and improve health. Protein also helps keep your muscles strong, heal wounds faster, strengthen your immune system, and helps improve overall health. Eat a high-protein food (meat, fish, poultry, fresh pork, or eggs) at every meal, or about 810 ounces of highprotein foods every day. Here are some examples of portion sizes: 3 ounces the size of a deck of cards: a medium pork chop, a ¼ pound hamburger patty, ½ chicken breast, or a medium fish fillet 1 ounce 1 egg or ¼-cup egg substitute, ¼-cup tuna, ¼-cup ricotta cheese, 1 slice of low sodium lunchmeat, 1 tablespoon peanut butter, ½ ounce of nuts or seeds Note: Highly processed foods should be avoided because of their high phosphorus and sodium content. Whole plant-based foods such as nuts and beans can be high in phosphorus but they are less absorbed than phosphorus amounts in processed foods. POTASSIUM Potassium is a mineral that is found in dairy products and fruits and vegetables. The muscles and nerves in your body use potassium to function.

Whole plant-based foods such as nuts and beans can be high in phosphorus but they are less absorbed than phosphorus amounts in processed foods. POTASSIUM Potassium is a mineral that is found in dairy products and fruits and vegetables. The muscles and nerves in your body use potassium to function. Too much or too little potassium can prevent your heart muscle from working properly. Your kidney dietitian can let you know the appropriate amounts of potassium you should eat. KIDNEY. ORG 17 PHOSPHORUS Phosphorus is a mineral found in many foods that you eat every day. It is important for strong bones and healthy blood vessels. However, if your phosphorus levels are too high, it can cause weak, brittle bones and heart problems. SODIUM Salt is made up of sodium and chloride, and just 1 teaspoon of salt has the daily recommended amount of sodium. About 80% of the sodium is in the food we eat. Most fast foods, foods found in convenience stores, and processed foods are very high in sodium. When you have high levels of sodium in your blood, excess fluids start building up in your body. Having too much fluid in your body can increase blood pressure, and cause breathing trouble, heart damage, and higher fluid weight gains between dialysis treatments. People on dialysis are encouraged to buy snacks that are low in sodium, to cook with and use less table salt at home, and to eat fewer salty foods when out. Instead, replace salt with herbs, spices, and low-salt flavor enhancers. Also, avoid salt substitutes made with potassium. MANAGING FLUIDS Healthy kidneys remove extra fluids from the body. Dialysis also removes excess fluids that build up in your body, but not all of the excess fluids. This is the reason why people on dialysis have frequent lab tests. 18 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION The lab results let you and your dialysis team know if you should increase or limit how much fluid you consume. Its important for your dialysis team to measure your dry weight and know whether you are still urinating. Gaining large amounts of fluid weight between dialysis treatments is unhealthy. Having too much fluid in your body can cause swelling, high blood pressure, and congestive heart failure. Removing large amounts of fluid during dialysis can cause cramping, low blood pressure, headaches, and nausea. SUPPLEMENTS Typically, people on dialysis take prescription kidney vitamins to replace nutrients and minerals lost during dialysis. Some nephrologists recommend other kinds of nutritional supplements to meet individual needs. Any over-the-counter supplements you may want to take should be discussed with your dialysis team before starting. KIDNEY. ORG 19 Financial Resources EMPLOYER GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (EGHP): If you already have commercial health insurance, you can keep it. If you are no longer able to work, you may be able to keep your benefits through COBRA. MEDICARE Medicare is not just for people who are age 65 and older.

If you are no longer able to work, you may be able to keep your benefits through COBRA. MEDICARE Medicare is not just for people who are age 65 and older. The government program also helps US citizens and legal residents of all ages who need dialysis or a kidney transplant. Over 90% of Americans with kidney failure, which Medicare calls End-Stage Renal Disease or ESRD, have Medicare. If you (or your spouse or parent) have worked long enough to qualify for Medicare, it will pay most of your treatment costs, plus some or all of the costs for hospital stays, visits to doctors, and other services. 20 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION If you have insurance through your or your spouses employer (Employee Group Health Plan), you can still apply for Medicare. Please call the NKF Cares Patient Help Line toll-free at 855. NKF. CARES (855. 653. 2273) or email us at nkfcareskidney. org to learn more. When someone first enrolls in Medicare with a diagnosis of kidney failure (ESRD), Medicare coverage usually starts: On the fourth month of dialysis treatment Medicare coverage can start as early as the first month of dialysis if: You enroll in a home dialysis training program You start home dialysis training before the third month of dialysis; and are expected to finish home dialysis training and do dialysis at home. KIDNEY. ORG 21 MEDICAID Medicaid is a federal, government-sponsored insurance program, which is available to people who meet income requirements. Usually, eligibility for Medicaid benefits is the same as those used for Federal Poverty Guidelines. There are many levels of Medicaid insurance. In addition to federal Medicaid insurance, you may be eligible for additional coverage issued by your state and county. Some counties offer assistance with transportation and may help you qualify for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly called the Food Stamp Program). SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY (SSD) Usually, 20 work credits earned in the last 10 years are needed to qualify. However, younger workers may be eligible for disability benefits with fewer work credits. If you are disabled before the age of 24, you will need 6 earned credits in the three years prior to the start of your disability. If you do not have enough work credits but have a long-term or permanent disability, you may be able to qualify for Supplemental Security Insurance benefits without any earned work credits. 22 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Living Well on Dialysis Starting dialysis can affect many parts of your day-to-day life. Many people find comfort in keeping their routines as close as possible to their alreadyestablished lifestyle. Others may prefer to focus on their dialysis treatment and adjusting to their routine. And, there are also those who feel kidney transplantation is their best treatment option. There are no right or wrong feelings. Always remember, choosing to have dialysis is a personal choice and the decision is always yours. KIDNEY.

And, there are also those who feel kidney transplantation is their best treatment option. There are no right or wrong feelings. Always remember, choosing to have dialysis is a personal choice and the decision is always yours. KIDNEY. ORG 23 TRAVEL Most patients who receive dialysis can travel safely and continue their treatment while away from home. You should always consult your doctor before planning to travel. Most doctors encourage travel if your health is good. Traveling can give a big boost to your morale and sense of well-being. Many dialysis centers have a staff member who is experienced in arranging dialysis treatments away from home (transient dialysis). Some centers will help patients make travel arrangements. Ask your social worker or nephrology nurse to assist you. In addition, dialysisfinder. com is a website that has listings and contact information for dialysis centers across the US and around the world. Your Medicare and commercial insurance will likely pay the same amount as it would at your home center. Medicaid benefits usually have limited coverage outside of your home state. When you book travel, contact the agency so you know the amount of your financial responsibility. HOME HEMODIALYSIS People who are on home hemodialysis can travel but may want to make plans for in-center treatments while away. Some people prefer to travel with their machine, supplies, and portable water treatment equipment. 24 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION PERITONEAL DIALYSIS People on peritoneal dialysis (PD) should plan ahead and arrange for back-up medical care while traveling. Contact a dialysis center thats near where you will be staying and see if you could go there if you have an emergency. The center may request a copy of medical records in advance. You should always carry a copy of your records with you. EMPLOYMENT Many people who are receiving dialysis treatment can go back to work after they have gotten used to their dialysis routine. However, if your job requires a lot of physical labor (heavy lifting, digging, etc), you may be unable to continue working. You should work out your dialysis schedule with your employer. Most employers are flexible about your need for dialysis. It is also important to understand your rights under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). For example, working out your employment schedule with your dialysis schedule is a reasonable accommodation that employers are required to make under the ADA, unless they can prove it is an unnecessary hardship. Ask your nephrology social worker for more information. KIDNEY.

ORG 3 About Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition that develops when your kidneys arent working as well as they should. This means your kidneys cannot get rid of extra fluids and waste products in your blood. When the body cannot get rid of excess fluid and waste products serious problems, such as heart disease and stroke, can occur. If you have CKD and it gets worse, then the waste products and fluids continue to build up in your blood and you will probably start to feel very unwell. Its also likely you may notice other problemssymptoms may include things like high blood pressure and anemia, a condition in which there is a short supply of red blood cells in the body. Bottom lineanemia makes people feel tired and typically, they have very little energy.

Its also likely you may notice other problemssymptoms may include things like high blood pressure and anemia, a condition in which there is a short supply of red blood cells in the body. Bottom lineanemia makes people feel tired and typically, they have very little energy. CKD also increases your risk of worsening heart and blood vessel disease. CKD may progress slowly over a long time. Many people dont even know they have CKD until it is very bad. If it is found and treated early, 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION CKD may often be slowed or stopped. If it worsens, however, CKD can lead to kidney failure. People with kidney failure are coping with a very serious disease. When you have a diagnosis of kidney failurethat means your kidneys no longer work well enough to keep you alive, and you need to go on dialysis or have a kidney transplant. CKD Risk Factors Anyone can have CKDat any age. However, some people are more likely than others to develop CKD. The 2 most common CKD risk factors are diabetes and/or high blood pressure (hypertension) You may have an increased risk for developing CKD if you have obesity, over 60 years of age, have heart disease or heart failure, and/or have family members who have had CKD or kidney failure. Diabetes Diabetes (also called sugar diabetes or sugar disease) is a disease that causes your blood sugar levels to be too high. Blood sugar is your bodys main source of energy. It comes from your food and is carried in your blood to your cells. When you have diabetes, your body either doesnt produce enough insulin or doesnt use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps your body use blood sugar for energy. KIDNEY. ORG 5 DIABETES AND CKD: Diabetes damages the kidneys by making them work harder to filter blood. This can cause the kidneys to scar and lose their ability to filter waste products from the blood. High blood sugar can also damage your blood vessels in the kidneys, further reducing kidney function. In the United States, about 37 million people have diabetes, and about 1 in 3 will develop CKD. PREVENTION: There is no cure for diabetes, but it can be managed with diet, exercise, and medication. By managing your diabetes, you can lower your risk of developing CKD. If you have diabetes, it is important to have your kidneys checked regularly by a doctor. High Blood Pressure High blood pressure (hypertension) is a health problem that makes your blood pressure too high. This can hurt your kidneys over time and cause CKD. H3 HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND CKD: High blood pressure makes your kidneys work harder. This can cause scarring of the kidneys making them unable to filter blood well. High blood pressure can also damage the blood vessels in the kidneys.

This can hurt your kidneys over time and cause CKD. H3 HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND CKD: High blood pressure makes your kidneys work harder. This can cause scarring of the kidneys making them unable to filter blood well. High blood pressure can also damage the blood vessels in the kidneys. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION In the United States, about 1 in 2 adults have high blood pressure and about 1 in 5 adults with high blood pressure will develop CKD. PREVENTION: There is no cure for high blood pressure, but it can be treated. By treating your high blood pressure, you can lower your risk of developing CKD. This includes taking your medications as prescribed, eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and losing weight if you have obesity. If you have high blood pressure, it is important to have your kidneys checked regularly by a doctor. KIDNEY. ORG 7 Age As people age, kidneys are less able to filter waste products from the blood than in younger people. This is because kidneys naturally decline in function over time. AGE AND CKD: The exact cause of age-related CKD is not fully understood, but it is thought to be due to a combination of factors, including: Natural aging process: Kidneys naturally decline in function over time Pre-existing conditions: People with other health conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and heart disease or heart failure, are at an increased risk of developing CKD Exposure to toxins: Certain toxins, such as lead and mercury, can damage the kidneys and increase a persons risk of developing CKD After the age of 40, it is normal to have a decline in your kidney filtration rates. 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION PREVENTION: While you cannot prevent getting older, there are steps you can take to prevent developing CKD as you age. These are some ways to keep your kidneys as healthy as possible as you are getting older: 1. Eat less salt: Many seniors dont realize just how much salt theyre consuming on a daily basis. Eating too much salt can increase blood pressure. Salt can also increase the chances of developing kidney stones, which can hurt your kidneys. 2. Keep diabetes well-controlled: CKD is considered a secondary disease. This is because developing CKD is often the direct result of other conditions, such as diabetes. If you do not have well-managed diabetes, you may be placing a lot of strain on your kidneys. 3. Stay well-hydrated: A key purpose of the kidneys is to filter toxins out of the blood and then get rid of the wastes through your urine (pee). If you dont drink enough water every KIDNEY. ORG 9 day, your body may not be able to fully remove the wastes from your body. If you are not wellhydrated, you increase the chances that you may develop kidney stones and CKD. Its a good idea to check with your healthcare professional to see how much fluid you should drink daily. 4.

If you are not wellhydrated, you increase the chances that you may develop kidney stones and CKD. Its a good idea to check with your healthcare professional to see how much fluid you should drink daily. 4. Reduce alcohol and caffeine: The liquids you drink go through your body, pass through your kidneys, and leave your body in your urine. Drinking too much alcohol can dehydrate you and stress your kidneys, while too much caffeine can increase your blood pressure and also make your kidneys work harder. Plain water is the best liquid to drink. 5. Limit using painkillers: Be careful with pain medicine, some prescription and over-thecounter pain medicines can hurt your kidneys if you take them a lot. If you need to take pain medicine, talk to your doctor about the best ones for you. 6. Treat urinary tract infections: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are germs that spread up the urethra (a duct, or tube that lets urine pee leave your body) and into the kidneys. When germs get into your kidneys, longterm damage can happen, so its important to treat UTIs as soon as possible. If it hurts when you urinate or if your pee looks cloudy, tell a doctor so you can get better. Antibiotic therapy can stop UTIs before the infection gets to your kidneys. 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Obesity Obesity is a condition in which a person has excess body fat. There are a number of ways to measure obesity, including body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, and waist circumference: BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight, but it does not take into account factors such as muscle mass and body fat distribution. Body fat percentage is a more accurate measure of obesity than BMI. It is the percentage of body weight that is made up of fat. Waist circumference is another measure of obesity. It is the circumference of the waist at the level of the navel. A healthy waist circumference for adults ranges from under 40 inches for men and less than 35 inches for women. KIDNEY. ORG 11 Rising rates of obesity and diabetes in the United States are linked to increased risks of high blood pressure and are projected to cause an 11% to 18% surge in kidney failure by 2030. OBESITY AND CKD: Obesity is a major risk factor for CKD and it can lead to high blood pressure, which is the second leading cause of CKD. High blood pressure can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys, making it difficult for the kidneys to filter waste products from the blood. Obesity can also lead to insulin resistance, which is a condition in which the bodys cells do not respond normally to insulin (a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy). When cells are resistant to insulin, glucose builds up in the blood, which can damage the kidneys.

Obesity can also lead to insulin resistance, which is a condition in which the bodys cells do not respond normally to insulin (a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy). When cells are resistant to insulin, glucose builds up in the blood, which can damage the kidneys. PREVENTION: Obesity is a chronic disease, but it can be prevented or managed with a healthy diet, regular exercise, and a healthy weight. If you have obsity, it is important to talk to your doctor about how to lose weight and manage your risk of CKD. Heart Disease/Heart Failure Heart disease and heart failure are two major conditions that affect the heart. Heart disease is a group of conditions that damage the heart and blood vessels. 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION The most common cause of death in people with CKD is heart disease. It can cause narrowed or blocked blood vessels and lead to a heart attack. Heart failure occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs. HEART DISEASE/HEART FAILURE AND CKD: Both heart disease and heart failure are risk factors for developing CKD because both conditions can damage the kidneys. The main causes of heart disease are the same as CKD, which are diabetes and high blood pressure. If you already have CKD, you are at higher risk for developing heart disease. PREVENTION: You can help prevent heart disease by eating healthy foods, exercising, and not smoking. Its also important to keep your blood pressure and cholesterol levels in check. If you have diabetes, its important to manage it well. Taking these steps can help keep your heart healthy and strong. KIDNEY. ORG 13 Family History of CKD Some diseases are said to run in the family when more than one person has the same illness. Its true that some diseases and conditions, such as sickle cell anemia, that can affect multiple family members are caused by gene variants (also known as mutations) and can be inherited (passed down from parent to child). Since CKD affects some families more than others understanding the factors that can lead to the disease is important so that you can prevent CKD from developing. Also, if you know you are at risk for CKD, then you can take the right stepsright awayto slow down or stop the disease from getting worse. 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Social Determinants of Health People develop CKD for a number of reasons, and many factors can increase your chances of getting it. Some of these things are medical, like having high blood pressure or diabetes. However, environmental factors can also play a part. For example, breathing in dirty air can hurt our lungs, while while drinking contaminated water can cause stomach infections. In addition, there are social factors, which are things like how much money we have, our education level, and our relationships with family and friends can affect our health.

For example, breathing in dirty air can hurt our lungs, while while drinking contaminated water can cause stomach infections. In addition, there are social factors, which are things like how much money we have, our education level, and our relationships with family and friends can affect our health. Discrimination and not having access to healthcare can also increase the risk of developing CKD. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion report, Healthy People 2030, these social factors are called Social Determinants of Health, (SDoH), and they are the conditions in the environments, such as where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks. For example, if you are not able to buy healthy food at a store near you, then it will be hard for you to eat well. People who cannot eat healthy foods are more likely to develop serious health conditions like heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and CKD. KIDNEY. ORG 15 SDoH can contribute to developing serious long-term diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, lupus nephritis, and obesityall conditions that increase your risk of developing CKD. In addition, your genetics or having family members with CKD may also play a role. Its not always easy to be healthy or have a healthy lifestyle. And why is that? Wellthe short answer is that many people, especially people living, working, and learning in under-resourced communities, simply do not have access to the very basics that are needed, such as open and green spaces like parks, reliable public transportation, healthy foods to eat, and access to appropriate medical care. All of Us Research Program, National Institutes of Health, US Department of Health Human services, Social determinants of health, Twitter, June 1, 2022. Accessed May 10, 2023. twitter. com/AllofUsResearch/status/1532106012576063488 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Other reasons include not having health insurance, not having a regular doctor who knows you and your medical history, and local healthcare and policy issues, which may not provide a clear path for patients to follow. For example, if you are pregnant and unable to get good prenatal care, you can develop eclampsia (a type of high blood pressure that can occur during pregnancy and cause seizureswhich can be lifethreatening to both baby and mom) and other conditions. Eclampsia can also lead to long-term kidney damage. KIDNEY. ORG 17 CKD and Race Over 37 million adults in the United States have CKD and the people who are most at risk self-identify their race as: Black/African American Hispanic/Latino American Indian/Alaska Native Asian American Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander Biracial Multiracial The reason why some people are at higher risk of developing CKD is due to the SDoH, which has been caused by race-based social, economic, and political decisions that were made decades ago. These unfair decisions have impacted many urban and rural areas throughout the US.

These unfair decisions have impacted many urban and rural areas throughout the US. Some racial groups have a higher risk of developing CKD than othersbut their increased risk is not due to their race. 18 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION CKD Prevention While many are at risk for developing CKD, not everyone does. There are usually a number of factors that come together to cause the disease. Remember, knowing the risk factors lets you take charge of your health. If you have any risk factors, you should: Get tested for CKD with 2 simple tests: A urine (pee) test (urine albumin/creatinine ratioalso known as uACR) checks to see if you have protein in your urine. Your body needs protein. But it should only be in the blood, not your urine. A small amount of protein in your urine may mean your kidneys are not filtering your blood well enough, which can be an early sign of CKD. A blood test (estimated glomerular filtration rateeGFR) measures how well your kidneys work. Labs calculate eGFR using creatinine levels (a normal waste product in the blood), along with your age and gender. Get tested for diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. If you dont know if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease, its important for you to find out. KIDNEY. ORG 19 Stop CKD in its Tracks And, if you already have CKD, these tips can help you to slow down or stop CKD from getting worse. SEE YOUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR You take your car in for a tune-up to make sure it runs smoothly, and you should take the same care of your body. Your doctor can check for kidney disease with 2 simple tests: a urine test and a blood test. Make sure to get tested at least once a year. CONTROL BLOOD PRESSURE High blood pressure can damage your kidneys. If your blood pressure remains high, your doctor may have you take medicine. Simple tweaks to your lifestyle, such as cutting back on salt and alcohol, losing excess weight, and exercising can help keep your blood pressure in check. 20 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION MANAGE BLOOD SUGAR Blood sugar levels can be influenced by several factors, including those out of a persons control such as hormones, illness, or stress. Over time, high blood sugar levels can cause blood vessels inside the kidney to become narrow and clogged which can damage blood vessels and harm the kidneys. If you have diabetes, the best way to protect your kidneys is to manage blood sugar levels as best as possible. Your treatment plan may include changes to your diet, exercise, and medicine to lower your blood sugar levels. EAT A HEALTHY DIET A healthy diet plan, such as the Mediterranean Diet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet, can help lower blood pressure and the amount of blood lipids (fat in the blood).

EAT A HEALTHY DIET A healthy diet plan, such as the Mediterranean Diet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet, can help lower blood pressure and the amount of blood lipids (fat in the blood). KIDNEY. ORG 21 These meals include fresh fruits and vegetables, fatfree or low-fat milk and milk products, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, seeds, and nuts. They also have less salt, sugars, fats, and red meats. KEEP ACTIVE Youve heard it before! But its important to repeat exercise can help you: Maintain a healthy weight Control your blood pressure and cholesterol Build strength and endurance Lower your chances of getting diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease 22 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Many types of exercises can help you stay healthy including walking, household chores, playing a sport, or aerobic exercise (jogging, swimming, biking, climbing stairs, or hiking). STOP SMOKING Everyone is well aware of the dangers associated with smoking. Smoking causes diseases in every organ of the body, including the kidneys. If you cannot quit smoking on your own, ask your doctor about treatment options. You can also visit smokefree. gov for free help and support to stop smoking. LIMIT OVER-THE-COUNTER PAIN MEDICATIONS Over-the-counter pain medications can cause kidney damage. These medications are called NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and include products like Advil (ibuprofen) and Aleve (naproxen). They are typically used to lower fevers like when someone has the flu and to reduce aches and pains due to inflammation like when we have a minor muscle ache from playing sports. KIDNEY. ORG 23 Studies have found that NSAIDs may increase the risk of developing kidney disease. Long-term use of NSAIDs, especially at high doses, reduces the blood flow to the kidney which can cause harm to kidney tissue. Its important to know that Tylenol (acetaminophen) is not an NSAID and is an appropriate medication to use to lower fevers and reduce minor aches and pains associated with inflammation. If you are taking NSAIDs, you should ask your doctor about other medicines to manage pain, such as acetaminophen. 24 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION We Are Here To Help There are two ways to learn about the many free resources available to you: Call the National Kidney Foundation Cares Patient Help Line toll-free at 855.

ORG 3 High Blood Pressure and Chronic Kidney Disease Blood pressure is an important measurement of your health. It tells you how hard your blood is pushing against the walls of your arteries. This measurement provides valuable information about your bodys functioning. When your blood pressure is at the right level, your body gets the oxygen and nutrients it needs. Keeping your blood pressure in a healthy range is important for your overall health and well-being. High blood pressure, or hypertension, happens when blood pushes against your artery walls too hard and for too long. Many things can cause high blood pressure, including: Getting older Having a family history of high blood pressure Being overweight Not physically active Using tobacco Eating too much salt 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Drinking too much alcohol Having too much stress High blood pressure can cause problems in your body. It makes your heart work too hard, can damage your arteries, and increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and chronic kidney disease. High blood pressure and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are closely linked. Approximately 1 in 5 people have high blood pressure, and many are at risk of developing CKD due to the harmful effects of long-term high blood pressure on the kidneys. When blood pushes too hard in your kidneys, it can lead to CKD over time. ? Did you know High blood pressure is the second leading cause of CKD? Diabetes is the first. KIDNEY. ORG 5 Likewise, CKD can contribute to high blood pressure. When your kidneys dont work well, they struggle to keep salt and water balanced in your body, causing high blood pressure.

? Did you know High blood pressure is the second leading cause of CKD? Diabetes is the first. KIDNEY. ORG 5 Likewise, CKD can contribute to high blood pressure. When your kidneys dont work well, they struggle to keep salt and water balanced in your body, causing high blood pressure. Its a two-way relationship, which is why its so important both conditions are managed well. High Blood Pressure and Kidney Damage High blood pressure can hurt your kidneys in two ways: Damage blood vessels in the kidneys: High blood pressure can harm blood vessels in the kidneys, making them less able to clean your blood Makes the kidneys work too hard: High blood pressure forces the kidneys to work harder and clean more blood than normal which can cause kidney damage 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Protecting Your Kidneys When You Have High Blood Pressure Having high blood pressure doesnt mean youll definitely get CKD. There are steps you can take to lower your risk such as: Eat a healthy diet: Eat various fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit your intake of saturated and trans fats, cholesterolrich foods, and processed foods. Take prescribed medications: If your healthcare provider has prescribed cholesterol-lowering or blood pressure medications, take them as directed. These medications can help control blood pressure and reduce the strain on your kidneys. KIDNEY. ORG 7 Be active: Regular physical activity can help to maintain a healthy weight, improve blood circulation, and manage your blood pressure. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderateintensity aerobic exercise per week. Manage your weight: Maintaining a healthy weight is a key step for people with high blood pressure. If you are overweight, losing even a small amount of weight can make a big difference in your overall health. Avoid smoking: Smoking damages your blood vessels and increases the risk of developing high blood pressure and CKD. Quitting smoking can significantly improve your heart health and protect your kidneys. Drink less alcohol: Drinking too much can raise your blood pressure. 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Tests for High Blood Pressure and CKD You cant take care of something if you dont know its there. Regular testing can help keep high blood pressure and CKD under control. These are some of the common tests used to screen and monitor high blood pressure and CKD: High blood pressure: Home blood pressure machines Electrocardiograms (EKGs), which measure and record electrical activity in the heart Calculate your body mass index (BMI) by comparing your weight to your height Regularly checking the levels of fat in your blood A1C to screen and manage prediabetes and diabetes KIDNEY.

Just like hard butter can clog your arteries, high cholesterol levels, and other fats in your blood can lead to health problems and can contribute to the development of high blood pressure and cause harm to your kidneys. High blood pressure can be caused and get worse by eating an unhealthy diet high in cholesterol and unhealthy fats. These substances can build up in your blood vessels, making them narrower and less flexible. As a result, your heart has to work harder to pump blood through these narrowed vessels, leading to an increase in blood pressure. High cholesterol and fats in your blood can also harm your kidneys. When your blood vessels become damaged or narrowed, it affects the blood flow to your kidneys. This can reduce their ability to effectively filter waste and excess fluids from your blood. Over time, this can lead to kidney damage and increase the risk of developing CKD. By making healthy lifestyle choices and following your healthcare providers recommendations, you can help manage your cholesterol and fat levels, reduce your risk of high blood pressure, and safeguard the health of your kidneys. Remember, even small steps towards a healthier lifestyle can lead to big improvements in your overall well-being. 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Pregnancy, High Blood Pressure, and CKD Pregnancy can have several risks for women with CKD and high blood pressure. Here are the important things to be aware of: Pre-eclampsia: This is when a pregnant woman has high blood pressure and has signs that some of her organs, like her kidneys and liver, may not be working normally. It usually starts after the 20th week of pregnancy in women whose blood pressure had been normal. Pre-eclampsia can be dangerous for the mother and the baby if not treated. It can stop the baby from getting enough blood and oxygen. It can also cause harm to the moms kidneys and liver. KIDNEY. ORG 13 Eclampsia: This is a more severe form of preeclampsia and it can lead to seizures in the mother. If not treated, it can cause coma and even death for both the mother and the baby. Gestational hypertension: High blood pressure that starts after the 20th week of pregnancy can lead to gestational hypertension. This condition differs from pre-eclampsia because there are no signs of organ injury. Gestational hypertension may increase the likelihood of preterm birth, low birth weight, and placental abruption (when the placenta becomes detached from the uterus before delivery). Worsening kidney function: Pregnancy places extra stress on the kidneys, especially for women who already have CKD.

Gestational hypertension may increase the likelihood of preterm birth, low birth weight, and placental abruption (when the placenta becomes detached from the uterus before delivery). Worsening kidney function: Pregnancy places extra stress on the kidneys, especially for women who already have CKD. Depending on the severity of kidney function loss, additional treatments such as dialysis, may be needed. 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Acute kidney injury (AKI): A sudden loss of kidney function and women with high blood pressure and CKD are at increased risk. AKI can occur during pregnancy and poses risks to both the mother and the baby. It is important to seek medical attention immediately to treat an AKI. Premature birth: Women with CKD and high blood pressure have an increased risk of delivering their baby prematurely, before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Premature infants may require specialized care due to potential health complications. Fetal growth restriction: Having both CKD and high blood pressure during pregnancy may impact the babys growth, leading to fetal growth restriction (when a baby in the uterus does not grow to normal weight during pregnancy). This can result in a low-birthweight baby with a higher risk of having medical problems. Increased risk of cesarean delivery: Women with CKD and high blood pressure may have a higher likelihood of needing a cesarean section (C-section) for delivery. Regular checks with a healthcare provider during pregnancy can find these problems early. Your healthcare provider can then work with you to make sure your pregnancy is as safe as possible. KIDNEY. ORG 15 Key Points To Remember Understanding the link between high blood pressure and CKD is important for overall health. High blood pressure can harm your kidneys over time, leading to CKD. On the other hand, CKD can also contribute to high blood pressure. Its a two-way relationship. To prevent CKD, its necessary to manage your high blood pressure effectively. This includes making healthy lifestyle choices and following your healthcare providers advice. By reducing your salt intake, being physically active, maintaining a healthy weight, and limiting alcohol, you can lower your risk of developing CKD. Taking prescribed medications as directed is also important for controlling blood pressure and protecting your kidneys. High blood pressure damages the blood vessels in your kidneys, making it harder for them to filter waste and maintain a proper balance of fluids. Regular monitoring through recommended tests, such as EKG, BMI assessments, and lipid profiles for high blood pressure, as well as eGFR and uACR tests for CKD, can help catch issues early. Remember, small steps can make a big difference in keeping your blood pressure under control and maintaining kidney health. If you have questions, speak with your healthcare team. They know you and can answer questions about you. 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION We Are Here To Help There are two ways to learn about the many free resources available to you: Call the National Kidney Foundation Cares Patient Help Line toll-free at 855.

ORG 3 About Living Donation What is living kidney donation? Living donation is when a living person donates an organ (or part of an organ) to another person. A healthy person who has two kidneys can donate one to someone in need. A living donor may donate to someone they know, like a family member, friend, or spouse, or a stranger who theyve never met. A potential donor is someone who is thinking about donating. A recipient is someone with kidney failure who needs a kidney transplant. Who can be a living kidney donor? To donate a kidney, the person must be in good physical and mental health. Living donors must be at least 18 years old to donate at a transplant center in the United States. Some centers require a donor to be 21 or even a little older. There are some medical conditions that could prevent someone from being a living donor, including having uncontrolled high blood pressure or cancer. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION KIDNEY.

Often, doctors and loved ones are asked to make difficult treatment decisions. In some cases, the courts have been called on to make life or death decisions. This booklet contains information about decisions you can make before a medical crisis occurs. With this information, you can choose to prepare a legal document to guide loved ones, your doctor, and other healthcare providers in caring for you. Making these decisions in advance helps your loved ones, and spares them the burden of making decisions for you in a medical crisis. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION What is the Patient Self-Determination Act? The Patient Self-Determination Act, which went into effect in December 1991, gives adults with the capability to make medical decisions for themselves, the right to make decisions today about healthcare treatment they would want to receive in the future if they could not communicate what they want at that time. This law requires that hospitals, nursing homes and other health agencies give all patients information about their right to have a legal document called an advance directive. New regulations for dialysis units require that patients be informed about advance directives and the right to refuse treatment. KIDNEY. ORG 5 What is an advance directive? An advance directive is a legal document that informs doctors and healthcare providers of medical decisions you have made for future crisis care if you cannot communicate these decisions for yourself. If you have an advance directive in your medical record, your doctor and other healthcare providers can take care of you according to your wishes as stated in the advance directive. Are there different kinds of advance directives? There are two basic kinds of advance directives. A living will, the most common type of advance directive, tells your doctor or healthcare provider in writing what type of medical care you want or 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION do not want if you should become unable to make these decisions for yourself. Another type of advance directive is called a durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions or a healthcare proxy. This document allows you to name someone, such as a family member or close friend, to act on your behalf to make medical decisions for you if you are unable to make these decisions for yourself. The person who acts on your behalf is called your surrogate. It is important to ask this person if they are willing to act as your agent and to talk about which treatments you would and would not want as well as your shortand long-term goals and values. Your states laws typically allow you to have both a living will and a durable power of attorney or to combine them in a single form. You may want to speak to a lawyer or contact your state or local bar association about your states laws concerning advance directives. You may also want to speak to a social worker at your dialysis unit. Why is an advance directive important to me?

You may want to speak to a lawyer or contact your state or local bar association about your states laws concerning advance directives. You may also want to speak to a social worker at your dialysis unit. Why is an advance directive important to me? An advance directive is important for two reasons. First, it lets you make your own decisions about your future healthcare, even if you are not able to make decisions, such as whether to continue or stop certain treatments, at the time these decisions are needed. Second, it tells your doctor and loved ones which treatments you want and do not want if you are not able to communicate your wishes. Knowing your wishes helps your doctor and loved ones feel more comfortable making healthcare decisions for you. KIDNEY. ORG 7 What types of decisions can I make? With an advance directive, you may be able to: accept all treatments recommended by a healthcare provider accept some treatments and refuse others refuse all recommended treatments Some states may limit your ability to delegate the authority to refuse one or more types of treatment to someone else, for example, providing artificial nutrition or water. Some states may require that treatment be continued once it is accepted by your surrogate. It is important to speak with a lawyer or a social worker at your hospital or dialysis unit, or get a copy of your states advance directive forms. (See Where can I get advance directives forms? on. ) 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Which treatments can I include in my advance directive? You can choose to receive pain medicine for comfort, even if you refuse other treatments. You may be able to accept or refuse additional treatments, such as: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to attempt to revive a heart that has stopped beating. (CPR includes heart massage, drugs, electric shocks, and artificial breathing machines. ) Tube feedings, including giving food, water or both through a tube into a vein or the stomach. Artificial respiration, which is a machine (ventilator or respirator) that breathes for a person through a tube in the throat. Antibiotics to fight infection. Dialysis, either hemodialysis or peritoneal for kidney failure. Surgery such as heart bypass, gall bladder removal, etc. Blood transfusions or blood products, including specifying whether you would want blood only from your family members or friends. KIDNEY. ORG 9 Can an advance directive state the conditions under which dialysis could be stopped or continued? Yes. An advance directive enables you to tell your doctor and loved ones your feelings and wishes for continued treatment if and when you are no longer able to make this decision for yourself. You may tell your surrogate to stop dialysis if you: Develop severe brain damage (caused by stroke, Alzheimers disease, etc. )

You may tell your surrogate to stop dialysis if you: Develop severe brain damage (caused by stroke, Alzheimers disease, etc. ) and that you do not know or understand what is happening around you Cannot move independently (due to a stroke, paralysis, etc) Need to totally depend on others You may also state that you want to continue dialysis until: you die from another cause your doctor advises your surrogate that continued treatment is not medically reasonable Am I required by law to have an advance directive? No. The federal law and various state laws and regulations permit patients to sign advance directives but do not require you to sign them. A dialysis unit or hospital cannot require you to sign an advance directive. 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Do I need to see a lawyer to make an advance directive? You do not need to see a lawyer to make an advance directive. Usually, a social worker at your dialysis unit or hospital can help you. To find out more about the laws in your state, you may want to speak to a lawyer, a social worker at your treatment center or senior citizen center, or contact your state or local bar association. Also, see the resources listed starting on. KIDNEY. ORG 11 Where can I get advance directives forms? You can get copies of forms from your state or local bar association, most senior citizen centers, and those healthcare providers who are required to give information. You can also get your state forms on the Internet from state health department websites or from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (call or write for forms at the address or phone number listed on ). You can list the treatments you would or would not want without using a form, but a court or medical provider may not accept it. It is best to complete an advance directive on a state-approved form. 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Do advance directives forms have to be witnessed? Advance directives must comply with your states laws and regulations. State laws may require that these forms be witnessed or notarized. Banks and many other businesses have notaries who will notarize these forms. In some states, doctors and other healthcare providers are not permitted to witness advance directives. Should I speak to my doctor before making an advance directive? Yes. Your doctor can help explain treatment options to help you fill out the form. Also, you can let your doctor know what you would want under an advance directive and find out whether he or she would object to carrying one out. If so, you may want to find a doctor who will agree to treat you the way you want. How will people know if I have an advance directive? The only way your loved ones, friends, doctor or other healthcare providers will know that you have an advance directive is if you tell them.

Yes. You can donate organs or tissues by stating your wishes in an advance directive. However, it is important to tell your loved ones about your wishes concerning organ donation so they will carry them out. You may also want to speak to your lawyer about having a special provision in your living will stating that ventilators may be used to the extent needed to preserve your organs until the donation can be made. If your state allows you to designate your organ donation wishes in your drivers license, you should do so to ensure that your wishes are respected. Where can I get more information? Talk to members of your healthcare team or any healthcare provider. Healthcare professionals are obliged to give you information about advance directives. Talk with your lawyer, your local bar association, or the Legal Aid Society in your community or your senior citizen center. Also, see the list of resources starting on. KIDNEY. ORG 17 Topics to discuss with your loved ones Dealing with life and death issues can be difficult for many people. Yet, it is important that you decide how you feel about these things and what you would want if you should ever become unable to make your own decisions or communicate them to others. Talking over the following questions with a loved one may help. What is the poorest quality of life that would be acceptable for you? Under what circumstances, if any, would you want to stop dialysis? How do you feel about death and dying? How important is it to you being independent and making your own decisions? Do you have any health problems now? How would you describe them? Would your religious beliefs affect how you feel about life-sustaining treatments? If you were terminally ill with no hope of recovery, would you want any of the following life-sustaining treatments to continue? : comfort care (use of medicine to lessen pain) cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) tube feeding of food, water, or both mechanical or artificial respiration using a machine that breathes for you 18 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION antibiotics to fight infection dialysis surgery blood transfusions or blood products If you had severe and permanent brain damage, would you want any of the above life-sustaining treatments to continue? If so, which ones? If you were in a permanent coma, would you want any of these life-sustaining treatments to continue? If so, which ones? Do you think your family and friends would support you in your decisions about future medical care? Who would you want to state your decisions for you if you were unable to express them yourself? Would this person be agreeable to doing this? Would you want to donate any organs or tissue (heart, kidneys, liver, eyes, bone) to someone else at the time of your death? Specify which organs or tissues, if any, you would want to donate. Have you ever had to make a healthcare decision for someone?

ORG 9 Figure 1: Paired Exchange Hemodialysis What is hemodialysis? Hemodialysis is a treatment that removes wastes and extra fluid from your blood. During hemodialysis, your blood is pumped through soft tubes to a dialysis machine where it goes through a special filter called a dialyzer (also called an artificial kidney). As your blood is filtered, it is returned to your bloodstream. Only a small amount of blood is out of your body at any time. In order to be connected to the dialysis machine, you need to have an access, or entrance, to your bloodstream. (See, What is a hemodialysis access? ) Treatments are usually done 3 times a week. Each treatment lasts about 3 to 5 hours. In paired exchange, an incompatible donor/ recipient pair (such as a mother and son that dont have compatible blood types) are matched with another incompatible donor/recipient pair for a swap. Each donor gives a kidney to the other persons intended recipient. However, if you do not have a living donor, you will need to be on a waiting list until a kidney from a suitably matched deceased donor becomes available. In the meantime, you can have dialysis treatments. 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION KIDNEY. ORG 11 Where can I have hemodialysis treatment? Are there different types of home hemodialysis?

Racial and ethnic minorities are also more likely to progress from CKD to end-stage renal disease (ESRD)also known as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)and are less likely to have been under the care of a nephrologist before starting dialysis. These disparities are related to patient, clinician, clinical and system factors. Patient factors include genetic predisposition (e. g. , APOL1 risk variants), barriers to accessing care, low health literacy, cultural and attitudinal beliefs, such as mistrust of health care providers and language barriers. Clinician factors include limited knowledge of CKD, discomfort with its clinical complexity, and communication challenges. Clinical factors include conflicting guidance about screening for CKD and the complexity of treating patients with multiple comorbid conditions. System factors include limited access to care and lack of clinical decision support tools. Primary care practice teams can help reduce disparities in care for CKD through early identification, treatment, monitoring progression, collaborating with nephrologists and other specialists, building care teams and engaging patients. This educational guide is intended to foster the development of primary care practice teams in order to enhance care for vulnerable patients who are at risk of CKD or who have CKD and are at risk of progression of disease or complications. This guide addresses three aspects of care: identification of CKD; treatment and monitoring progression; and delivering patient-centered care. It is meant to inform readers about disparities in the care of patients with CKD, present potential actions that may improve care and suggest other available resources that may be used by primary care practice teams in caring for vulnerable patients. About Chronic Kidney Disease CKD is progressive loss of renal function, beginning with asymptomatic kidney damage and potentially ending in near total kidney failureESRDwhich requires renal replacement therapy for ongoing survival. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 37 million adults in the US have CKD and most of them are unaware of their condition. The clinical stages of CKD are defined by declining glomerular filtration rates (GFR) and albuminuria categories indicating increasing damage to kidney function. Equations for estimating GFR include adjustments for race, because non-Hispanic blacks have higher GFR than non-Hispanic whites at the same level of serum creatinine. Similarly, males have higher GFR than females and younger people have higher GFR than older people at the same levels of creatinine. of 19 April 2021 Introduction While CKD is typically progressive, it does not affect all patients at the same rate. Racial minorities have a greater risk of progressing from CKD to ESRD and progress more rapidly than their non-Hispanic white counterparts.

CKD is considered a disease multiplier because it often occurs with other conditions such as diabetes, hypertension or heart disease. Notably, CKD patients have a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease and death at every stage of CKD. The two conditions are linked: CKD and heart disease share risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension, and each condition can lead to or worsen the other. CKD is diagnosed through a blood test measuring serum creatinine and a urine test to assess albumin. CKD is staged using both results over a 3-month time period.

CKD is diagnosed through a blood test measuring serum creatinine and a urine test to assess albumin. CKD is staged using both results over a 3-month time period. In the early stages of CKD (Stages 13), the focus of care is on slowing or preventing progression and treating complications; in the later stages (Stages 45), the focus of care shifts to planning for kidney failure. The KDIGO Heat Map displays the risk of progression for each GFR category. Progression of CKD is related to control of comorbidities, (diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease), prevention of additional damage (acute kidney injury, nephrotoxic agents), optimizing health consequences (anemia, proteinuria), and recognition of population-based risk (race/ethnicity, age, family history). Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can prevent or delay progression to later-stage CKD, resulting in decreased morbidity, mortality and costs. Introduction KDIGO Heat Map (KDIGO, 2017) Source: Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). (2017). KDIGO 2017 Clinical Practice Guideline Update for the Diagnosis, Evaluation, Prevention, and Treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD). Available at Primary Care Is Key to Reducing Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease Interventions that can slow progression of CKD include early identification, controlling blood pressure, controlling blood glucose, reducing albuminuria, eating a healthy diet and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Primary care practice teams have an opportunity to apply population health strategies that may improve identification of individuals with CKD, improve care for patients with CKD and slow progression of the disease. As the front line of health care, primary care is especially important for conditions such as CKD, which may not cause symptoms until the late stages of disease. By increasing awareness of known racial, ethnic and economic disparities in care for CKD, this guide encourages primary care professionals to adopt strategies that can improve health care and health for vulnerable populations. of 19 April 2021 Introduction Example: Indian Health Service Improvements in Care for Chronic Kidney Disease The Indian Health Service (IHS) cut the rate of kidney failure in half for Rates of Kidney Failure from Diabetes by Race and Ethnicity: 1996 and 2013 Native Americans with diabetes by (Cases per 100, 000 people) applying population health approaches to patients with noted 60 socioeconomic disparities. In 1996, 50 American Indians and Alaska Natives 40 30 had the highest rates of diabetes20 related ESRD incidence, compared 10 with other racial and ethnic groups in 0 the US. By 2013, the incidence of Native Asians Blacks Whites Hispanics diabetes-related ESRD had Americans decreased from 57. 3 percent in 1996 1996 2013 to 26. 5 percent in 2013 (Bullock et al. , 2017). The decrease coincided with incorporating the assessment and treatment of CKD into IHS standards for managing diabetes. While the IHS had previously adopted systematic approaches to controlling diabetes, including multidisciplinary team-based care, patient education, community outreach, and tracking process and outcome data, the revised standards included: Routine laboratory reporting of GFR in the electronic medical record. Annual monitoring of urine albumin excretion.

While the IHS had previously adopted systematic approaches to controlling diabetes, including multidisciplinary team-based care, patient education, community outreach, and tracking process and outcome data, the revised standards included: Routine laboratory reporting of GFR in the electronic medical record. Annual monitoring of urine albumin excretion. Prescription of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). To improve diabetes care, IHS also developed clinical education programs and tools, culturally relevant patient education materials and electronic medical record-based population management tools. With these efforts, the IHS was able to achieve a 54 percent decrease in age-adjusted incidence of diabetes-related ESRD for patients with well-documented socioeconomic disparities, including poverty, limited health care resources and disproportionate burden of comorbidities (Bullock et al. , 2017). How This Guide Is Organized This guide is written for primary care practice teams and is intended to raise awareness of disparities in CKD and improve the care of vulnerable patients with CKD, and suggests possible approaches to improve the care of vulnerable patients with CKD. It is divided into the following sections: Summary. Approaches to Identifying Chronic Kidney Disease. Approaches to Treatment and Monitoring of CKD Progression. Approaches to Centering Care on the Patient. of 19 April 2021 Introduction Each of the topical sections in the guide explains the importance of the issue and describes potential interventions that primary care practice teams can take to address disparities in care. The Suggested Steps and Resources sections include links to available resources. Existing resources are paired with suggested action steps and are categorized by type (informational materials, practical tools, training materials) and format (CKD tracking tool, letter template, mobile app, online calculator, pamphlet/handout, reference material, referral form, video, webpage). Clinicians and their teams can use this guide to educate themselves, encourage the development and use of protocols to identify people with CKD, monitor progress, connect patients to appropriate resources and refer those who need specialty care. of 19 April 2021 Approaches to Identifying Chronic Kidney Disease Approaches to Identifying Chronic Kidney Disease Why Is It Important to Identify Chronic Kidney Disease? Why Is It Important to Identify Chronic Kidney Disease? Racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to progress from CKD to renal failure than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Beyond kidney failure, CKD progression has other consequences, such as anemia, hypertension, hypoglycemia, mineral and bone disturbances, cardiovascular disease, polypharmacy, medication side effects and death. Most CKD is a long-term consequence of difficult-to-control diabetes and hypertension, conditions that are more common among racial minorities and low-income populations. Early identification and intervention can slow or prevent CKD progression. CKD may have no symptoms in most stages, so many people are unaware of their CKD status until late-stage disease. In addition, limited provider awareness of CKD risk factors and surveillance guidelines can contribute to low patient awareness. Improving identification allows earlier treatment of CKD, which may reduce the number of people who progress to later-stage CKD, require transplant or dialysis or experience secondary consequences.

In addition, limited provider awareness of CKD risk factors and surveillance guidelines can contribute to low patient awareness. Improving identification allows earlier treatment of CKD, which may reduce the number of people who progress to later-stage CKD, require transplant or dialysis or experience secondary consequences. Identification of CKD typically includes screening at-risk individuals, determining the stage of disease and communicating results and next steps to patients. There are multiple challenges to improving disparities in identification of CKD: Clinical care teams and people at risk need to understand more about CKD, including its causes, stages and consequences. Primary care practice teams need protocols for detecting CKD. Most guidelines agree that people with diabetes or hypertension should be screened. Research shows that older individuals, non-Hispanic blacks, Native Americans and Hispanics should also be considered for CKD screening. Screening for CKD may be conducted by community-based organizations that are not coordinated with primary care teams. Addressing these challenges can improve identification of CKD in vulnerable populations, which has the potential to slow or prevent the progression of disease.

Why Is It Important to Treat and Monitor CKD Progression? Although the prevalence of CKD is relatively similar across racial and ethnic groups, minorities are more likely to progress from CKD to ESRD, and progress more rapidly than non-Hispanic whites. Clinical and system-wide interventions for slowing the progression of CKD largely consist of controlling risk factors, developing treatment plans and encouraging lifestyle changes.

Clinical and system-wide interventions for slowing the progression of CKD largely consist of controlling risk factors, developing treatment plans and encouraging lifestyle changes. Accordingly, management of CKD often coexists with control of conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Care for CKD consists of treating the risk factors for progression, including diabetes, hypertension, use of nephrotoxic medications, history of acute kidney injury, proteinuria and albuminuria, and treating the consequences of CKD, including anemia, electrolyte abnormalities and mineral bone disorders. The main interventions usually include: Medical treatment (e. g. , control blood pressure and glucose, manage cardiovascular disease, reduce albuminuria). Prevention (administer vaccinations, avoid nephrotoxic medications, including NSAIDS such as ibuprofen or naproxen). Nutritional guidance (e. g. , limit sodium intake). Lifestyle modifications (e. g. , exercise, quit smoking). Although interventions to slow progression or treat consequences of CKD are known, research suggests that many patients do not receive appropriate education about CKD and controlling risk factors, and minority patients are least likely to receive the information. Recent studies have shown that CKD registries have the potential to improve care for diverse populations in the areas of albuminuria monitoring, prescriptions for ACE inhibitors/ARBs, nephrotoxic medication use, hepatitis B immunizations, outpatient nephrology visits, vascular access placement and referral to transplant (Tuot et al. , 2018, Mendu et al. , 2019). Challenges to improving disparities in CKD treatment and fostering collaboration between primary care teams and specialists include: Clinical care teams need guidance on treating CKD in the context of comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Clinical care teams need tools that address multifaceted and complex health care needs, coupled with other life challenges that can impact the progression of disease in minority and underserved populations. Although electronic health records have the potential to support CKD care, they must be incorporated into the daily workflow and need additional functionality and customization to track clinical factors. Limited access to nephrologists for consultation. Addressing these barriers can improve CKD management in vulnerable populations, which has the potential to reduce disparities and the risk of progression to ESRD.

Why Is It Important to Center Care on the Patient Why Is It Important to Center Care on the Patient? The Institute of Medicine defines patient centered care as care that is respectful of, and responsive to, individual patient preferences, needs and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions (IOM, 2001). The Commonwealth Fund identified the following characteristics of a patient-centered primary care practice: superb access to care; patient engagement in care; clinical information systems that support high-quality care, practice-based learning and improvement; care coordination; integrated, comprehensive care and smooth information transfer across the provider team; ongoing, routine patient feedback; publicly available information on practices (Davis et al. , 2005). Treatment for CKD may be complicated by other health conditions and by socioeconomic challenges such as poverty, lack of health insurance, low health literacy, language barriers, inadequate access to healthy food, financial barriers to obtaining medications, limited transportation and environmental or safety concerns. Challenges to treating vulnerable CKD patients in primary care include: Limited time during clinic visits.

Challenges to treating vulnerable CKD patients in primary care include: Limited time during clinic visits. It takes time to educate patients about the causes, stages and consequences of CKD and how to manage it. A diagnosis of CKD can evoke an emotional response that can negatively affect the patients ability to learn how to manage it. Patients might have limited health literacy in CKD-related topics. Living conditions can significantly affect an individuals health status. Complex social determinants such as unstable housing, food insecurity, poverty, lack of education, unsafe neighborhoods and access to transportation contribute to disparities in CKD. Social Determinants of Health Health professionals are increasingly aware of the importance of nonmedical factors on health. Where and how a person lives can have a greater impact on health than medical care delivered by the health care system (Healthy People, 2019b). Organizations are working to develop tools for practices to address social determinants of health; for example, materials that educate teams about health disparities and health equity, assess implicit bias or offer guidance on collecting population data or building relationships with community-based organizations. These resources can help primary care practices evolve their care processes to meet patient needs more effectively. Delivering patient-centered care, forming multidisciplinary care teams (e. g. , pharmacists, community health workers, dieticians, social workers) and assessing social determinants of health can help address disparities in care for CKD. Improving Patient-Centered Care: Suggested Steps of 19 April 2021 Approaches to Centering Care on the Patient Improving Patient-Centered Care: Suggested Steps Resources Assemble a multidisciplinary care team with defined roles and responsibilities Identify multidisciplinary care team members (e. g. , pharmacists, community health workers, Informational dieticians, social workers) Materials Consider creating care coordination agreements with specialists and team members to formally specify responsibilities Develop a strategy for educating patients about CKD Determine the basic components of CKD education and adapt available resources of CKD education to your practice Review and refer patients to CKD resources that include a variety of formats and platforms such as written materials, podcasts, videos, appsto address variability in learning styles and Informational level of health literacy Materials Connect patients to CKD educational resources that are culturally and linguistically appropriate Training Consider community health workers, patient navigators and group educational efforts Materials Compile a list of community-based CKD resources and initiatives to share with patients and caregivers Refer patients to benefits available through Medicare (e. g. , medical nutrition therapy services, CKD education benefit) Understand and address the patients social determinants of health Ask patients about social determinants of health (e. g. , ability to pay for medications) Informational Incorporate CKD detection into the practice workflow Materials Practical Tools Identify community resources that can address social determinants of health Connect patients with resources that can meet their needs Include family, caregivers and the patients community in treatment Informational and educational efforts Materials Incorporate patient and family/caregiver preferences (e. g. , cultural, religious, personal values) Training into treatment plans and educational efforts.

ORG 3 Dealing with Emotions Why me? Anyone can get kidney failure, regardless of who you are, where you live, how old you are, or what type of work you do. Having kidney failure is a lot to handle. It requires lifestyle changesnot only for you, but for your family, too. This brochure can help you and your loved ones learn how to cope with kidney failure. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How does kidney failure affect patients and their families? In time, many patients accept the fact that they have kidney failure and will need treatment for the rest of their lives. Others have trouble with all the changes in their lives that the disease brings. Its important to understand that the stresses and frustrations of kidney failure are real. At times, it may be difficult for both you and your family to cope. You may feel like your world is caving in. Your family members may feel that way too, especially if they havent faced a major crisis before, or if the diagnosis was not expected. They may feel helpless because they cannot do anything about your illness. They may be angry that kidney failure has happened to their family or friend. They may fear that you may die. They may feel guilty if they did not realize the serious nature of your illness earlier. A period of confusion and tension may follow as everyone tries to cope with the demands of the illness, the anxiety of treatment, and the disruption of everyday life. You and your family will need time to adjust. Remembering that can help. KIDNEY. ORG 5 Is it normal to feel afraid?

You and your family will need time to adjust. Remembering that can help. KIDNEY. ORG 5 Is it normal to feel afraid? You and your family will have many emotions as you learn to live with kidney failure. You may feel sad, confused, anxious, fearful, angry, or even guilty. At times, your feelings may shift from disbelief and denial to acceptance or grief. The goal is to understand, cope with, and even accept your feelings, rather than ignore them or pretend they dont exist. Understanding that other people, like you, share many of your feelings can help. What youre going through is normal. It is part of getting used to your diagnosis, and to living with kidney failure. It can also be helpful to share your feelings with others, to ask for help, and to tell others what you need. Even your closest family members cannot read your mind. Its important to tell them how you feel. In addition to loved ones, other people can provide emotional support, including friends, clergy, support groups, chat rooms, professional counselors, and of course, your healthcare team. Is it normal to have mood swings? Moodiness is common among people with kidney failure. It can be caused by: Waste products. The buildup of waste products in the blood (called uremia), which can irritate the nervous system. Medicines. Some medicines may cause moodiness or make you feel depressed. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION The stress caused by chronic illness. The problems caused by your illness can make you irritable, angry, frustrated, and much more. Mood swings can come from feeling hopeless or helpless about having a lifethreatening disease. Your family members and friends might feel confused by your mood swings. It may help to talk with them about it openly and honestly. If they understand that being irritable and moody can be part of having kidney failure, they may find it easier to cope. You and your family may want to discuss ways for everyone to relax when tensions are high. Or you may want to consider family counseling. KIDNEY. ORG 7 Who can help my family and me adjust? All dialysis units and transplant centers have clinical social workers on staff who are trained to help with the nonmedical issues you and your family are facing. They can answer many of your questions or direct you to others who can help. Social workers are important members of your healthcare team. They can help to make kidney-failure treatment a more manageable part of your life. Inspiration and support can also come from other patients with kidney failure. Ask your social worker about support groups in your area. TIP If you would like to connect with another patient, the National Kidney Foundation can help. Contact us and ask about the Peers Lending Support Program. Call toll-free 855. NKF. PEERS (855. 653. 7337) or email nkfpeerskidney. org. When should I seek professional counseling? Feeling sad or upset on occasion is a normal part of life.

Contact us and ask about the Peers Lending Support Program. Call toll-free 855. NKF. PEERS (855. 653. 7337) or email nkfpeerskidney. org. When should I seek professional counseling? Feeling sad or upset on occasion is a normal part of life. However, there are times when you may need help coping with these feelings. Asking for help is not a sign of weakness, but of your desire to do well. Many people need help with their emotions as they learn to cope with kidney failure. 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION If you find yourself feeling overly sad, irritable, isolated, overwhelmed, unable to face each day, crying too much, or feeling like you want to give up, you may have depression. Its important to know that depression is a medical condition. It can be treated. You do not need to suffer from it, or be embarrassed about it. Studies show that 20% to 40% of people with kidney failure have depression. Your social worker can help you figure out if what youre feeling is depression, and can help you get treatment for it. Treatment may include medicine, counseling, or other kinds of support. Is it normal for people on dialysis to feel upset sometimes with the staff at a dialysis center? Yes. A dialysis center is different from any other healthcare setting. It can start to feel like the staff members are a second family because you spend so much time there. It is normal to feel frustrated and angry with them sometimes. It is important that you discuss your feelings openly with the staff. Keeping your feelings bottled up inside can affect your treatment, health, and emotional adjustment. Is it normal to feel anxious while waiting for a kidney transplant? Waiting for a suitable kidney can be stressful. If you have a living donor, your wait for a transplant should be fairly short. If you are waiting for a kidney from someone who has died, you may have to wait a long KIDNEY. ORG 9 timeperhaps even years. Using this time to learn as much as you can about a kidney transplant can help. Talk to others who have had a transplant and discuss your concerns openly with your healthcare team. The more you learn, the less anxious youll feel. What else should I understand about my emotions? Its important to understand that your emotions and physical health are connected. A healthy emotional life will help you to live longer and feel better. Your emotional health means many thingshow you cope, how you live, what you do to stay involved in the world around you, and how you relate to others. Its more than feelings or emotions. It means having a sense of purpose, experiencing joy, having hope, keeping active, and so much more. Set reasonable goals for yourself. Be flexible. Allow for mistakes. Try to keep a positive attitude. Spend time with people who make you laugh. All these things can help you stay healthy.

Try to keep a positive attitude. Spend time with people who make you laugh. All these things can help you stay healthy. 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Your Family and Relationships Can people with kidney failure still enjoy sex? Many people think that sexuality refers only to sexual intercourse. But sexuality includes many things, like intimacy, touching, hugging, and kissing. It includes how you feel about yourself, how well you communicate, and how willing you are to be close to someone else. There are many things that can affect your sexuality if you have kidney failurehormones, nerves, energy levels, even medicine. But there are also things you and your healthcare team can do to deal with these changes. Dont be afraid to ask questions or get help from a healthcare professional. KIDNEY. ORG 11 Its important to remember that people with kidney failure can have healthy marriages and intimate relationships. They can fall in love, care for families, and be sexual. Staying emotionally and physically close with those you love is important. And, its something everyone wants and needs. What if I lose interest in sex? Your interest in sex may change when you have kidney failure. At first, you may have less interest in sex. This can happen because you need a lot of energy to cope with the physical and emotional changes brought on by your illness. In time, your interest may return. Some men may find it more difficult to have or keep an erection. This is very common with kidney failure. It can result from the side effects of medicine, having a buildup of toxic wastes in the blood that may not 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION be fully removed by dialysis, or other things. Many of these problems can be treated. Dont be afraid to ask questions or get help from a healthcare professional. Emotions can also affect sexual functioning. This includes stress, depression, nerves, fear of disability or death, marriage problems, and much more. People with a kidney transplant usually have fewer sexual problems related to kidney disease. After the transplant, sexual functioning should return to normal. Can men with kidney failure father children? Yes. Men, who are on dialysis or are a kidney transplant recipient can have children. If youve been trying to have a child for a year or more without success, talk with your healthcare professional. KIDNEY. ORG 13 Can a woman with kidney failure have a baby? Some changes in your body may make it hard to get pregnant. For example, most women on dialysis have anemia (a low red blood cell count) and hormone changes. This may cause irregular periods. Women with kidney failure are usually advised against becoming pregnant. The risk to the mother and developing baby can be higher than in women who do not have kidney failure.

This may cause irregular periods. Women with kidney failure are usually advised against becoming pregnant. The risk to the mother and developing baby can be higher than in women who do not have kidney failure. If you are thinking about becoming pregnant, talk to your healthcare professional. If you become pregnant, you will need close medical supervision, which may include changes in medicine, and more dialysis to have a healthy baby. Can a woman who has had a transplant have a baby? Yes. If you have a kidney transplant, you are likely to have regular periods and good general health, so getting pregnant and having a baby is possible. However, its recommended that you do not become pregnant for at least one year after your transplant, even if you have stable kidney function. In some cases, pregnancy may not be recommended. This may be due to a high risk to your life or possible loss of the transplant. Talk with your healthcare professional if you have a transplant and are thinking about getting pregnant. 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Adjusting to a New Lifestyle How important is social activity? Being involved in the world around you and staying close to others is very important. Social support is something we all need, but its especially important for someone with a chronic illness. It may be helpful to find activities you enjoy that also provide social support, like walking clubs, volunteer work, babysitting, or taking classes. Your social worker can help you find groups and activities to join. Participating in hobbies, clubs, community action groups, sports, and spirituality can have a positive effect on your health. Dont forget that you are also a valuable friend and partner to others. Remember that your loved ones may need your support as well. On days that you feel well, ask what you can do for them. If you are feeling isolated or alone, talk to your social worker. There are support groups, patient mentors, and outreach services designed for people like you! KIDNEY. ORG 15 Can I work or go to school? Many people with kidney failure work or go to school full-time or part-time. Many people who start dialysis or have a transplant want to return to work or school quickly. It can help them to feel better and get their lives back to normal. Some people take a little time off from work when they first start dialysis, while others take a longer leave of absence to get used to dialysis or to recover from surgery. You should talk to your healthcare professional about when would be a good time for you to return to work or school. At first, returning to your daily routine, in addition to your treatment schedule, may be tiring. You may need support and encouragement at home and from your healthcare team. If you are thinking of giving up your job or education, you may want to consider taking sick leave or a brief leave of absence instead.

You may need support and encouragement at home and from your healthcare team. If you are thinking of giving up your job or education, you may want to consider taking sick leave or a brief leave of absence instead. Discuss your condition openly with your employer or school administrator if you think it will affect your ability to do the job, or to finish your degree. Answer 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION any questions or concerns they might have. Talk about any special needs you might have. For example, you might need to start work earlier in the day in order to go to dialysis. As you return to work or school, you should keep several things in mind: If you are on peritoneal dialysis and need to do an exchange during the day, you will need to ask your employer or school administrator for a clean, private place to do your exchange. A letter from your doctor may be requested. This letter should state that you are medically stable to return to work or school, and describe any limitations you may have. If you dialyze in a clinic, talk to your dialysis team about changing your dialysis schedule to better meet your needs. Most dialysis clinics will try to schedule a convenient shift for patients who are employed or in school. You may also wish to consider home dialysis options. This will give you more flexibility in your schedule. If you receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Social Security Income (SSI), the local Division of Vocational Rehabilitation Office may assist you in returning to a job or retraining you for a new job. For more information on the Social Security Administrations Ticket to Work program and other employment initiatives, go to ssa. gov/work or call 800. 772. 1213. KIDNEY. ORG 17 People facing dialysis treatment or a transplant may worry that their treatment could cause them to lose their job. The Americans with Disabilities Act is a law that was passed in 1990 that does not allow discrimination because of disabilities. If you are concerned about discrimination, contact an attorney, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or the Department of Labor. For information about filing a claim, call toll-free 800. 669. 4000. Can I travel? Yes, most people can travel safely and get dialysis treatments while away from home. Of course, you should always talk to your healthcare professional before travelling. Most healthcare professionals support travel if your overall health and kidney function is stable. If you like to travel, it may be a big boost to your spirits and sense of well-being. Its important to remember to bring more of the medications you may need, just in case there are any emergencies and you are not be able to return home as planned. Sometimes plans change due to poor weather, staffing problems, or other issues that can make travelling difficult and unpredictable. Also, check with your insurance company about coverage.

Sometimes plans change due to poor weather, staffing problems, or other issues that can make travelling difficult and unpredictable. Also, check with your insurance company about coverage. Medicare covers 80% of dialysis treatments in the United States. But in most cases, it does not cover dialysis treatments outside the United States. 18 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION When planning a trip: If you are on hemodialysis: You should make plans with a dialysis clinic in the area you wish to visit at least six to eight weeks in advance. You may need to plan even further in advance during popular tourist seasons. This is because some dialysis clinics may be full and less able to take in unscheduled patients. Many dialysis centers have a staff member who can help arrange treatments for you while you are away from home or help you make your own arrangements. If you are on peritoneal dialysis: You will need to make plans for back-up medical care if you are going to be out of town for any length of time. Your nurse or healthcare professional can give you a referral to a peritoneal dialysis program in the area you are visiting and make sure the right records are sent ahead of your visit. If you are on a transplant waiting list: Tell the staff how they can reach you at all times. If you are traveling somewhere you cannot be reached, you should change your status to on hold until you return. KIDNEY. ORG 19 Can I exercise? Yes. Physical activity will give you energy, reduce stress, and help you stay more independent. It can also improve depression and overall mood. Its important to talk to your healthcare professional before you begin an exercise program. You may have new limitations due to your dialysis access or protecting your transplanted kidney. Physical activity should not be confused with heavy exercise. If your ability to exercise is less than it was before, do not be discouraged. Any form of body movement helpswalking, gardening, dancing, even grocery shopping. The key is finding something you enjoy. Your energy will increase with activity, and, in time, youll be able to do more. 20 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Will my diet have to change? Yes. The type of diet you follow will depend on the treatment you receive. Your dialysis or transplant center will have a staff dietitian who can help you plan your meals to make sure you are getting the right amount of protein, calories, vitamins, minerals, and fluids. A dietitian can also work with you to develop a nutrition plan that allows you to enjoy your favorite foods and stay as healthy as possible. If you are on dialysis: You will need to eat less salt, avoid foods high in potassium and phosphorus, and limit fluids. If you have other health problems, such as diabetes or heart issues, you may have other food restrictions as well.

If you are on dialysis: You will need to eat less salt, avoid foods high in potassium and phosphorus, and limit fluids. If you have other health problems, such as diabetes or heart issues, you may have other food restrictions as well. If you have a kidney transplant: Some medicines can interact with certain foods and can cause harm to your new kidney. Talk to your healthcare professional because you may need to change your diet to protect your transplanted kidney. If you have other health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or weight gain, you may need to make other changes as well. Otherwise, you may not have many food restrictions. Remember, good nutrition and maintaining a healthy weight will go a long way in keeping your new kidney working well for as long as possible. KIDNEY. ORG 21 Your Finances and Insurance How will I pay for my treatments? Many costs for dialysis and kidney transplant are covered by the federal government through Medicare. Medicare is not just for people who are 65 and older. The program also includes many people who need dialysis or a kidney transplant. People with kidney failure can find out more about Medicare enrollment at their local Social Security office, or by calling 800. 772. 1213. Talk to staff at your dialysis clinic or transplant center for more information. 22 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Does Medicare pay for home hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis? The federal governments Medicare program covers 80% of the cost of home hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, just as they do for dialysis in a hospital or other treatment center. However, Medicare will not cover the cost of a home health aide if you have no one who can be a care partner for you. How much will Medicare cover? Medicare may pay up to 80% of the costs associated with dialysis and kidney transplant. But Medicare alone may not be enough. There are many other kinds of coverage that can help pay for what Medicare does not cover, including: State programs such as Medicaid and high-risk insurance pools TRICARE (if you are active in or retired from military service) Veterans benefits Employer health insurance, private health insurance, COBRA Medigap (Medicare supplemental health insurance) State kidney programs (where available) KIDNEY. ORG 23 To learn more about these options: Medicare: Contact Social Security at 800. 772. 1213 or check Medicares website at medicare. gov. You can also ask for a free copy of a handbook explaining Medicare coverage for dialysis and transplant services. State Medicaid: Contact your states welfare department (Department of Social Services) or visit medicaid. gov. TRICARE and veterans benefits: Contact your local Veterans Affairs office or check TRICAREs Web site at tricare. mil. Employer or private health insurance: Read your policy carefully and talk with your insurance agent or company benefits counselor. If you are 65 or older, you may be able to get counseling about health insurance benefits at your local senior citizens center.

mil. Employer or private health insurance: Read your policy carefully and talk with your insurance agent or company benefits counselor. If you are 65 or older, you may be able to get counseling about health insurance benefits at your local senior citizens center. Talk to your social worker if you are having difficulty paying for your medications. Many drug companies have programs to help people who cannot afford to pay for their prescription medications. 24 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Lets Review Its important to understand that the stresses and frustrations of kidney failure are very real, and at times very difficult. The following steps may help: Discuss your concerns with your healthcare team. Write down questions ahead of time. Remember, youre an important member of the team, and taking an interest in your own care will help you live better and longer. Share your feelings with family, close friends, fellow patients, and others you trust. Allow them to share their feelings with you. Together, you can learn how to help each other. Seek help and information from a social worker at the dialysis center or transplant clinic, or from an outside counselor. Stay close to others who are important you. Having healthy relationships with people is important for everyone, and its especially important for someone living with a chronic illness. Stay involved in the pleasures, activities, and responsibilities of daily living. Follow an exercise program approved by your healthcare professional. Try not to focus on your problems, but instead, on the good things that may be happening in your life. Be patient and set realistic goals. Get involved in your own care by finding out as much as possible about kidney failure and its treatment. Your treatment center, healthcare team, and the National Kidney Foundation can help. KIDNEY.

ORG 3 Introduction Most people enjoy eating out. This guide gives ideas for making your dining experience fun. Start by asking your kidney dietitian for any tips or advice. If you have sodium, potassium, phosphorus, protein, or fluid restrictions, this booklet will help you make good decisions. Your specific dietary needs will depend on your level of kidney function and other health conditions. PLAN AHEAD If you will be eating out for dinner, plan breakfast and lunch at home accordingly. Cut back on serving sizes and foods high in sodium and potassium during the day. Moderation is key. Call ahead to learn more 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION about the menu and how the food is prepared. Many restaurants now have websites where they list their menus. Many apps also provide nutrition information. Choose a restaurant where it will be easiest to select foods best suited for you. Restaurants where food is made to order are the best choice. Restaurant staff are used to special food requests or methods of preparation. However, some may require that you call at least 24 hours in advance to make arrangements. MAKING YOUR SELECTIONS Look over the menu carefully. Ask your server for more details about anything you do not understand. Practice making requests about the way your food is prepared or served.

Best meal choices might include fried chicken (with skin removed), corn, string beans or okra, wilted lettuce, corn bread, butter, and banana cake, apple cake or peach cobbler for dessert. Enjoy, and dont forget your phosphate binders. 24 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Fast Foods: Eating at fast-food restaurants is not totally out of the question. It does, however, take some thought and planning. While many fast-food items are pre-salted, there may be some items that are prepared without salt. You can also avoid high-sodium condiments, such as BBQ or soy sauce, and limit others, such as catsup, to one package. Many fast-food restaurants provide nutrition information, so you can check the sodium and potassium content. Your dietitian can also provide this information and tell you the specific amounts of sodium and potassium allowed in your diet.

STAGES 15 Dining Out with Confidence A Guide for People with Kidney Disease Stages of chronic kidney disease There are 5 stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) as shown in the table below. Your healthcare provider will tell you the stage of kidney disease, based on how well your kidneys are working and your estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The eGFR number comes from a lab test that measures the amount of blood your kidneys are filtering each minute. As CKD gets worse, the eGFR number goes down.

ORG 3 Introduction Most people enjoy eating out. This guide gives ideas for making your dining experience fun. Start by asking your kidney dietitian for any tips or advice. If you have sodium, potassium, phosphorus, protein, or fluid restrictions, this booklet will help you make good decisions. Your specific dietary needs will depend on your level of kidney function and other health conditions. PLAN AHEAD If you will be eating out for dinner, plan breakfast and lunch at home accordingly. Cut back on serving sizes and foods high in sodium and potassium during the day. Moderation is key. Call ahead to learn more 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION about the menu and how the food is prepared. Many restaurants now have websites where they list their menus. Many apps also provide nutrition information. Choose a restaurant where it will be easiest to select foods best suited for you. Restaurants where food is made to order are the best choice. Restaurant staff are used to special food requests or methods of preparation. However, some may require that you call at least 24 hours in advance to make arrangements. MAKING YOUR SELECTIONS Look over the menu carefully. Ask your server for more details about anything you do not understand. Practice making requests about the way your food is prepared or served.

Best meal choices might include fried chicken (with skin removed), corn, string beans or okra, wilted lettuce, corn bread, butter, and banana cake, apple cake or peach cobbler for dessert. Enjoy, and dont forget your phosphate binders. 24 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Fast Foods: Eating at fast-food restaurants is not totally out of the question. It does, however, take some thought and planning. While many fast-food items are pre-salted, there may be some items that are prepared without salt. You can also avoid high-sodium condiments, such as BBQ or soy sauce, and limit others, such as catsup, to one package. Many fast-food restaurants provide nutrition information, so you can check the sodium and potassium content. Your dietitian can also provide this information and tell you the specific amounts of sodium and potassium allowed in your diet. FAST FOODS Better Choices Poor Choices Regular or junior-size Large, superor king-size hamburgers hamburgers or cheeseburgers Roast beef or turkey sandwiches Sandwiches with bacon, sauces or cheese Grilled or broiled chicken Fried or breaded chicken sandwiches, tuna or chicken sandwiches, chicken nuggets salad or strips Unsalted onion rings French fries, Tater Tots, potato chips, baked potatoes, potato salad, baked beans Lettuce salads, coleslaw, High-potassium foods from macaroni salad, fresh tomato the salad bar or pickles slice Non-cola soda, lemonade, tea Milk shakes and cola sodas and coffee, water KIDNEY.

Sheriff2 University Medical Unit1, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Department of Clinical Medicine2, Faculty of Medicine, Colombo, Sri Lanka ABSTRACT. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing problem in Sri Lanka. Diabetes and hypertension are the main contributors to the disease burden. A new form of CKD of uncertain etiology (CKD-u) is the predominant form of CKD in certain parts of Sri Lanka, threatening to reach epidemic proportions. A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out over a three-month period at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka to identify the underlying etiologic factors for the disease in a cohort of patients with CKD. A total of 200 patients were studied with a mean age of 50. 57 years. Of them, 108 (54%) were in CKD stage V. Majority of the patients were from the western province (137, 68. 5%) with only five (2. 5%) from provinces with high prevalence of CKD-u. The most common underlying causes of CKD were diabetes (88, 44%) and hypertension (34, 17%). However, in patients younger than 40 years of age the most common cause was glomerulonephritis (20, 42. 6%). Diabetes was the most common cause of CKD among patients from the western province (74, 54%). The prevalence of CKD-u was twice as high in patients from areas outside the western province compared with patients from this province (P 0. 05). The low prevalence of CKD-u in the study population could be the result of poor representation of patients from provinces with high prevalence of CKD-u. Introduction stage renal disease (ESRD), there are more than 200 with overt CKD (stage III or IV) and Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is fast becoalmost 5000 with covert disease (stage I or II). 2 ming a global epidemic. 1 Data from the United Unfortunately, such data are not available for States suggest that for every patient with endmost of the developing countries, including Sri Correspondence to: Lanka.

CKD of uncertain or unknown etiology is an entity described in certain provinces of Sri Lanka. The geographic distribution of CKD-u appears to be based toward the northern regions of the country in which the north central, part of north western, and part of Uva provinces are included. The population at risk are scattered in the north central region with high prevalence observed at Medawachchiya, Padaviya, Dehiattakandiya, Girandurukotte, Medirigiriya and recently Nikawewa (Figure 1). This entity was discovered when several studies failed to identify a specific cause for CKD in the vast majority of the patients from these areas. For example, a recent study which was carried Figure 1.

ORG 3 Most people are aware that their blood pressure and cholesterol numbers are important in knowing their risk for heart and blood vessel diseases. Yet few know about estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), one of the numbers that measures the health of their kidneys. This brochure explains what eGFR is, how it is measured, and why it is important in understanding chronic kidney disease (CKD). How do doctors check for kidney disease? Kidney disease can be found with two simple tests: A urine test for protein (uACR) A blood test for creatinine (eGFR) Even if these tests are normal now, they should be repeated in the future, especially if you are at increased risk for kidney disease. Wouldnt I know if something was wrong with my kidneys? Not always. Early kidney disease can be silent, without pain or other symptoms. Most people do not know that they have early kidney disease. When kidney disease gets worse, some people do notice problems such as swelling around the ankles, puffiness around the eyes, high blood pressure, nausea, poor appetite, or vomiting. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION What is estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)? Your eGFR tells a lot about how well your kidneys are working. Your kidneys are important. They keep you healthy. They filter out waste and extra fluid from your blood, help make red blood cells, and keep your bones strong. When kidneys arent working well, wastes build up in your blood. Your bones can become weak. You may not have enough red blood cells for your bodys needs. Your eGFR number is a calculated measurement of how well your kidneys are working. If your eGFR number is low, your kidneys may not be working as well as they should. Its important to find this out early. Early treatment may help keep kidney disease from getting worse. How is eGFR checked? Having a simple blood test for creatinine is the first step in checking your eGFR. Creatinine is a waste product made by your bodys muscles. Your kidneys usually keep the level of creatinine just right. The level of creatinine in your blood, your age, and gender are used to calculate your eGFR.

Creatinine is a waste product made by your bodys muscles. Your kidneys usually keep the level of creatinine just right. The level of creatinine in your blood, your age, and gender are used to calculate your eGFR. Do you know what your eGFR is? Your healthcare professional or testing lab usually calculates your eGFR number. Be sure to talk with your doctor about the result. KIDNEY. ORG 5 Stages of chronic kidney disease There are 5 stages of kidney disease as shown in the table below. Your healthcare provider will tell you the stage of kidney disease, based on how well your kidneys are working and your estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The eGFR number comes from a lab test that measures the amount of blood your kidneys are filtering each minute. As CKD gets worse, the eGFR number goes down.

There are 5 stages of kidney disease as shown in the In adults, the normal eGFR number is more than 90. table below. Your healthcare provider will tell you the IF YOUR eGFR IS BETWEEN 60 AND 89 stage of kidney disease, based on how well your People with mildly low eGFR (between 60 and 89) kidneys are working and your estimated glomerular may not have kidney disease if there is no sign of filtration rate (eGFR). The eGFR number comes from a kidney damage, such as protein in their urine. These lab test that measures the amount of blood your people should have their eGFR checked often. They kidneys are filtering each minute. As CKD gets worse, may be asked to avoid medications that can damage the eGFR number goes down. the kidneys (such as ibuprofen) or reduce the dose of medicines that are removed by the kidneys.

ORG 7 Does age affect eGFR? Yes. eGFR gets lower with age, even in people without kidney disease. The older you are, the lower your eGFR. For this reason, the eGFR calculation takes age in to account.

More tests should be done to understand why it is low. The results of these tests may provide clues about what is happening with your kidneys. Examples of tests that might be ordered are: Urine tests that look for: The type and amount of protein in your urine (a sign of kidney damage) Red blood cells (a sign of bleeding in the urinary system) White blood cells (a sign of infection) Ultrasound or CT scan to get a picture of your kidneys and urinary system. These pictures show the size of your kidneys and if tumors, kidney stones, or cysts are present. A biopsy to remove a tiny piece of the kidney for evaluation. The sample is studied under a microscope to see what kind of kidney damage is may be present. KIDNEY. ORG 9 Am I at increased risk for kidney disease? Some people are more likely than others to develop kidney disease. You may be at increased risk for kidney disease if you: Have diabetes Have high blood pressure Have a family history of kidney disease or kidney failure Are age 60 or older Are overweight or obese If the tests find kidney disease, what does it mean for my health? If you have kidney disease, your kidneys have lost some of their ability to keep you healthy. They arent able to do their full jobs: filter your blood, help make red blood cells, and keep bones strong. The most common causes of kidney disease are diabetes and high blood pressure.

If you have kidney disease, your kidneys have lost some of their ability to keep you healthy. They arent able to do their full jobs: filter your blood, help make red blood cells, and keep bones strong. The most common causes of kidney disease are diabetes and high blood pressure. There are also other problems caused by kidney disease like high blood pressure, poor nutrition, and heart disease. 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Can treatment keep kidney disease from getting worse? The earlier your kidney disease is found, the better. If it is found and treated early, you may be able to keep it from getting worse. That is why it is so important for people with risk factors to be tested for kidney disease. Heart and blood vessel problems Poor nutritional health High blood pressure Anemia Bone problems Kidney disease affects many areas of the body. KIDNEY. ORG 11 The success of treatment depends on a number of things: Your stage of kidney disease when you start treatment. The earlier you start, the better you are likely to do. How carefully you follow your treatment plan. Learn all you can about kidney disease and its treatment. Talk to your doctor about what you can do. What caused your kidney disease. Some kidney diseases are more difficult to control. 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Key Points to Remember: Two simple tests will find chronic kidney disease: A urine test for protein (uACR) A blood test for creatinine (eGFR) Get a blood pressure measurement. eGFR is an important number that estimates how much kidney function you have. If you have kidney disease, a treatment plan will be developed especially for you. It will be based on your eGFR, the cause of your kidney disease, and other health factors. Your doctor will monitor your stage of kidney disease using your eGFR. You should keep track of it, too. You can keep kidney disease from getting worse by following your treatment plan carefully. If kidney disease progresses to kidney failure, dialysis or a kidney transplant will be needed. KIDNEY. ORG 13 Where can I get more information? If you have questions, speak with your healthcare team. They know you and can answer questions. You can also call the National Kidney Foundation Cares Patient Help Line toll-free at 855. NKF. CARES (855. 653. 2273) or email nkfcareskidney. org. A trained professional will listen to your concerns and answer your questions. 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Setting a standard for care The National Kidney Foundation, through its Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI), defines stages of kidney disease and offers guidelines that help your healthcare professional and healthcare team make important decisions about your medical treatment. The information in this booklet is based on those recommended guidelines. The information contained in this publication is based on current data and expert guidance available at the time of publication.

ORG 3 Introduction Healthy kidneys clean your blood and remove extra fluid in the form of urine. They also make hormones your body needs for some important functions. When kidney failure occurs, treatment is needed to replace some of the important jobs your kidneys do. The treatments for kidney failure are hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplant. Learn all you can and speak to your healthcare professional to find best choice for you. This booklet is written for people who may be getting ready to start treatment for kidney failure as well as for those who are already on hemodialysis. Information is based on recommendations from the National Kidney Foundations Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION When will I need to start treatment for kidney failure? Treatment is needed when someone has stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is also called kidney failure. Your healthcare professional can tell your stage of kidney disease by checking your estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Your eGFR is a calculation from the results of a blood test for creatinine, a waste product from muscle activity. If your eGFR falls below 15, you have kidney failure (CKD stage 5), and you will need to have a kidney transplant or dialysis treatment to replace the function of your kidneys. If your eGFR is less than 30 (CKD stage 4), your healthcare provider should talk to you about the different treatments for kidney failure. Ask about information classes in your area so you can learn more about kidney failure treatment options. How does hemodialysis help people with kidney failure? Hemodialysis is a life-saving treatment for people with kidney failure. A hemodialysis machine works as an artificial kidney by: Removing wastes and extra fluids in your body to prevent them from building up in your blood Helping to regulate blood pressure KIDNEY.

Hemodialysis is a life-saving treatment for people with kidney failure. A hemodialysis machine works as an artificial kidney by: Removing wastes and extra fluids in your body to prevent them from building up in your blood Helping to regulate blood pressure KIDNEY. ORG 5 How does hemodialysis work? A hemodialysis machine has a special filter called a dialyzer to clean your blood. To get your blood to the dialyzer, a surgeon will make an opening into one of your blood vessels. This opening is called an access, this is done with minor surgery, usually in your arm. Fistulas and grafts are two types of accesses that are used. A fistula is the first choice for an access. It is made by joining an artery to a nearby vein under your skin to make a bigger blood vessel. This type of access is preferred because it has fewer problems and lasts longer. You should be evaluated by a special doctor called a vascular surgeon at least six months before you will need to start dialysis. A fistula should be placed early (several months before starting dialysis) so it has plenty of time to heal and be ready by the time you start treatment. If your blood vessels are not suitable for a fistula, a graft may be done. This involves joining an artery and a nearby vein with a small, soft tube made of synthetic material that is placed under your skin. After the fistula or graft has fully healed, it can be used for dialysis. During dialysis, two needles will be placed into your access. Each needle is connected to a plastic tube. One tube carries your blood to the dialyzer where it is cleaned and the other tube returns the cleaned blood back to your body. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION There is a third type of access, called a catheter, which is a soft tube that is placed into a large vein in your neck or chest. This type of access is generally used only when you need dialysis for a short period of time. Catheters can be used as a permanent access when a fistula or a graft cannot be placed. Catheters can be connected directly to the dialysis tubes and needles are not used. Catheters have more health complications than other types of access. KIDNEY. ORG 7 How does the dialyzer clean my blood? Inside the dialyzer, or filter, there are two sidesone for your blood and the other for a fluid called dialysate. A thin film, called a membrane, separates these two sides. Blood cells, proteins, and types of cells remain in your blood because they are too big to pass through the membrane. Smaller waste products, such as urea and creatinine, and extra fluid, move from your blood through the mem brane, and are removed. The composition of the dialysate, or cleansing fluid, is made for your special needs according to your healthcare professionals prescription. 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Where is hemodialysis done?

The composition of the dialysate, or cleansing fluid, is made for your special needs according to your healthcare professionals prescription. 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Where is hemodialysis done? Hemodialysis can be done at a hospital, a dialysis center or even at home. You and your healthcare professional should work together to decide where it would be best for you to have your hemodialysis treatment. How long will each hemodialysis treatment last? Hemodialysis treatments are usually done three times a week. Each treatment lasts about four hours, but you may need more time to make sure that enough wastes and fluids are removed. Just how often you should get dialysis depends on: How well your kidneys are working The amount of fluid you retain between treatments The amount of waste products you have in your blood The kind of dialyzer you are using Your healthcare professional will recommend and write a dialysis prescription that is best for you. Studies have shown that getting the right amount of dialysis improves your overall health, makes you feel better, keeps you out of the hospital, and may help you to live longer. KIDNEY. ORG 9 How do I know if I am getting the right amount of dialysis? Your healthcare professional will develop a special dialysis prescription for you. This will help to make sure that you get the right treatment. In addition, your dialysis care team will monitor your treatment with monthly lab tests to measure the amount of dialysis you receive (your dose of dialysis). The most accurate way to measure this is called urea kinetic modeling. The number that tells how well your blood is being cleaned by dialysis is your Kt/V (sounds like kay tee over vee). Your goal Kt/V number may change depending on how often you have dialysis and on how well your kidneys are working. For example, many dialysis patients who have treatments 3 times a week, should have a Kt/V of at least 1. 2 for each treatment. There are other ways to measure the dialysis dose that is delivered. One is called the urea reduction ratio (URR). If this ratio is used to measure your delivered dose of dialysis, your URR should be at least 65% for each treatment. 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Tips Know your dose of dialysis Ask your dialysis care team which test they are using to determine your dose of dialysis. Ask what your number is. If you are not pleased with your number, ask how it can be improved.

If you are not pleased with your number, ask how it can be improved. Your dialysis care team is available to help you make sure your: Access is working well Dialyzer is working well Blood flow and the flow rate of the dialysate fluid (cleansing fluid) are working well during dialysis Blood samples are taken correctly You can also help to make sure you are receiving the right dialysis dose by: Keeping all your appointments Completing your full treatment Taking care of your access KIDNEY. ORG 11 Can hemodialysis be done at home? Many patients have their hemodialysis treatments at home. If you and your healthcare professional decide home hemodialysis is a good choice for you, then you will be trained how to do hemodialysis at home. Home hemodialysis allows you to schedule your treatments to fit your routine. Your home must have enough space for the equipment and enough water drainage and electric power to operate the dialysis machine and water purification unit. Medicare covers up to 80% of the cost of home hemodialysis, just as they do for dialysis in a hospital or other treatment center. Medicare may help cover the cost of minor plumbing or electrical modifications to your home for home hemodialysis. There are three types of home hemodialysisconventional, short daily, and nocturnal. Conventional home hemodialysis is usually done 3 times a week for 3-5 hours. Short daily home hemodialysis involves more treatments per week for shorter periods. Nocturnal hemodialysis involves longer, slower treatments, which are done while you sleep, usually for 6 to 8 hours. 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Research shows that people who use short daily and nocturnal home hemodialysis: Take less medication to control high blood pressure and anemia Take less medication to keep high blood phosphorus under control Have improvements in blood pressure, nerve damage, and symptoms of restless leg syndrome Feel better during dialysis and less washed out after dialysis Have fewer limits on their diet and fluid intake Have more energy Sleep better Have fewer and shorter hospital stays Have a better quality of life Live longer With daily home hemodialysis, you dont have the swings in your blood chemistries and fluids like you do when you dont dialyze every day, so you feel a lot better.

ORG 15 Tips Protect your remaining kidney function Studies show that maintaining as much kidney function as possible, leads to greater overall satisfaction in people on dialysis. Ask your dialysis care team about the steps you can take to help keep your kidney working as well as possible, such as: Take blood pressure medicines, if needed, as instructed by your healthcare professional. Studies show that some blood pressure medicines may help protect kidneys from further damage. Avoid medicines that can harm your kidneys, such as some pain relievers called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and certain antibiotics. Ask your healthcare provider about taking diuretics (water pills) to help remove salt and water from your blood. Make sure conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure are well-controlled. Can dialysis cure my kidney disease? In some cases of sudden (also called acute) kidney failure, dialysis may only be needed for a short time until the kidneys get better. However, when kidney disease progresses slowly over time to kidney failure, your kidneys do not get better. You will need dialysis for the rest of your life, unless you are able to receive a kidney transplant. 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Tips Staying comfortable on dialysis If you experience symptoms like cramps, headaches, nausea, or dizziness during dialysis, ask your dialysis care team if any of the following steps could help you: Slow down your fluid removal, which could increase your dialysis time. Check the dose and timing of your blood pressure medications. Adjust your dry weight or target weight. Lower the temperature of the dialysate a little. Ask your healthcare provider if it would help to change to a different type of dialyzer. You can help yourself by carefully following your sodium (salt) and fluid limits between treatments to decrease fluid buildup in your body. KIDNEY. ORG 17 Will I need to follow a special diet? Yes. Your diet will be different from the one you followed before starting dialysis. Although certain foods may be limited, you need to get the right amount of protein and calories to maintain good health. The registered dietitian at your center will help you develop a meal plan that meets your needs. Its important to keep to your fluid and sodium (salt) limits so you dont build up too much fluid in your body between treatments. This buildup may lead to needing more fluid removal (ultrafiltration) during your dialysis treatment. Ultrafiltration may cause some discomfort during your treatment. Excess fluid buildup can also increase your blood pressure. 18 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION To help prevent fluid buildup between treatments, your daily diet should not include over 2, 000 mg of sodium (salt). Your dietitian can help you plan a low sodium diet. You may also need to limit the amount of potassium and phosphorous in your diet. Review your monthly labs with your dietitian and discuss your individual diet needs.

Your dietitian can help you plan a low sodium diet. You may also need to limit the amount of potassium and phosphorous in your diet. Review your monthly labs with your dietitian and discuss your individual diet needs. Tips Keep sodium levels under control Limit the amount of sodium in your diet and help prevent too much fluid buildup by trying the following: Cook with herbs and spices instead of salt. Read food labels; choose foods low in sodium. When eating out, order meat or fish without salt. Ask for gravy or sauce on the side because these may contain large amounts of salt and should be used in small amounts. Limit use of canned, processed, and frozen foods. Avoid salt substitutes and specialty low-sodium foods made with salt substitutes because these are high in potassium. Speak to your dietitian if you have any questions or want more tips. KIDNEY. ORG 19 What insurance coverage is available for dialysis? The federal governments Medicare program covers 80 percent of all dialysis costs for most patients. If you are not already on Medicare when you start dialysis, your coverage will start on the 1st day of the 4th month. If you begin a home training program within your first 90 days of treatment, then coverage will be retroactive, which means you will be covered starting back on day 1. Private insurance or state Medicaid programs may also help with the costs. Ask your social worker or financial coordinator about your insurance options. Dialysis centers also have billing personnel who can answer your questions about insurance coverage and billing. Will dialysis change my lifestyle? You and your family need time to get used to dialysis and your treatment schedule. The social worker at your dialysis center can provide support and help you and your family adjust to changes in your lifestyle. Once you get used to your treatment, you should feel a lot better. In fact, you may feel more like doing some of the activities you enjoyed before you developed kidney disease. Medications are available to treat anemia and also help keep your bones healthy so you can feel stronger and less tired. 20 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Can people on dialysis travel? Yes. Dialysis centers are located in every part of the United States and in many other countries. Before you travel, you must make an appointment for dialysis treatment at another dialysis center. The staff at your dialysis center may be able to help you arrange the appointment. KIDNEY. ORG 21 Can people on dialysis continue to work? Yes. Many people on dialysis work when they are on dialysis. If your job requires a lot of physical labor (heavy lifting, digging, etc. ), you may need to change your duties. Tips Improve your quality of life Ask your healthcare provider about an exercise program that is right for you. Regular exercise can make you feel stronger. Learn all you can about your treatment.

Learn all you can about your treatment. Speak to your dialysis care team if you have any questions. They are there to help you do well on your treatment. Spend time with loved ones doing things you enjoy. 22 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Understanding your lab values Albumin and normalized protein nitrogen appearance (nPNA) are measures of your nutritional health. The test results show if you are getting enough protein and calories from your diet. Average daily weight gain is the amount of fluid weight you gain each day between dialysis treatments. If you do not follow your fluid and salt limits between treatments, you may gain too much fluid weight. Calcium and phosphorus are two minerals that are important for bone health. Having too much or too little amounts of these minerals in your blood can lead to loss of calcium from the bones and increased risk of heart and blood vessel disease. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a calculation that measures how well your kidneys are working. Your eGFR can be calculated using the results of your blood creatinine test, your age, and gender. Hemoglobin is the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen to your tissues. If your number is too low, you have anemia, and you will need to take one or more medicines to raise the red blood cell level in your body. Kt/V and URR are measures of your dose of dialysis. They tell whether you are receiving the right amount of dialysis. KIDNEY. ORG 23 Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is made by four small parathyroid glands, which are located in your neck. If these glands make too much PTH, you may lose calcium from your bones. Over time, this can weaken your bones and cause them to break more easily. Pre-dialysis and post-dialysis blood pressure should be taken each time you receive dialysis. Your blood pressure goes down when excess fluid and salt are removed from your blood by your dialysis treatment. Potassium is a mineral that is important for a healthy heart. High or low levels of potassium in your blood may be harmful for your heart. Target weight (or dry weight) is how much you should weigh after dialysis removes excess fluid from your body. Transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin are measures of iron stored in your body. Iron is needed to make red blood cells. You may need extra iron if you have anemia (low iron). 24 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Where can you get more information? If you have questions, speak with your healthcare team.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24 KIDNEY. ORG 3 Introduction Whether you are already on hemodialysis treatment or you will soon be starting dialysis, this booklet will help you better understand the ways hemodialysis machines reach (access) your blood for filtering. Some of the covered topics include: Choosing the best access for you Pros and cons of different access types Your access is important for best results from hemodialysis treatment Access care Maintaining your access 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION What is a hemodialysis access? A hemodialysis access, sometimes called a vascular access, is an opening made in your skin and blood vessel during a short surgical procedure. When you have dialysis, your blood flows out of the access through soft tubes and into a hemodialysis machine. After your blood is filtered in the machine, it goes through a soft tube to the access and back into your body. Are different types of access available? Yes, there are three types of accesses that are used for hemodialysis. Your doctor should teach you about the pros and cons of each one. Your doctor should refer you to a special surgeon with hemodialysis access experience at least six months before you need to start treatment. A surgeon can evaluate you and help you choose the type of access that is best for you. When your doctor tells you that you will need dialysis in the near future, you should protect the arm where the surgery will be done. Dont allow anyone to draw blood or give you an injection in this arm. Also, never let anyone use a cuff to take your blood pressure from this arm. You should wear a medical alert bracelet to inform hospital staff about your arm. KIDNEY. ORG 5 AV FISTULA Vein (V) Artery (A) AV Fistula An AV (artery-vein) fistula is the best choice for hemodialysis. It is preferred because it: Usually lasts longer Has fewer problems like clotting and infections A fistula should be placed several months before you need to start dialysis. This allows the fistula enough time to fully heal before starting dialysis. Minor surgery is needed to create the fistula. It is made by connecting a vein to a nearby artery, usually in your arm. This creates a large blood vessel that has a fast flow of blood. Your lower forearm (between the wrist and elbow) is the preferred location for your fistula. A fistula usually takes one to four months to mature, which means the vein becomes larger due to increased blood flow. Once the access has matured, dialysis treatments can start. Ask your healthcare provider when you can start doing exercises, such as squeezing a rubber ball, to help your fistula mature Fistulas usually last for many years. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION AV GRAFT Vein Artery An AV (artery-vein) graft is usually the second choice for an access.

Ask your healthcare provider when you can start doing exercises, such as squeezing a rubber ball, to help your fistula mature Fistulas usually last for many years. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION AV GRAFT Vein Artery An AV (artery-vein) graft is usually the second choice for an access. Minor surgery is done using an artificial tube between a vein and a nearby artery. The AV graft generally needs to be in place at least two weeks after surgery before they can be used. CATHETER A catheter is most often used for a temporary access. For example, it is sometimes used for a short time in people who get an AV fistula and need to fully healed before it can be used. KIDNEY. ORG 7 Sometimes a catheter is used over a long period of time because a fistula or graft is not possible. Catheters are made of soft plastic tubing. There are two parts, one for removing your blood and the other for returning the cleaned blood to your body. A catheter is typically placed only when you need to start dialysis immediately. It is put in a large vein, usually in your neck but sometimes in your upper chest. Catheters have more problems (like clotting and infections) than fistulas or grafts. They may not allow for enough blood flow for good dialysis treatment. 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Pros and Cons of different access types AV Fistula Pros and Cons PROS: Lasts longer Not prone to infection Provides excellent blood flow once it is ready to use Less likely to develop blood clots and become blocked You can take showers once the access heals after surgery CONS: Needs to mature, which takes one to four months, before it can be used Needles are used to connect to the dialysis machine KIDNEY. ORG 9 AV Graft Pros and Cons PROS: Provides excellent blood flow once it is ready to use You can take showers once the access heals after surgery CONS: Does not last as long as an AV fistula More prone to infection than an AV fistula Needs at least two weeks before it can be used Clotting can be a problem that may require surgery or other treatment to correct Needles are used to connect to the dialysis machine 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Catheter Pros and Cons PROS: Can be used right away No needles are needed to connect to the machine. CONS: Usually a temporary access Most prone to infection May not have enough blood flow for best dialysis results Blood clots can form that block blood flow through the catheter Can cause narrowing of major blood vessels Check with your care team to see if showering is an permitted KIDNEY.

This tells them if enough fluids and waste products are being removed from your blood. Your delivered dose of dialysis will be checked by doing a blood test to measure your Kt/V (pronounced kay tee over vee). If you are getting the right amount of dialysis, your Kt/V should be 1. 2 or more. Another test that measures your delivered dose is called urea reduction ratio (URR). Your URR result should be 65% or more. If your Kt/V or URR numbers are too low, your access may not be working well. Will my dialysis care team check my access? Yes, you should have a complete physical exam of your access before every dialysis treatment. KIDNEY. ORG 15 Caring for your AV fistula or graft Ask your dialysis care team to teach you how to prevent infection and keep your fistula or graft working well Wash your access site every day with an antibacterial soap (ask your dialysis care team to recommend a good soap to use) Wash your access site before every dialysis treatment (your dialysis center has hand washing sinks and antibacterial soap) Do not scratch your access (your fingernails can be a source of infection) Your nurse or technician should clean your access site with an antiseptic before putting the needles in (do not touch your access area after it has been disinfected) Your nurse or technician should wear a surgical mask, a face shield, and clean gloves when working near your access 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Avoid coughing or sneezing on your access site during treatment Always wear a clean glove or use a clean gauze pad if you are holding your own access site after the needles are removed Apply only gentle pressure to stop bleeding after the needles are removed (press only where the needle was placed and just below never press above where the needle was) Call your dialysis care team at once if the area of the access is sore, swollen, red, or feels hot this could be a sign of infection Protecting your AV fistula or graft Do not let anyone measure your blood pressure on your access arm (your other arm should be used instead) Do not let anyone take blood from your access arm when you are not on dialysis If the vibration (thrill) or sound (bruit) of your access is absent or seems different, call your dialysis care team at once because your access may not be working well Ask your dialysis care team how to make your needle sticks as comfortable as possible. Different sites for the needles can be used for each dialysis People who have a fistula can ask to use a button hole technique, which is a less painful way to use same site for each dialysis KIDNEY.

ORG 17 Preventing catheter-related infections Ask your dialysis care team to teach you how to prevent infections and keep your catheter working well Be sure your catheter has a clean, dry dressing during and after every dialysis (make sure your nurse or technician checks your catheter for signs of infection at every dialysis) Make sure you wear a surgical mask when you are being connected to or disconnected from the dialysis machine Make sure your nurse or technician wears a surgical mask, face shield, and clean gloves when working near your catheter Use a protective cover for your catheter when showering (ask your dialysis care team how to get one of these covers) Ask your nurse or technician to teach you how to change the dressing Keep extra dressing supplies in your home in case you need to replace your dressing Contact your care team is you see or feel anything unusual with your access 18 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Access problems What kinds of access problems can happen? How are they treated? Sometimes, even when you take the best care of your access, you may have problems. If an infection occurs, your doctor will order antibiotics for you. If your access develops a clot, it needs to be treated with special medications. Sometimes this medication can be given in the dialysis unit. Other times, you may need to go to the hospital for treatment. Sometimes surgery is needed to remove a clot or repair an access. Angioplasty may be needed to widen a narrowed fistula or graft. Your dialysis care team will check your access for problems. You, too, can help spot possible problems. Learn the warning signs listed on pages 20-21. Contact your doctor or dialysis center right away if you notice any of them. KIDNEY. ORG 19 Warning signs of access problems INFECTION Warning signs: Redness, swelling, soreness, and/or a feeling of warmth around your access site; fever, chills, and/or achy feeling. Steps to take: Call your doctor or dialysis care team at once. Youll need to take antibiotic medicine prescribed by your doctor. CLOTTING OR POOR BLOOD FLOW IN YOUR ACCESS Warning signs: Absence of the vibration (thrill) or sound (bruit) at your fistula or graft site; swelling of your arm; lower skin temperature around the access site; a decrease in your delivered dose of dialysis (Kt/V or URR); or changes in other lab values. 20 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Steps to take: Call your doctor or dialysis center. Keep a record of your Kt/V or URR and other labs. Speak to your dialysis care team when there are changes. BLEEDING FROM YOUR ACCESS Warning signs: Bleeding from a fistula or graft that lasts more than 20 minutes after your dialysis treatment is over.

Keep a record of your Kt/V or URR and other labs. Speak to your dialysis care team when there are changes. BLEEDING FROM YOUR ACCESS Warning signs: Bleeding from a fistula or graft that lasts more than 20 minutes after your dialysis treatment is over. Any bleeding from a catheter site or catheter tube. Steps to take: For bleeding from a fistula or graft, gently press your access with a clean gauze pad to stop the blood; if bleeding lasts more than 20 minutes, call your doctor or dialysis center at once. For bleeding from a catheter site or tube, call your doctor or dialysis center at once, or go to the emergency room at your local hospital. DECREASED CIRCULATION IN YOUR ACCESS ARM Warning signs: Feelings of numbness, tingling, coldness, or weakness in your arm; blue fingers or sores at the tips of your fingers. Steps to take: Call your doctor or dialysis center right away (this must be treated at once to prevent nerve damage in your access arm). KIDNEY. ORG 21 Summary Key points to remember Keeping your access working well will help you get the most from hemodialysis and help you feel your best. If your access is not working well, it can decrease the amount of dialysis you receive, which may affect your overall health and how long you live on dialysis. A fistula is the preferred type of access. If you are already receiving hemodialysis and you do not have a fistula, ask your doctor or dialysis care team if you are a candidate for a fistula. Make sure your dialysis care team checks your access often. They should do some special tests to make sure it is working well. 22 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Do not let anyone measure your blood pressure on your access arm, or take blood from your access arm when you are not getting dialysis. Your other arm should be used to measure blood pressure and do blood tests. Ask your dialysis care team to teach you the steps for good access care to prevent infection and keep your access working well. Know the warning signs for problems with your access. Track your important test results, such as your Kt/V and your URR. Ask your dialysis care team if you have any questions about your access or any other aspects of your hemodialysis care. KIDNEY.

No part of this publication may be reproduced, transmitted, transcribed, stored in a retrieval system, or translated into any language in any form or by any means without written (cid: 1) permission of Henry Ford Health System. Foreword K IDNEY disease, some acute but mostly chronic remains the core of this SIXTH EDITION of CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD): CLINICAL PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH by Editors Jerry Yee Gregory D. Krol. This edition represents a significant departure from Editions 15. It is now multi-authored, underscoring the complexity of Chronic Kidney Disease, better known in the vernacular as CKD a disease domain complex that is highly associated with a progressive cardiovascular disease burden. Aside from the multi-authorship of the SIXTH EDITION, this work provides exciting illustrations by Dunham Design and immaculate print quality by Dynamic Marketing. As with prior editions, the writing remains consistently concise, precise, and decisive. I NTERESTINGLY, the booklet was originally conceived and written for the Henry Ford Health System. However, like the automotive industry of the City of Detroit, it has significantly transcended its local borders. All told, more than 30, 000 copies have been distributed within the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Canada since its original publication. From the first edition that provided textually based nuts and bolts management of CKD through its fifth edition, the booklet has gained in quality and size, while providing up-to-date information. The first edition brought to the fore the importance of the eGFR in the screening of this under-recognized entity, CKD. The second and third editions amplified the importance of the cardiovascular complications of CKD. The fourth and fifth editions emphasized evidence-based practice across the continuum of CKD care and provided colorful easy-to-read diagrams. Essentially, it is not a textbook steeped in information that is outdated by the time of printing, but a periodical that reliably informs Primary Care Physicians about CKD essentials. Overall, the content is current and crystallized, ready for translation into clinical practice. D EDICATED readings of the HENRY FORD CKD BOOKLET as it is known outside of the Henry Ford Health System are suggested in order to fully comprehend the complexity of CKD.

Overall, the content is current and crystallized, ready for translation into clinical practice. D EDICATED readings of the HENRY FORD CKD BOOKLET as it is known outside of the Henry Ford Health System are suggested in order to fully comprehend the complexity of CKD. It should be on the must have list of Internal Medicine housestaff and Nephrology fellows-intraining as it continues to remain popular among the younger generation of physicians, nurses, and mid-level providers. Its Internet presence accounted for 1, 000 downloads in 2010. Translation into other languages is under consideration and there is clamor for mobile device distribution. Most importantly, the booklet has received plaudits from national organizations and societies, and its format and content have been adapted by multiple agencies, including the Michigan Quality Initiative Consortium (MQIC) and the National Kidney Foundations of Michigan and Illinois. 2 N EW information regarding the eGFR is highlighted in the SIXTH EDITION. As the underpinning of the stages of CKD, knowledge regarding the functionality of the eGFR has matured, with validation across more populations. Standardization of the serum creatinine by isotope dilution mass spectrometry is occurring increasingly across clinical laboratories in the United States. This recalibration lowers the eGFR by 6%. Notwithstanding this improvement in eGFR reporting, combining this parameter with proteinuria more clearly delineates the risk category of a CKD patient. Principally, proteinuria of (cid: 1)2 on dipstick analysis or within the macro-albuminuric range portends a poorer renal outcome. Lastly, this edition prominently features an international perspective on CKD-Mineral and Bone Disorder. E XPERT and representation of the respective clinical disease domains of CKD distinguishes and enhances this version. Now, this mini-compendium renders an even broader perspective to CKD with the following contributions: DIABETIC KIDNEY DISEASE by Susanne Nicholas (UCLA) HYPERTENSION by Debbie Cohen and Raymond Townsend (Univ. of Penn) PROTEINURIA by Julie Lin (Brigham and Womens Hospital) ANEMIA OF CKD by Anatole Besarab (Henry Ford Hospital) NUTRITION IN CKD by M. Cristina Kilates (Henry Ford Hospital) CKD-MINERAL AND BONE DISORDER by L. Tammy Ho (Univ. of Chicago) MEDICATION-RELATED PROBLEMS SELECTED AGENTS by Carol Moore (Henry Ford Hospital) KIDNEY REPLACEMENT THERAPY by Jariatul Karim Lalathaksha Kumbar (Henry Ford Hospital) WEBSITE MANAGEMENT by Gerard Zasuwa (Henry Ford Hospital) Each chapter follows the outlines of the previous versions: brief introduction, evidence base, pathophysiology, and guidelineor expert consensus-based diagnosis and therapy. THE PLAN OF CARE ACTION PLAN and the CHECKLIST remain outstandingly simple, informative, and efficient formats to present a large body of information into digestible learnings. These two invaluable components of the SIXTH EDITION distill numerous guidelines and consensus-based recommendations by level of evidence and grade of quality to improve our practices. Y ES! is the feeling that I had upon completing the SIXTH EDITION. You, the reader should review it, digest it, practice it, and also, enjoy it. I certainly did and still do.

KAMYAR KALANTAR-ZADEH, MD, MPH, PHD UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES 3 CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE STAGING AND PROGRESSION by Gregory D. Krol Introduction Optimal management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) requires appropriate interpretation and use of the markers and stages of CKD, early disease recognition, and collaboration between primary care physicians and nephrologists. Because multiple terms have been applied to chronic kidney disease (CKD), eg, chronic renal insufficiency, chronic renal disease, and chronic renal failure, the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF KDOQI) has defined the all-encompassing term, CKD. Using kidney rather than renal improves understanding by patients, families, healthcare workers, and the lay public. This term includes the continuum of kidney dysfunction from mild kidney damage to kidney failure, and it also includes the term, end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Definition and Interpretation Management of CKD requires the clear understanding of its definition as proposed by the National Kidney Foundation (NKF). An informed interpretation of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is required, since the GFR is still considered the best overall index of kidney function in stable, non-hospitalized patients. Kidney damage is defined by any one of the following findings: a) pathologic kidney abnormalities b) persistent proteinuria c) other urine abnormalities, eg, renal hematuria d) imaging abnormalities e) eGFR 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2 on two occasions separated by (cid: 1)90 days and that is not associated with a transient, reversible condition such as volume depletion. The 5 stages of CKD are based on eGFR (see TABLE). CLASSIFICATION OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE Estimated GFR Stage Comment (mL/min/1. 73 m2) 1 ≥90 Normal GFR w/ proteinuria 2 6089 Age-related decline in GFR w/proteinuria 3A 3059 Low risk of progression to kidney failure 3B 4 1529 High risk of progression to kidney failure 5 5D 15 Kidney failure 5T Because of greater cardiovascular disease risk and risk of disease progression at lower eGFRs, CKD Stage 3 is sub-divided into Stages 3A (4559 mL/min/1. 73 m2) and 3B (3044 mL/min/1. 73 m2. CKD Stage 5 includes patients that may require or are undergoing kidney replacement therapy. Designations 5D and 5T indicate end-stage renal disease patients who undergo chronic dialysis (5D) treatment or have undergone kidney transplantation (5T). 4 The eGFR is primarily determined by serum creatinine (SCr), and the preferred method for estimating GFR is the body surface area-normalized, 4-variable, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) Equation based on SCr, age, gender, and ethnicity. eGFR (mL/min/1. 73 m2) 186 (SCr)1. 154 (Age)0. 203 (0. 742, if female) (1. 212, if African American) Replace the constant 186 with 175, if the laboratory uses a standardized SCr (IDMS method). This reduces eGFR by 6%. eGFRs based solely on BUN and creatinine or by 24-h endogenous creatinine clearances, are not required for routine screening of CKD.

742, if female) (1. 212, if African American) Replace the constant 186 with 175, if the laboratory uses a standardized SCr (IDMS method). This reduces eGFR by 6%. eGFRs based solely on BUN and creatinine or by 24-h endogenous creatinine clearances, are not required for routine screening of CKD. As with all tests, the eGFR has limitations. eGFR calculations may be inaccurate in the following circumstances: acute hospitalizations, acute kidney injury (AKI)/acute renal failure (ARF), malnutrition, major limb amputation, cirrhosis, severe obesity, and at the extremes of age. It is not recommended to use eGFR in lieu of SCr during AKI/ARF. Improved eGFR equations, CKD-EPI and Cystatin-C equations, remain as research tools, and the 4-parameter MDRD eGFR remains the current gold standard. Regardless of the measure, most cases require appropriate appreciation of kidney function and must include an assessment of retrospective and prospective markers of kidney function aside from eGFR, including BUN and urinary protein excretion, in order to more completely assess etiology, stability, progression, or improvement in renal function, and to guide therapy. Normal physiologic age-related changes in kidney function often lower GFRs to 6090 mL/min/1. 73 m2. The age-related decline in GFR is 1 mL/min/1. 73 m2/yr, beginning after 3040 y. o. In addition and paradoxically, the reduction of muscle mass associated with aging may overestimate the GFR and potentially mislead the healthcare provider. Notably, the majority of CKD Stage 3 or 4 patients will not develop CKD Stage 5/kidney failure (1% risk). However, if other evidence of kidney disease is present, eg, proteinuria; imaging study revealing small (9 cm by ultrasonography) or echogenic kidney(s), cysts or stones; resistant hypertension (HTN); or rapid or acute elevations of BUN and SCr, an etiology of CKD must be established and aggressive therapy is warranted. Generally, a kidney-specific imaging study (renal ultrasonogram, CT scan) is not required in the following clinical setting: eGFR 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2 with no proteinuria because the overwhelming majority of such studies are normal. Epidemiology Persons with CKD have significantly higher rates of morbidity, mortality, hospitalizations, and healthcare utilization. The prevalence of CKD Stages 25 has continued to increase since 1988 as have the prevalences of diabetes and hypertension, which are respectively etiologic in approximately 40% and 25% of CKD cases. The current estimate is that 26 million US persons 20 y. o. have CKD. However, 15. 2 % is the more recent CKD prevalence estimate, based on 20032006 NHANES data of U. S. adults aged (cid: 1)20 y. o. , a decrease from the 15. 9% cited in the NHANES data collected from 19992002. This decrease was reflected in CKD Stage 1 as Stage 3 increased to 6. 5% from 20032006. The prevalence of CKD Stages 4 and 5 has doubled since 19881999, but has remained stable since 2002 at 0. 6%. 5 CKD stage prevalence from NHANES 20032006 by the CKD-EPI equation are Stage 1, 4. 1%; Stage 2, 3. 2%; Stage 3, 6. 5%; and Stages 4 and 5 combined, 0. 6%.

6%. 5 CKD stage prevalence from NHANES 20032006 by the CKD-EPI equation are Stage 1, 4. 1%; Stage 2, 3. 2%; Stage 3, 6. 5%; and Stages 4 and 5 combined, 0. 6%. Stratified by age, all CKD stages were more prevalent in persons aged (cid: 1)60 y. o. (39. 4%) than in those aged 4059 y. o. (12. 6%) or 2039 y. o. (8. 5%). By educational level, CKD at any stage was more prevalent among persons with less than a high school education (22. 1%) than in persons with at least a high school education (15. 7%). CKD prevalence was greater among non-Hispanic blacks (15. 6%), nonHispanic whites (14. 5%), and among other ethnicities (13. 1%). The prevalences of diabetes and HTN in African Americans with CKD were 60. 6% and 96%, respectively, compared to Caucasian prevalences of 45. 7% and 90. 7%, respectively (United States Renal Data Survey, 2010). Also, CKD prevalence was higher in diabetics than non-diabetics (40. 2% v 15. 4%), in those with cardiovascular disease (CVD) than in those without it (28. 2% v 15. 4%), and in those with HTN than in those without it (24. 6% v 12. 5%). For 2010, the estimated cost of ESRD is 28 billion, and projected as 54 billion by 2020. In the last quarter of 2009, the prevalence of ESRD (N572, 569, includes kidney-transplanted patients) was greater than in 2005 (N485, 012). In terms of incidence or newly-initiated ESRD patients, diabetes was etiologic in 37. 5%, HTN 24. 4%, glomerulonephritis 14. 8%, cystic disease 4. 7%, and others 18. 6%. African American patients are 3. 7 times more susceptible for development of ESRD, and Native Americans and Asians are 1. 9and 1. 3 times more likely to develop ESRD. Recognition, Screening and Stratification of CKD Only 5% and 10% of the general Medicare population undergoes a screening urinalysis or a SCr, respectively. The NKF KEEP (Kidney Early Evaluation Program) screening program is a free community-based survey that identified individuals with CKD over the past 10 years. Since its inception, KEEP has screened 150, 000 at-risk individuals with diabetes and/or HTN or those with a first-order relative with known kidney disease, diabetes, or HTN. Urine was evaluated for hematuria, pyuria and microalbuminuria. The KEEP population was better educated, had more insurance, and a higher prevalence of HTN, obesity, and diabetes than the NHANES cohort. Specifying CKD as a low estimated GFR and/or presence of microalbuminuria, 26% of KEEP/high risk participants had CKD nearly twice that noted in the general population NHANES study. Strikingly, only 2. 0% of these high risk patients self-reported a history of kidney disease. These consistent findings over the past decade underscore the lack of recognition and education regarding CKD and the missed opportunities to better manage, prevent, and reduce CKDs associated premature and increased comorbidties, mortality, and high healthcare costs. Stratification of CKD into 5 stages focuses the clinician on CKD management aspects.

These consistent findings over the past decade underscore the lack of recognition and education regarding CKD and the missed opportunities to better manage, prevent, and reduce CKDs associated premature and increased comorbidties, mortality, and high healthcare costs. Stratification of CKD into 5 stages focuses the clinician on CKD management aspects. The metabolic abnormalities of CKD evolve in a fairly well established pattern. Anemia of CKD and CKD-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) often begin during Stage 3. Hypertension is aggravated in CKD Stages 35 and acid-base balance, dyslipidemia, and glucose homeostasis become deranged later. During Stages 35, reductions in medication dosages may be required because of a lower eGFR. The disease domains of HTN, proteinuria, and hyperlipidemia may appear at any stage and therapy must be targeted to specific levels. Lastly, screening for metabolic complications of CKD is typically not recommended in persons with eGFR 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2 and no albuminuria, unless a genetic disorder with a high degree of penetrance is present (autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease). The development of CKD multiplies the mortality risk associated with CVD, particularly in CKD Stages 4 and 5. CKD increases CVD morbidity and mortality risks in diabetics by 2to 4-fold and 6 in patients with HTN and diabetes by 4to 8-fold. Further, CKD-attributable CVD risk increases rapidly through CKD Stages 35 by several-fold. At-Risk Groups CKD carries a 3-fold higher risk of death. Therefore, clinical risk factors for the initiation and/or progression of CKD should be ascertained during routine healthcare encounters and periodically, thereafter. Individuals at increased risk for CKD must be tested for kidney damage and have their eGFRs evaluated more frequently. In addition, aggressive risk factor reduction should be carried out in individuals at increased risk for CKD even when CKD is not clinically apparent. A CKD risk factor classification, based on a cardiovascular scheme follows (see Table, p. 9). Hypertension (prevalence 74. 5 million) and diabetes (prevalence 23. 6 million) are the two most important CKD risk factors. Overall, diabetes is prevalent in 44% of the ESRD population and in HTN 28%. Together, these two disorders constitute 72% of the causes of ESRD. Recently, insulin resistance, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome have been implicated as risk factors. A family history of kidney disease is a risk factor for CKD. Nearly 24% of ESRD patients have an afflicted first-degree relative, an association that is much stronger in African Americans than whites. Other CKD risk factors include the following: a prior history of AKI/ARF, urinary tract obstruction, stones, reduced kidney mass (solitary kidney), nephrotoxins (analgesics, aminoglycosides, amphotericin, radiocontrast), autoimmunity (SLE), low birth weight, preeclampsia, sociodemographics (older age, male gender, reduced access to healthcare, low income/education level, hazardous chemical or environmental exposures), and certain ethnicities: African American, Native American, Hispanic, and Asian. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)/Acute Renal Failure (ARF) The term ARF is being increasingly supplanted by the term AKI, but precise and consensus-based definitions of AKI have only recently been introduced.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)/Acute Renal Failure (ARF) The term ARF is being increasingly supplanted by the term AKI, but precise and consensus-based definitions of AKI have only recently been introduced. AKI is common and occurs at a rate of 522 cases/100, 000 pt-yr. Thus far, AKI staging systems that define renal risk, injury, and failure have not consistently predicted renal or morbid outcomes due to select patient-specific demographics, preexisting CKD and comorbidities (see TABLE, P. 8). Such systems require further refinement. AKI often complicates CKD, particularly in Stages 35. Persons with or without preexistent kidney disease may incur permanent decrements in kidney function after single or repeated episodes of AKI/ARF. The optimal method of establishing CKD is by examining medical records; renal imaging is the next best method, eg, kidney ultrasonography (US) or CT scan. By US, normal, adult kidney sizes are 1012 cm in the sagittal plane; however, size discrepancies up to 37% may be found. AKI represents a substantial risk factor for progressive CKD. A single episode of AKI may generate a steeper decline in renal function than normally expected from aging alone. Therefore, patients who develop severe AKI or recover slowly from AKI must be closely monitored, even when the eGFR returns to baseline. Rapid recovery of AKI (7 d) generally requires minimal follow-up, unless there was pre-existing CKD. AKI is categorized as prerenal, parenchymal, and postrenal etiologies. To eliminate the latter from the differential diagnosis, always rule out urinary outlet obstruction when establishing an etiology for AKI/ARF, particularly in males with clinically undiagnosed prostatic hyperplasia. AKI continues to occur with increasing frequency and constitutes 70% of Nephrology inpatient 7 consultations. The increased utilization of pharmaceuticals has increased the frequency of immune-mediated (allergic) tubulointerstitial nephritis, particularly from antibiotics. When challenged by sodium (volume) depletion, CKD patients often develop AKI more rapidly than normal individuals. The consequent prerenal azotemia, from absolute (vomiting, overdiuresis) or relative volume depletion (cirrhosis, nephrosis or heart failure) accounts for nearly 40% of cases of hospital-acquired AKI. Administration of pharmaceuticals such as NSAIDs, antibiotics (aminoglycosides), or iodinated radiocontrast media can induce AKI/ARF. Lastly, volume depleted patients are more susceptible to radiocontrast-induced nephropathy. This disorder accounts for 317% cases of hospital-acquired ARF, and this is often preventable (see MEDICATION-RELATED PROBLEMS IN CKD, P. 51). CLASSIFICATION OF ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY / ACUTE RENAL FAILURE Stage Serum Creatinine Urine Output 1 SCr(cid: 1) of ≥0. 3 mg/dL 0. 5 mL/kg/h for 6 h Risk SCr (cid: 1) of ≥1. 5-2. 0-fold 2 SCr (cid: 1) of ≥2. 03. 0-fold 0. 5 mL/kg/h for 12 h Injury 3 SCr (cid: 1) of ≥0. 3 mg/dL or 3-fold from baseline 0. 3 mL/kg/h for 24 h Failure SCr ≥4. 0 mg/dL with acute (cid: 1) ≥0. 5 mg/dL Anuria for 12 h CKD patients undergoing cardiothoracic and/or other emergent surgical procedures that occur with blood loss, sepsis and/or radiocontrast administration have highly increased risk for AKI/ARF.

3 mL/kg/h for 24 h Failure SCr ≥4. 0 mg/dL with acute (cid: 1) ≥0. 5 mg/dL Anuria for 12 h CKD patients undergoing cardiothoracic and/or other emergent surgical procedures that occur with blood loss, sepsis and/or radiocontrast administration have highly increased risk for AKI/ARF. In these circumstances, the GFR cannot be reliably determined since it depends on steady-state creatinine generation and elimination. CKD patients treated with anti-RAAS medications commonly develop elevations of BUN and SCr. The potential benefits of chronic anti-RAAS treatment likely outweigh a mild stable decline of GFR from ACEI and ARB use. Generally, increases in SCr of up to 30% and serum K levels of 5. 5 mEq/L can be tolerated. However, unless moderate hyperkalemia (K 5. 5 mEq/L), oliguria, relative hypotension, or a substantial GFR reduction occurs, these agents should generally be continued. Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Fortunately, most patients do not progress from CKD Stage 3 to 5, but 17% of CKD Stage 4 patients will progress to Stage 5 and 1% of CKD Stage 3 patients will. However, the transition to CKD Stage 4 is often insidious and under-recognized. Importantly, this transition represents a clinical event similar to a stroke or acute myocardial infarction because CKD Stage 4 is marked by a major increase in cardiovascular mortality and progression to CKD Stage 5. During CKD Stage 4, death is a competing risk for progression to ESRD. Comprehensive systems targeting early recognition, prevention and management, and treatment by primary care physicians and physician extenders are required at this critical stage in collaboration with nephrologists. 8 Aside from uncontrolled HTN, one of the strongest prognosticators for declining kidney function is proteinuria. A spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPC) or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) quantifies proteinuria. Generally, UPCs 0. 51 g protein per g creatinine predict a more favorable prognosis, while UPCs 1 predict more rapid functional decline and more intensive evaluation, ie, kidney biopsy. Modifiable risk factors for CKD progression are HTN, diabetes, morbid obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypercholesterolemia, heavy consumption of non-narcotic analgesic preparations, anemia, and cigarette smoking. Perhaps the best prognosticator for CKD progression is the rate of decline of GFR. Rates of decline 4 mL/min/1. 73 m2 per year are associated with greater progression risk. In diabetics, annual eGFR rates of decline (cid: 1)1012 mL/min/1. 73 m2 may occur. In heart failure, eGFR declines (cid: 1)15 mL/min/1. 73 m2 per year are associated with worse anemia and progression to CKD Stage 5. African American ethnicity is a major risk factor for progressive CKD from type 2 diabetic kidney disease, HTN (nephrosclerosis), and HIV. In general, Native Americans, Hispanics, and Asians have increased risk for type 2 diabetic CKD. Cigarette smoking aggravates CKD. Risk factors that promote the accelerated atherosclerosis of CKD include elevated angiotensin II levels, proteinuria, secondary hyperparathyroidism, dysregulated calcium and phosphate metabolism, ECF volume expansion, and the intrinsic chronic inflammatory state of CKD.

Int J Clin Pract 64(13): 1784, 2010 10 CONSULTATION by Jerry Yee Introduction In a survey, family medicine physicians (N89), general internists (N89), and nephrologists (N129) evaluated a case of progressive CKD. Family medicine and internal medicine doctors recognized and recommended subspecialist care for progressive CKD less frequently than nephrologists. Their opinions also differed from nephrologists regarding evaluations by and expectations of nephrologists. The survey recommended the following: a) greater dissemination of existing clinical practice guidelines b) targeted CKD-specific education c) consensus-building and guideline development by family medicine physicians, internists, and nephrologists. Data from dedicated CKD clinics corroborate these findings. Currently, there is a concerted effort from many nephrology societies, including AMA, AHRQ, and ABIM to improve CKD education for those who must engage and practice it. Timely consultation by the nephrologist in CKD promotes improved clinical outcomes and reduces the total cost of care for the patient and the public. It has been estimated that healthcare savings of 18. 5 to 60. 6 billion would accrue by reducing the CKD progression rate by 1030% over the next decade. The optimal time for consultation is during CKD Stages 34. As eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1. 73 m2 (CKD Stage 3B), there is a significant increase in CVD risk. Crossing this eGFR threshold is equivalent to experiencing a major cardiovascular event. This risk is worsened at any CKD stage by the presence of persistent proteinuria. Estimating the GFR is important because this process not only optimizes the time of referral, but also delineates the progression rate of CKD. Urinary abnormalities, electrolyte imbalances, uncontrolled HTN, or metabolic abnormalities constitute reasons to initiate nephrological consultation. Certain conditions such as malignancy, dementia, multiple comorbidities, or an advanced directive may preclude referral to a nephrologist. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) MDRD Study GFR 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2 Cockroft-Gault CrCl 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2 Serum Creatinine (SCr) Males (cid: 1)1. 51. 7 mg/dL on two separate occasions, separated by at least 2 wk, unless AKI/ARF is established Females (cid: 1)1. 11. 3 mg/dL on two separate occasions, separated by at least 2 wk, unless AKI/ARF is established 11 COMMENTS Normal age-related decline in GFR is 1 mL/min/1. 73 m2/yr after age 3040 y. o. However, there is significant normal variation. Trend analysis at the individual level is key. An unexplained, non-reversible rapid decline in GFR is considered to be (cid: 1)4 mL/min/1. 73 m2/yr and should prompt a nephrology consultation. GFR is the principal but not the only determinant of SCr levels. Hypercatabolic states or muscle injury may increase the SCr as can increased creatine ingestion (supplement). Cimetidine, trimethoprim, corticosteroids, pyrimethamine, phenacemide, salicylates, and vitamin D metabolites can elevate SCr, but do not reduce GFR. Cimetidine, trimethoprim, pyrimethamine, probenecid, triamterene, amiloride, and salicylates inhibit tubular creatinine secretion. Cephalexin, flucytosine and nitrofurantoin interfere with the creatinine assay and increases the plasma measured level ex vivo. Tetracycline (anti-anabolic), GI bleeding, and glucocorticoid steroids increase protein catabolism and increase BUN but not SCr levels.

Microvascular disease is much more prevalent in type 1 DKD than in type 2 DKD. Specifically, retinopathy marked by the development of new retinal vessels is present in almost all type 1 DKD and 60% of type 2 DKD. Therefore, the absence of retinopathy or the presence of small kidneys by ultrasound in the latter group should prompt a search for a different etiology of CKD since other primary renal disorders such as focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis and minimal change disease, among others, may exist in patients with DM. In addition, IgA nephropathy, and membranous nephropathy may co-exist with DKD. In some series, diabetic nephropathy may be accompanied by another non-hypertension-related kidney disorder in 515% of cases. In the United States, it is estimated that 50% of diabetic patients will develop DKD. In type 2 DM, there is an incidence of 3%/yr for the development of nephropathy (overt proteinuria) after 1020 yr of poorly controlled disease. In general, the key markers of CKD are increased urine albuminto-creatinine ratio (UACR) and increased SCr estimates of GFR (eGFR), 60 ml/min/1. 73 m2, 15 from 2 abnormal readings at least 3 months apart. Microalbuminuria (30300 mg/24 h; UACR 3-30 mg/g) is the earliest clinical sign of DKD and is typically present in 2030% of type 1 diabetics 15 yr after the onset of DM. Progression to macroalbuminuria (300 mg/24 h; UACR 30 mg/g) is associated with increased progression of CKD and possibly, ESRD. The level of proteinuria 2g/24-h may be identified qualitatively by (cid: 1)3 urine dipstick or followed quantitatively by the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPC; normal 0. 2 g/g), or a 24-h urine collection. The 24-h urine protein is considered the gold standard of urine protein determination as protein excretion may vary with the circadian rhythm, particularly in patients with glomerular disease. Afternoon (after 1600 h) UPC testing may significantly underestimate the morning UPC or 24-h urine protein. Proteinuria 3. 5g/24-h is considered nephrotic range proteinuria. A spot morning (08001200 hours) UPC has been shown to correlate well with the 24-h urine collection in patients with DKD, and therefore is also a good screening test for DKD and for monitoring patients on a stable treatment regimen. Benign proteinuria that occurs due to fever, intense exercise, postural changes, volume depletion, or acute illnesses should be reevaluated during stable conditions. The typical annual rates of progression of DKD from the diagnosis of DM to microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, and then to advanced CKD or ESRD are 2. 0%, 2. 8%, and 2. 3%, respectively. DM and microalbuminuria represent independent risk factors for CVD. In addition, nearly 7080% of diabetic CKD patients are hypertensive. Thus, routine screening for DKD is recommended for diabetic patients as follows: a) annual testing of urinary albumin excretion by spot UACR and eGFR in type 1 diabetic patients with (cid: 1)5 yr duration of DM and b) annual testing of all type 2 diabetic patients from the time of diagnosis.

Because several factors may cause transient increases in microalbuminuria, the diagnosis requires at least 2 serial first-morning urine specimens over 23 weeks. Occasionally, proteinuria in DM may herald other possible causes of CKD, particularly glomerular disorders as described above. Suspect other causes when one or more of the following is present: a) absence of diabetic retinopathy or neuropathy b) presence of low or rapidly decreasing GFR c) presence of rapidly increasing proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome d) refractory hypertension e) active (blood and protein) urinary sediment f) manifestations of other systemic disease g) presence of 30% reduction in GFR within 23 months of the initiation of anti-reninangiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS) therapy. The rate of improvement in renal function following this initial expected physiologic decline in eGFR will depend on several patient-related factors, such as disease severity and ethnicity. For example, African Americans typically display earlier and more rapid declines in renal function. The presence of one or more of these clinical scenarios should prompt urgent patient referral to a nephrologist for confirmatory and/or additional diagnoses. Clinical remission of renal disease has taken place when proteinuria declines to 1 g/24-h, and regression is defined by a decline in proteinuria to 0. 3 g/24-h. 16 Treatment Considerations Due to increased CVD risk in diabetic patients, prompt treatment of DKD and other CV risk factors is critical. Therefore, treatment of DKD toward therapeutic targets (eg, HbA1C, BP, lipids, BMI) involves risk factor reduction to prevent DKD progression and a multimodal approach that addresses lifestyle modification. Such modifications include a DASH (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension), restricted dietary sodium intake at 1. 5 g/24 h, smoking cessation, restricted dietary intake of saturated fat and cholesterol (200 mg/24-h), and regular aerobic exercise. Spontaneous remission of microalbuminuria may occur in some patients with types 1 and 2 DM. This may be attributable to improved BP control and/or glycemic control. The strongest predictors of progressive DKD are the presence of poor glycemic control, hypertension, and glomerular hyperfiltration. Importantly, as DKD progresses, the requirements for insulin to maintain glycemic control diminish as renal metabolism and excretion of insulin concomitantly and progressively decreases. A reduction in insulin and/or other antihyperglycemiant medications (not metformin) may be required to prevent hypoglycemia. Thus, the three mainstays of optimal DKD treatment are: a) strict glycemic control b) tight BP control c) maximal proteinuria reduction with an ACEI or ARB, singly or in combination. There are multiple, well-conducted clinical studies which indicate that these strategies retard the progression of DKD. The non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, diltiazem and verapamil) are anti-proteinuric and may potentiate the anti-proteinuric effects of anti-RAAS treatment(s). Even greater inhibition of the RAAS by the addition of a direct renin inhibitor (eg, aliskiren) or an aldosterone receptor antagonist (eg, aldosterone or eplerenone) may achieve improved anti-proteinuric effects. New research has uncovered an antioxidant drug, bardoxolone methyl that induces genes that suppress inflammatory mediators as a potential anti-proteinuric agent in the treatment of DKD.

At-Risk Groups African Americans develop hypertensive CKD (nephrosclerosis) much more frequently than Caucasians. Genetic susceptibility to hypertensive nephropathy associated with genetic polymorphisms (eg, APOL1, MYH9) in African Americans may contribute to this risk. In addition, hypertensive kidney disease in African Americans may not always be attributable to high BP and may reflect an underlying glomerular disorder. Suspect these in non-diabetic individuals diagnosed with hypertensive nephropathy when their UPCs are 1 or UACRs are 300 mg/g. African Americans also tend to respond less well than Caucasian patients to monotherapy with beta blockers (BBs), ACEIs (angiotensin-convertingenzyme inhibitors) and/or ARBs (angiotensinreceptor blockers). However, ethnicity-related differences in therapeutic response are usually nullified by concomitant diuretic therapy. For example, the response to combined thiazide diuretic-ACEI/ARB therapy is equivalent among the various ethnicities. Therefore, no particular agent should be avoided in patients of African American ethnicity. Since non-diabetic CKD patients have equivalent or greater risk for the development of CVD as diabetic patients without CKD, cardiovascular protective measures in addition to antihypertensive therapy must always be considered. Since a given individuals BP response to high sodium intake (salt sensitivity) is not predictable, sodium restriction should generally be enforced in all CKD patients, ie, 1500 mg sodium (65 mEq Na) per day. Blood Pressure Profile Hypertension in CKD is considered by default as resistant HTN, ie, treatment requires 3 or more antihypertensive agents at maximally tolerated doses and one of which must be a diuretic. The typical BP profile is a SBP greatly exceeding DBP, manifested as an elevated pulse pressure (55 mmHg). Either the SBP or pulse pressure may be increased in hypervolemic/edematous individuals who must often be treated with diuretics. Proteinuria Evaluation for and quantitation of albuminuria/proteinuria is recommended when there is a family history of CKD or the eGFR is 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2. Achievement of target BP goals, particularly for the more important systolic pressure, will require two or more antihypertensive medications in most cases, if the initial SBP is (cid: 1)150 mmHg, two antihypertensive agents should be initiated, an anti-reninangiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS) drug such as an ACEI or ARB and either a diuretic (eg, thiazide or loop diuretic, the latter predicated by the GFR) or CCB (calcium channel blocker). Lastly, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (NDHPCCBs: diltiazem, 19 verapamil) are preferred in proteinuric CKD, with appropriate caution during concomitant beta blocker therapy, or with contraindication due to bradycardia. Proteinuria accelerates the rate of decline of GFR in hypertensive, diabetic, and non-diabetic individuals. Hypertension exacerbates proteinuria and promotes tubulointerstitial inflammation, fibrosis, and tubular atrophy, further elevating BP. Also, proteinuria, more specifically, albuminuria is an independent risk factor for stroke, LVH, and death. In the presence of 12 g/d proteinuria, the risk for progressive CKD rises steeply after SBP (cid: 2)130 mmHg. All of the antireninangiotensinaldosterone system (anti-RAAS) agents are anti-fibrogenic, including aldosterone receptor antagonists (ARAs). Patients with a SBP of 115130 mmHg and proteinuria 1 g/d have a relatively lower risk of progression.

All of the antireninangiotensinaldosterone system (anti-RAAS) agents are anti-fibrogenic, including aldosterone receptor antagonists (ARAs). Patients with a SBP of 115130 mmHg and proteinuria 1 g/d have a relatively lower risk of progression. However, a SBP of 120130 mmHg may be considered optimal for patients with HTN and proteinuria since SBPs (cid: 1)120 have been associated with an enhanced risk of adverse cardiovascular events in proteinuric CKD patients, particularly those with stroke or heart failure. Treatment The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC 7) issued a set of Compelling Indications (see TABLE) for the treatment of HTN, which should also be followed in CKD patients. Modification of lifestyle and dietary interventions should always be enforced in hypertensive CKD patients. Sodium restriction can produce substantial BP reductions, and primarily entails reducing the intake of salty processed foods. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support a SBP goal 130 mmHg in CKD with urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 0. 22. In patients with CKD and proteinuria that is 1 g/d, a SBP of 120130 mmHg is recommended. Overall, HTN control in CKD patients is suboptimal with less than one-half of patients achieving target BP levels. In the majority of such cases, the blood pressure regimen can be improved. JNC 7 COMPELLING INDICATIONS HYPERTENSION TREATMENT Indication Treatment Chronic kidney disease ACEI, ARB Diabetes mellitus ACEI, ARB, BB, CCB Heart failure ACEI, ARB, BB, ARA, thiazide High CAD risk ACEI, thiazide, BB, CCB Post-MI ACEI, BB, ARA Primary stroke prevention ARB (losartan, LIFE Trial) Secondary stroke prevention ACEI Abbreviations: ACEI, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; BB, beta blocker; CCB, calcium channel blocker; ARA, aldosterone receptor antagonist (epleronone, spironolactone).

Using UACR more reliably classifies individuals with higher risk CKD (ie, those who might develop progressive disease) who have been stratified into CKD Stages 3 and 4 by the MDRD 4variable eGFR equation. Using the combination of eGFR 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2 and proteinuria by UACR reduces the prevalence of CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients by 76%, from 16. 3 million to 3. 9 million. Note that UPC testing is not nationally standardized due to variation in laboratory methodology; however, UACR testing is standardized. The presence of even small amounts of albuminuria (10 mg/g) is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. While ACEI (angiotensin-convertingenzyme inhibitor) and/or ARB (angiotensin-receptor blocker) therapies reduce albuminuria and are associated with reduced risk for developing ESRD (especially in diabetes and hypertension), they are underutilized. Ideally, 70% or more of patients should be treated with these drugs. Types of Proteinuria Traditionally, normal urinary protein excretion is considered to be 150 mg/24-h; total urinary proteins measured are comprised of immunoglobulins, assorted globulins, and Tamm-Horsfall mucoprotein. Persistently elevated total urinary protein signifies: a) defect(s) in the glomerular basement membrane b) impaired tubular protein reabsorption, eg, tubulointerstitial nephritis c) increased filtration of low molecular weight protein(s), ie, overflow proteinuria as may occur with light chains. Persistent proteinuria is defined as two or more positive quantitative tests of protein excretion, separated by at least 2 weeks. Common, benign sources of albuminuria/proteinuria include orthostatic proteinuria, intense activity/exercise, and fever. Serious causes of proteinuria include glomerular disorders and myeloma. False positive albuminuria results by urine dipstick include highly alkaline urine, concentrated urine, gross hematuria and the presence of mucus, semen or white cells. Individuals at increased risk for CKD should undergo testing for proteinuria. The urinalysis dipstick may not register proteinuria when the urine is highly dilute, (ie, specific gravity (cid: 1)1. 015). In addition, the dipstick preferentially detects albumin, which is the major urinary protein excreted in proteinuric CKD disorders, eg, diabetes, glomerular disorders. 24 Evaluation of Proteinuria Early or first morning spot UPC ratio (urine protein and urine creatinine expressed as mg/dL) correlates with the daily protein excretion rate (g/24-h). A UPC 2 correlates with 2 g of proteinuria per 24-h and approximates the 24-h urine total protein collection, a collection fraught with error(s). Since the majority of protein excretion in glomerular disease is albumin, albuminspecific tests have been devised, eg, albumin-specific dipsticks and the UACR, traditionally classified as normal (30 mg/g), microalbuminuria (30300 mg/g) and macroalbuminuria (300 mg/g). Notably, a new classification system that eschews the terms microand macroalbuminuria may be established in the near future. Quantitative urinary protein (principally albuminuria) testing by UPC or UACR is recommended within 3 months of documentation of (cid: 1)1 proteinuria by dipstick analysis. Two or more positive quantitative tests, preferably on first morning urine specimens, should be documented before diagnosing persistent proteinuria (see CKD PROTEINURIA EVALUATION, P. 27). The urine dipstick favors albumin detection and is relatively insensitive for tubular proteinuria, eg, immunoglobulin light chains.

Two or more positive quantitative tests, preferably on first morning urine specimens, should be documented before diagnosing persistent proteinuria (see CKD PROTEINURIA EVALUATION, P. 27). The urine dipstick favors albumin detection and is relatively insensitive for tubular proteinuria, eg, immunoglobulin light chains. If tubular proteinuria is suspected, specific qualitative and quantitative examinations may be required, eg, serum free light chain analysis (Freelite) and serum and urine immunofixation. For screening purposes, a 24-h urine is unnecessary, but if a serum monoclonal protein is detected, a 24-h urine collection for immunofixation is indicated. Consultation with a clinical laboratory expert is advised to optimize diagnostic yield in such cases. Anti-Proteinuric Therapy Anti-proteinuric therapy reduces tubulointerstitial fibrosis and thus, progression of CKD. Patients with stable, persistent proteinuria of 1 g/24-h have a very small risk of progression to kidney failure compared to individuals with greater proteinuria. However, glomerular proteinuria in the nephrotic range (2 g/m2/d; 3. 03. 5 g/24-h in adults) has an ominous prognosis and is associated with edema, hypercholesterolemia, hypoalbuminemia, anemia, lipiduria, vitamin D deficiency, and greater risk for progression to ESRD. Irrespective of the degree of proteinuria, all therapies that reduce proteinuria should be optimized for BP control of 130/80 mmHg as tolerated. Anti-renin angiotensinaldosterone (RAAS) agents, ACEIs and ARBs, represent first-line anti-proteinuric drugs and should be utilized whenever possible. These agents are indicated in the treatment of diabetic and non-diabetic proteinuric CKD. Antihypertensive regimens that include anti-RAAS therapy are more efficacious than regimens that do not include ACEIs or ARBs, and their benefit is maximized in CKD patients that manifest either 0. 5 g/d of proteinuria, UPCs 0. 22, or microalbuminuria by UACR. The anti-RAAS therapies exert differential, beneficial effects on glomerular structural proteins, intraglomerular pressures, local and systemic sympathetic nervous systems, inflammatory pathways, and the systemic blood pressure. Notably, no specific agent reduces tubular proteinuria. Recently, aldosterone receptor antagonists (ARAs) and direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) have demonstrated anti-proteinuric properties. Non-dihydropyridine CCB (calcium channel blockers), diltiazem and verapamil, also reduce proteinuria and complement the anti-RAAS agents. Combinations of such agents (ACEI ARB) frequently reduce proteinuria by an additional 25 40%. However, dual-agent anti-RAAS therapies involving ACEIs or ARBs (VA NEPHRON-D) with other antiproteinuric agents, eg, (ACEI or ARB) ARA or (ACEI or ARB) DRI (ALTITUDE) should be initiated and monitored by a nephrologist. The goal of attaining target BP supersedes additional use of antiproteinuric agents. Recent data suggest that pentoxifylline and HMG-Co synthetase inhibitors, simvastatin and atorvastatin, may reduce proteinuria. 25 Finally, high sodium intake and poor glycemic control may retard BP-lowering and proteinuriareducing effects of antihypertensive agents. Sodium intake of (cid: 1)1500 mg daily is recommended for patients with CKD. Therapeutic Targets for Proteinuria Reduction UPC 0.

Anemia of CKD usually begins during CKD Stage 3, ie, GFRs 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2. Anemia occurs in 42%, 54% and 76% of CKD Stage 3, 4 and 5 patients, respectively, and is more severe in diabetics. Anemia multiplies the mortality risks of diabetes, heart failure, and CKD. Treatment of anemia of CKD is associated with improved vitality and socialization, but has not been shown to decrease LVH or cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Iron deficiency should be corrected before administration of any ESA (erythropoiesis stimulating agent). The KDOQI CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ANEMIA IN CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE: 2007 UPDATE OF HEMOGLOBIN TARGET states a Clinical Practice Recommendation for a Hb target of 11. 0 to 12. 0 g/dL and a top-level Hb of 13. 0 g/dL in CKD. To obtain reimbursement for ESA therapy, the Hb must be 10 g/dL on the date that an ESA is first prescribed, and reimbursement is dependent upon payors coverage policies. Lastly, an attestation of medical necessity for ESA treatment may be required for reimbursement by third party payors. Pathophysiology The primary reason for anemia in CKD is an absolute or relative deficiency of renal erythropoietin (EPO) synthesis. Individual sensitivity and responsiveness to an ESA is highly variable and dosing requirements are heterogeneous. Occult causes of blood loss and iron deficiency must be ruled out in all patients as a cause of hyporesponsivenss to ESA treatment. Less commonly, vitamin deficiencies, eg, B and folate, and inflammatory causes of ESA resistance should be ruled out 12 secondarily. Inflammation upregulates hepcidin, a liver-synthesized protein that reduces gut iron absorption and impedes iron release from the reticuloendothelial system to the developing erythron. Finally, effective iron delivery is required for optimal ESA-stimulated production of fully hemoglobinized red blood cells. Iron Deficiency Iron deficiency is common in CKD. CKD patients should be iron replete before initiating ESAs. To correct iron deficiency, oral iron should always be tried initially, and multiple iron salt preparations are available. However, to achieve iron repletion, parenteral iron may be required in non-dialysis CKD patients. Multiple studies attest to the safety of several parenteral iron preparations, including iron sucrose FDA-approved, ferumoxytol FDA-approved, and low molecular weight iron dextran used off label. 28 Safety During anemia treatment, Hb elevations of 12 g/dL per month are generally well tolerated. More rapid increments are not advised. Recent clinical trials describe an increased risk of blood clots, strokes, and heart attacks in CKD and dialysis patients, in association with treatment to Hb levels of 13 g/dL, particularly at high doses of ESA. FDA and ESA manufacturers have agreed to revised product labelings that include a black box warning with an FDA-approved target Hb of 1012 g/dL (see below). However, the heterogeneity of responses to ESA/iron-based anemia therapy among patients and even over time in the same patient makes the targeting of an exact Hb difficult. Lastly, ESA dosing has been extended to once monthly intervals in several clinical trials.

However, the heterogeneity of responses to ESA/iron-based anemia therapy among patients and even over time in the same patient makes the targeting of an exact Hb difficult. Lastly, ESA dosing has been extended to once monthly intervals in several clinical trials. Therapeutic Targets Hb 1012 g/dL (do not exceed Hb 13 g/dL) TSAT 20% but 50% Ferritin 100 ng/mL CHr 32 pg/cell Therapeutic phlebotomy should not be undertaken, if the Hb is 1318 g/dL, in the absence of ESA therapy, unless symptoms are present, eg, headache. Ferritin 800 ng/mL is not a contraindication to the use oral or parenteral iron; interpretation of clinical context and trend analysis of iron utilization is required, particularly with inflammation. CHr (mean cellular hemoglobin content of reticulocytes); utility of this parameter has only been validated in hemodialysis-dependent ESRD patients. Evaluation CBC, absolute reticulocyte ct, TSAT, ferritin, vitamin B, and folate levels. Always rule out other 12 causes of anemia, eg, malignancy, inflammatory conditions, vitamin D deficiency, and iron deficiency before starting an ESA. Monitor iron parameters and CBC twice monthly after initiating therapy or until Hb stabilizes within the target range, then monthly. Use the absolute reticulocyte count to assess efficacy. Treatment Iron Ferrous sulfate: 200 mg elemental iron/24-h (alternative, ferrous fumarate) Iron dextran (INFeD): 5001000 mg iv infusions of low molecular wt iron dextran Iron sucrose (Venofer): 100200 mg iv infusions in non-dialysis-dependent CKD Ferumoxytol (Feraheme): 5001000 mg iv in non-dialysis-dependent CKD Iron dextran, iv, high molecular weight (Dexferrum), is a distinct and separate product from INFeD (see above). Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESAs) Epoetin alfa (Procrit or Epogen): 1040, 000 Units, subcutaneously, q14 wk; begin therapy at Hb 10 g/dL at starting dose, 100 Units/kg/wk. Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp): 40300 mcg, subcutaneously, q24 wk or q1 mo; begin therapy at Hb 10 g/dL at starting dose, 0. 9 mcg/kg/q2 wk (equivalent to package insert dose, 0. 45 mcg/kg/wk) NB: ESA therapy entails informed consent at each administration. In hemodialysis patients, administration of vitamin D may reduce ESA utilization. 29 COMMENTS Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) should be co-administered with iron in achlorhydric patients (250 mg per iron tablet), during H antagonist or PPI therapy, or after gastric ulcer surgery (eg, 2 Billroth II surgery). Ca-based P-binders bind iron salts. Consult a nephrologist before initiating ESA treatment, if oral iron therapy does not achieve Hb (cid: 1)10 g/dL or if parenteral iron is considered. Dose conversion ratio of epoetin alfa to darbepoetin alfa is 225260 to 1. EPO levels should not be measured as part of a routine anemia evaluation. ESAs are contraindicated during acute blood loss. Iron salts should only be ingested on an empty stomach. Iron salts bind fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, Ca-based P-binders, and levothyroxine. Administer thyroid hormones separately from iron. Parenteral iron is contraindicated during active infection. REFERENCES 1. A Besarab, et al. J Am Soc Nephrol 10: 2029, 1999 2. T Ganz. Blood 102(3): 783, 2003 3. Toto RD, et al.

Ca, P, Parathyroid Hormone (PTH), and Vitamin D Physiology Total serum calcium is 40% ionized (free), 50% albumin-bound and 10% complexed to P and organic anions. Ionized Ca regulates the parathyroid gland (PTG) Ca-sensing receptor (CaR), vitamin D, and PTH. Low ionized Ca levels reduce CaR stimulation and increase PTH secretion, elevating ionized Ca and renal P excretion and calcitriol synthesis. An average daily dietary P intake is 8001400 mg, 80% of which is renally excreted via PTH action. In an individual with normal renal function, low P stimulates calcitriol independently leading to decreased PTH and increased gut absorption of P. Progressive CKD leads to progressive elevation in P; low P levels in a patient with significant CKD should lead to consideration of other additional underlying issues such as malnutrition. High P levels raise PTH and are associated with greater CVD and all-cause mortality. The traditional thought has been that increased P is one inciting factor in the development of SHPT and CKD-MBD, and goals of therapy have debated the maintenance of a 31 normal P range versus reduction to the normal range. Dietary P restriction is beneficial in early CKD, and renal dietary consultation may be sought at any CKD Stage. As CKD progresses, diet alone is likely to be an ineffective intervention to prevent or correct hyperphosphatemia. Currently, P binders remain a mainstay of therapy in patients with elevated levels. SHPT may develop in late CKD Stage 2. PTH levels are elevated in nearly one-third of CKD Stage 3 patients and may be increased despite normal Ca and P levels. Vitamin D as 25(OH)D deficiency is frequent in CKD and may further elevate PTH. In CKD Stage 4, hyperphosphatemia from renal P retention occurs. To prevent progressive PTG growth and PTH secretion as CKD worsens, screen for and begin treatment of SHPT early. Please note the developing story of Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23). Bone-derived FGF23 is one of an undefined number of circulating peptides known as phosphatonins. FGF23 acts on kidney proximal tubular cells and decreases P reabsorption, thereby increasing urinary P excretion. FGF-23 apparently directly suppresses PTH and decreases calcitriol synthesis by inhibiting proximal tubular 1α-OHase inhibition. FGF-23 is significantly elevated in CKD and is the subject of much current research aimed at determining its significance as a CKD biomarker or parameter of successful therapy, with other phosphatonins. Metabolic acidosis defined as a serum HCO 3 22 mEq/L that is not generated by respiratory alkalosis is under-recognized. Acidosis potentiates bone-lytic PTH effects, thereby increasing Ca and P bone resorption. It also increases SNS activity, aggravating hypertension, induces insulin resistance, and promotes muscle-protein catabolism. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate generally does not produce ECF volume expansion (eg, edema) or worsen HTN. If edema or BP elevation occurs, loop diuretic therapy is recommended. Once established, the treatment of metabolic acidosis should always be initiated with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO) or another alkali.

Once established, the treatment of metabolic acidosis should always be initiated with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO) or another alkali. 3 CALCIUM, PHOSPHORUS, PARATHYROID HORMONE, AND VITAMIN D ACTIONS Compound Source/Distribution Action Bone mineralization, (cid: 1)Ionized Ca Diet, bone resorption CaR activation (cid: 1)CaR stimulation Kidney, PTG, other (cid: 2) SHPT, (cid: 2) PTG growth Diet, renal P retention, bone (cid: 1)P (cid: 1) PTH, complexes Ca, (cid: 1)FGF23 resorption (cid: 1) ionized Ca, (cid: 1) P excretion (cid: 1)PTH PTG (cid: 1) calcitriol synthesis (cid: 1)PTH receptor Bone (osteoblast), kidney See PTH stimulation Endogenous synthesis; (cid: 2) SHPT, (cid: 1) gut Ca/P absorption (cid: 1)Vitamin D exogenous administration (cid: 1) kidney Ca absorption Bone, kidney, PTG, gut and other (cid: 1)VDR stimulation (cid: 2) PTH gene activity tissues Abbreviations: CaR, calcium-sensing receptor; PTG, parathyroid gland; SHPT, secondary hyperparathyroidism; P, serum phosphorus; VDR, vitamin D receptor. Vitamin D includes vitamins D2 and D3and three active D sterols, calcitriol, and two synthetic vitamin D2 compounds. Renal synthesis of calcitriol is tightly regulated. Its level does not reflect vitamin D sufficiency, which correlates better with 25(OH)D levels. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) stimulation by active vitamin D sterols suppresses PTH secretion, enhances gut Ca and P 32 absorption, and increases renal Ca reabsorption. As CKD worsens parathyroid VDR and CaR densities are reduced, aggravating SHPT (see TABLE).

Currently, 25(OH)D levels 30 ng/mL represent vitamin D insufficiency. However, these agents may not sufficiently suppress PTH elevations in CKD Stages 35, despite replenishing vitamin D stores. Consequently, active vitamin D sterols may be required to suppress PTH to target levels. Any of these compounds can be used concomitantly with vitamin D2 or D3. Oral vitamin D is recommended in CKD Stages 3 and 4, and active vitamin D sterols are recommended to prevent and treat early SHPT and CKD-MBD. Treatment (with active vitamin D sterols) is indicated when 25(OH)D levels are 30 ng/mL; Corrected calcium (Corr Ca) is 9. 5 mg/dL; P 4. 6 mg/dL; and PTH levels are elevated and continue to rise with time. The optimal PTH levels in CKD are unknown and likely vary with a number of factors, not limited to stage of CKD and race.

5 mg/dL; P 4. 6 mg/dL; and PTH levels are elevated and continue to rise with time. The optimal PTH levels in CKD are unknown and likely vary with a number of factors, not limited to stage of CKD and race. An iPTH range that is 29 (cid: 1) ULN (130600 pg/mL) may be acceptable, with the growing acceptance that therapy of mineral metabolism should be individualized, ie, trend analysis of the above parameters is favored over absolute values. Corr Ca (mg/dL) Total serum Ca 0. 8 (4 Albumin) Doxercalciferol, a vitamin D2 prohormone, requires hepatic hydroxylation for activation. Paricalcitol, a calcitriol analog, is active upon administration and does not require in vivo activation. Doxercalciferol and paricalcitol exert vitamin D-like actions and are less prone to induce hypercalcemia than calcitriol. Ca-based P-binders are recommended in CKD Stages 3 and 4 for P 4. 6 mg/dL when the corrected Ca is 10. 2 mg/dL and there is no evidence of coronary, peripheral vascular/cardiac valvular calcification. During Ca-based P-binder therapy, the total daily elemental Ca intake (dietary prescribed) should not exceed 2000 mg daily. This limit is imposed to prevent excessive Ca loading and extraskeletal calcification and dystrophic medial arterial calcification that occur earlier 33 in diabetes and CKD. Sevelamer hydrochloride, a non-metal anion exchange resin, and lanthanum carbonate are non-Ca-based P-binders. These agents may be used as initial P-binder therapy, if arterial/cardiac vascular calcification is present or, if the corrected Ca is 10. 2 mg/dL. These drugs do not alter Ca or PTH levels and do not affect treatment by vitamin D or its analogs. Sevelamer typically reduces LDL-C by 30% and raises HDL-C. Lastly, the Ca (cid: 2) P product as a therapeutic parameter is no longer used. KDIGO TARGETS FOR CKD-MINERAL AND BONE DISORDER CKD Ca P iPTH HCO 3 Stage (mg/dL) (mg/dL) (pg/mL) (mEq/L) 3 NL range NL range 29 (cid: 1) ULN 2226 4 NL range NL Range 29 (cid: 1) ULN 2226 Lower toward NL Lower toward NL 5 29 (cid: 1) ULN 2226 range range KDIGO: Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes, 2006. Trend analysis of each parameter is preferred over treatment(s) directed at absolute parameter levels. PTH levels of 130600 pg/mL roughly equal 29 (cid: 1) ULN. Serum calcium corrected to serum albumin of 4. 0 g/dL. Trend analysis of Ca, P, and intact PTH is recommended rather than treatment of isolated values. Evaluation Ca, P, iPTH Every 2 wk initially in CKD Stages 34 until normalized, then every 312 mo depending on stage and trends Serum HCO Every 14 mo, depending on degree of metabolic acidosis 3 25(OH)D 30 ng/mL at initial evaluation; begin therapy, then repeat level every 3 mo until (cid: 1)30 ng/mL; subsequent levels are evaluated depending on CKD stage and levels.

Treatment plan includes periodic monitoring of Ca, P, albumin and PTH (see ACTION PLAN) and rarely induces Ca or P elevations that warrant their discontinuation. Active vitamin D sterols: may co-administer with ergocalciferol, if SHPT is present because ergocalciferol rarely suppresses PTH to target levels. Active vitamin D sterols: initiate during CKD Stages 34, if Ca 9. 5 mg/dL, P 4. 6 mg/dL, and PTH greater than target range. Ergocalciferol: consider in CKD Stages 3 and 4, if corrected Ca 9. 5 mg/dL, P 4. 6 mg/dL, PTH elevated, and 25(OH)D 30 ng/mL. Refer to the MEDICATION RELATED PROBLEMS IN CKD section for FDA-regulated labeling of the recommended doses of these agents in CKD. The lack of evidence supporting a definitive goal PTH and a clearcut therapeutic regimen makes this area controversial. Consequently, drug manufacturer labeling may differ from recommendations from consensus organizations such as KDIGO and from the practices of experts in the field. Recommended guidelines should not substitute for clinical judgment. Due to the absence of definitive evidence, any treatment plan should include periodic monitoring of Ca, P, albumin, and PTH (see ACTION PLAN), with therapy based on trend analysis. Only rarely should a single abnormal value of Ca or P warrant discontinuation of active vitamin D sterols.

Two large trials (4D and AURORA) in ESRD patients demonstrated no cardiovascular or mortality benefits. A recent large, randomized controlled trial (SHARP) of CKD patients treated by simvastatin/ezetimibe demonstrated a positive effect of LDL-Clowering therapy in non-dialysisdependent CKD (eGFR, 27 mL/min/1. 73 m2) and ESRD patients. Major atherosclerotic events (combination of non-fatal MI, coronary death, ischemic stroke, or any revascularization event) were reduced by 17% compared to placebo. There was no effect on reducing the progression of CKD. Lipid-Lowering Strategies Lipid-lowering therapy in CKD is recommended, if TGs 200 mg/dL and/or LDL-C 100 mg/dL after 3 months of therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC). Lipid evaluation should be conducted at initial evaluation, 23 months after treatment changes, and at least, annually afterward. Treatment goals are equivalent to ATP III criteria for CHD and/or diabetes. LDL-C should be lowered to 100 mg/dL, with an optional, more aggressive goal of 70 mg/dL. Statins are first-line therapy in CKD patients with elevated LDL-C, but there is no preferred agent. Ezetimibe may be added to statin therapy. Bile acid sequestrants and niacin may be used, if statins cannot be used. Lastly, the target for combined dyslipidemia in CKD (TGs 200 mg/dL; non-HDL-C (cid: 1)130 mg/dL) is a nonHDL-C 130 mg/dL (see CKD DYSLIPIDEMIA TREATMENT). Gemfibrozil is considered the fibric acid derivative (fibrates) of choice for CKD patients with elevated TGs. Fibrates must be administered cautiously with statins in CKD to avoid hepatic toxicity or myopathy. However, there is no evidence that statins induce a greater incidence of rhabdomyolysis in CKD patients, compared to the general population. Muscle pain from statin therapy is genetically predisposed and is not an effect of CKD. 40 Therapeutic Targets TG 150 mg/dL LDL-C 70100 mg/dL (diabetes: optional goal is 70 mg/dL) Non-HDL-C (cid: 1)130 mg/dL ( Total-C HDL-C) Evaluation TG, LDL-C Every 23 mo until treatment goal achieved, then every 612 mo Non-HDL-C Every 23 mo until treatment goal achieved, then every 612 mo Treatment Statin Dose that reduces LDL-C to (cid: 1)70100 mg/dL Gemfibrozil Limit to 300 mg twice daily for GFR 50 mL/min/1. 73 m2 COMMENTS Baseline hepatic transaminase levels should be determined before initiating statin therapy, after 23 months of treatment and periodically afterward. Bile acid sequestrants are contraindicated, if TGs are 400mg/dl. CKD dose adjustments: atorvastatin and pravastatin do not require dose adjustments. It is unknown, if dose adjustments are required for simvastatin and fluvastatin. Lovastatin: a 50% dose reduction recommended, if GFR 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2. Ezetimibe (Zetia): a cholesterol absorption inhibitor may be substituted, if statin therapy is not tolerated. Ezetimibe requires no dose adjustment at any level of CKD. Ezetimibe or colesevelam may be used to reduce statin doses, ie, potential benefit from using multiple low doses of drugs instead of a single high dose in CKD. Colesevelam is contraindicated, if TGs are increased. Non-HDL-C may be evaluated in the non-fasting state.

Cristina Kilates Introduction Malnutrition evolves during the progression of CKD with electrolyte abnormalities, muscle mass reduction, and depressed immunological function. These problems are compounded by anorexia that often accompanies advanced CKD and poor food choice(s), ie, lack of high biological value protein. Hypoalbuminemia and related nutritional disorders, including vitamin and mineral deficiencies are common. Preventing malnutrition through periodic visits to a trained renal nutritionist for nutrition surveillance is recommended and may avert complications. Protein Intake High biological value protein intake should be maintained, while sodium, potassium, and phosphorus intake are restricted. Protein targets vary depending on CKD Stage (see NUTRITIONAL TARGETS FOR CKD). A controlled protein diet slows the decline of kidney function more than one with more liberal protein intake. Fluid restriction should only be instituted, if hyponatremia is present. The reduction of sodium and phosphate intake is much more important than restricting fluid intake, unless there is hyponatremia (S Na 130 mEq/L). Monitoring A 24-h urine collection for sodium (goal 100 mEq Na per 24-h), urea nitrogen and creatinine is highly informative regarding the level of compliance with a dietary prescription. To preserve lean body mass, a supervised exercise regimen should be considered in conjunction with dietary recommendations. Patients with high BP are advised to follow a DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, which has proven efficacy. Modification of a DASH diet will be required in CKD patients because of its high potassium and phosphate contents. Lastly, patients with proteinuria at any stage of CKD should be referred to a Renal Dietitian/Nutritionist.

Nonetheless, CKD patients are immunized less frequently against influenza virus and S. pneumoniae than the general population. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines may be co-administered. CKD patients should receive the following immunizations: a) Trivalent, inactivated influenza A/B (TIV) vaccine b) 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal (Pneumovax, PPV23) vaccine c) Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine Hepatitis B Virus HBV vaccination is advised in patients with progressive CKD, and immunization in CKD Stage 4, pre-ESRD, is recommended because late Stage 5 vaccination produces lesser rates of seroconversion. In CKD Stage 5, antigen presenting cell and CD4 cell defects occur. HBVantibody responses to HBV are less intense and less durable. Immunocompetence, measured by achievement of an antibody titer 10 mIU/mL, occurs in just 5070% of ESRD patients. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive patients can be safely immunized against HBV. Lastly, booster vaccinations with tetanus toxoid, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccines (Tdap) may be administered alone or co-administered with any of the vaccines listed below.

Special formulation (Recombivax HB Dialysis Formulation) COMMENTS HBV immunization: evaluate antibody titer 2 mo after last dose. If antibody titer 10 mIU/mL, repeat entire dosing series and determine antibody response after 14 mo. Combined hepatitis A/B vaccine (Twinrix) may be administered as a 3-dose series: 0, 1, and 6 mo. Healthcare workers who demonstrate an initial response to HBV immunization may be considered for a single booster dose after 5 years (Not FDA or NKF guideline). 45 Influenza Virus United States Renal Data System data revealed that Medicare patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were 5. 4 times more likely to receive an influenza vaccine versus employer group health plan patients with CKD (43% v 8%). The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality advocates that CKD patients be vaccinated yearly in order to decrease morbidity and mortality related to influenza. TIV immunization is now comprised of 2 A one is H1N1 and 1 B virus strains and may be co-administered with pneumococcal vaccine. CKD/ESRD patients at risk for hepatitis A (eg, chronic liver disease, HCV, HIV, multiple sexual partners, homosexual males, and iv drug users) should be vaccinated with Hepatitis A vaccines (Havrix and Zaqta). Varicella zoster Varicella zoster (VZ) re-activation or infection may be precipitated by the immunosuppression that follows organ transplantation. VZ immunization is available as two live, attenuated virus vaccines (Zostavax, Varivax). These may be administered in CKD patients. Patients undergoing consideration as organ transplant recipients should, where applicable, receive VZ immunizations pre-transplantation. Vaccines FDA-approved vaccines that are commonly administered to CKD patients are briefly described below. S. pneumoniae Pneumovax 23 Single 0. 5-mL (25 mcg) IM (deltoid) injection. Alternative: subcutaneous injection is permitted. Revaccination with a single dose may be considered 5 years after the last dose in persons (cid: 1)65 y. o. who were 65 y. o. at the time of initial vaccination. Tetanus, diphtheria (Td); Tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) Td Dose 1 of initial series: 0. 5-mL IM injection, upper arm Doses 2 and 3: 48 wk between doses 1 and 2 and 612 mo between doses 2 and 3 Booster doses: 0. 5-mL IM injection every 10 years after initial series Tdap One dose is recommended for ages 1964 y. o. Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine TIV Single annual dose IM 46 COMMENTS Intranasal live, attenuated influenza virus vaccine (FluMist) is not FDA-approved for CKD patients. Oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) neuraminidase inhibitors are not FDA-approved for CKD patients. HBV vaccines are contraindicated in persons with yeast allergy.

KDIGO Guideline: Available at URL: Accessed 01/08/2011 47 KIDNEY REPLACEMENT THERAPY by Jariatul Karim Lalathaksha Kumbar Introduction Anticipation of the need to initiate kidney replacement therapy (KRT) is paramount. Nearly 43% of CKD Stage5/ESRD patients have no pre-ESRD evaluation by a nephrologist and often begin KRT in-hospital via a hemodialysis (HD) catheter. In these cases, healthcare expenditures during the initial 3 months of ESRD therapy increase by an average of 30, 000 per patient. To prevent this untoward clinical scenario, advanced CKD Stage 4 patients should be referred to a vascular access surgeon at eGFR 20 mL/min/1. 73 m2 for timely planning of appropriate HD vascular access or peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter placement. In the US, lack of timely (early) vascular access planning, type of medical care prior to onset of ESRD, and socioeconomic factors result in a disproportionately high proportion of patients beginning KRT with in-hospital HD via temporary, non-tunneled, non-cuffed HD catheters that are associated with significant and costly morbidity (infections, venous stenosis) and mortality. To offset this trend, in 1997 the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended earlier referral of CKD patients to nephrologists to facilitate vascular access evaluation and construction to optimize clinical outcomes and costs. Timing of Kidney Replacement Therapy The decision to treat patients with CKD by KRT as kidney transplantation, peritoneal dialysis, or hemodialysis should be made collaboratively by patients and their healthcare team. KRT is an expensive government entitlement program: minimum annual per patient cost, 36, 000; annual average cost 77, 000. Recent data reveal that starting KRT early does not increase patient survival. Although CKD Stage 5 begins at eGFR 15 mL/min/1. 73 m2, KRT does not have to begin then, if the patient is well. The number of comorbidities that a patient has must be taken into consideration before initiating KRT. Patients 75 y. o. , particularly, if male, with multiple comorbidities managed conservatively fare just as well as those on dialysis because death versus dialysis is a competing survival risk. Therefore, conservative management, when chosen, focuses the shift from simply attempting to prolong life to providing quality of life and alleviation of symptoms. This includes optimization of all parameters associated with CKD care (see CHECKLIST).

Therefore, conservative management, when chosen, focuses the shift from simply attempting to prolong life to providing quality of life and alleviation of symptoms. This includes optimization of all parameters associated with CKD care (see CHECKLIST). Education An informed patient fares better than the non-informed one. CKD education entails information of various kidney replacement therapies: transplantation, PD, in-center HD, and home HD. Physical conditions such as vision and manual dexterity, motivational level to actively participate in care, and family/social circumstances all play roles in the decision-making process. CKD educational materials are widely distributed over the Internet. Patient advocacy groups have authored numerous, helpful informational materials written at an appropriate reading level (see CKD WEBSITES OF INTEREST). When adequately informed about ESRD modalities, 38% of CKD Stage 5 patients choose PD in comparison to 5% of patients who had not received more intensive ESRDmodality training. The provision of dedicated CKD education classes for patients and families, in conjunction with CKD clinics, has resulted in improved clinical outcomes, particularly in ESRD-modality training, vascular access placement, BP control, and anemia of CKD. 48 Peritoneal Dialysis Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a viable option for most ESRD patients; however, it was chosen by just 10. 9% of ESRD patients who began ESRD care between 2005 and 2007. Peritoneal dialysis as a modality option was discussed with 61% of patients before initiation of dialysis. Instillation of a hypertonic glucose-containing solution via a trans-abdominal PD catheter provides uremic solute (diffusion) and excess sodium and water removal (convection). PD catheters should be implanted at least 4 weeks prior to the date of their anticipated use. BP and P control are superior with PD compared to conventional HD. PD involves diffusion of uremic solutes and electrolytes from capillaries lining the peritoneal membranes into the externally infused dialysate. The continual nature of PD is suited for heart failure patients and/or volume-dependent HTN. Contraindications to PD include extreme obesity, multiple abdominal surgeries, and recurrent peritonitis. Complications of PD catheters include peritonitis, catheter malfunction, and failure of PD due to membrane loss/fibrosis. Peritonitis can be treated with intra-peritoneal or iv antibiotics and may require catheter exchange. Catheter removal is absolutely indicated when pseudomonal, MRSA, or fungal peritonitis occurs. Hemodialysis About 92% of the incident dialysis patients in the United States undergo conventional HD, typically carried out thrice-weekly in a designated HD unit, ie, in-center dialysis, with typical treatment times of 34 h. Some centers offer nocturnal HD where patients sleep during treatment by slow, low-efficiency dialysis. Home HD is conducted in the home environment, 56 sessions weekly for 2. 53 h. Control of BP and phosphorus are superior with PD, nocturnal PD, and home HD compared to conventional thrice-weekly HD. Optimal HD requires a well-functioning vascular access and this can be provided via an autogenous AVF (arteriovenous fistulas), bioprosthetic AVG (arteriovenous grafts), or HD catheters.

Such adverse effects may occur in the context of AKI/ARF or in CKD. Caution is warranted when using any of the listed agents in CKD. Alternative therapies should be explored in each clinical circumstance and the risk-to-benefit ratio of any agent must be determined by the prescribing individual. The clinician is advised to determine all medications that require dose adjustments based upon GFR in steady-state conditions. Pharmacy consultation is advised to optimize drug dosing, particularly in cases of acute kidney injury. Acute Kidney Injury / Acute Renal Failure Azotemia: exenatide (Byetta) has been associated with AKI. Crystalluric tubular damage: acyclovir (Zovirax), indinavir (Crixivan), sulfadiazine, triamterene, triamterene/HCTZ combinations (Dyazide, Maxzide), topiramate (Topamax), and orlistat (Xenical). Decreased creatinine secretion: trimethoprim (Proloprim, Bactrim, Septra, Sulfatrim, Polyprim), probenecid (Benemid), spironolactone (Aldactone), amiloride (Midamor), triamterene (Dyrenium), pyrimethamine (Daraprim), salicylates, and cimetidine (Tagamet). GFR is not reduced, although eGFR will be lowered; BUN does not change. Decreased GFR: ACEIs and ARBs reduce efferent arteriolar resistance. ARBs produce less SCr elevations than ACEIs. Intratubular CaP precipitation: oral sodium phosphate solutions (OSPS) may induce AKI in CKD patients via intratubular calcium-phosphate precipitation with nephrocalcinosis and are contraindicated in CKD patients. OSPS include Visicoland Osmo-Prep. Intrarenal vasoconstriction with decreased GFR: NSAIDs, COX-1/-2, selective COX-2 inhibitors, and calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs, eg, cyclosporine, tacrolimus) may reduce GFR, promote sodium retention (edema), and aggravate hyperkalemia. Long-term use of CNIs can result in nephrotoxicity in 2560% of patients and is often associated with elevated blood concentrations underscoring the importance of monitoring CNI blood levels. Tubulointerstitial nephritis (Interstitial nephritis): This disorder may represent 917% of cases of in-hospital ARF and is often the etiology of AKI/ARF of unknown origin. The most common sign of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis is hematuria, although classically, leukocyte casts are associated with this disorder. Microscopic evaluation of the urine should be used to confirm this often missed disorder. Allergic antibiotic-associated interstitial nephritis is common. Lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid) is associated with tubulointerstitial nephritis and in some cases, nephrotic syndrome. Idiosyncratic reactions to NSAIDs may induce immune-mediated acute or chronic interstitial nephritis. 51 Idiosyncratic reactions to NSAIDs may induce interstitial nephritis, typically in association with minimal change disease and heavy proteinuria (see above). Acute interstitial nephritis that has not improved within 24 weeks, following withdrawal of the offending agent, may be empirically treated with a 30-d course of glucocorticoid steroids. Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN): prophylactic volume expansion with sodium chlorideor sodium bicarbonate-based solutions reduces the incidence of AKI in non-edematous, stable CKD patients. Stage 35 patients (GFR 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2), with or without diabetes. Saline: Isotonic (normal) saline or isotonic sodium bicarbonate prophylaxis is recommended for non-diabetic and diabetic CKD patients. Hospitalized, non-edematous, hemodynamically stable CKD patients should receive an infusion of isotonic sodium bicarbonate or 0. 9% saline at 1 mL/kg bodyweight for up to 12 h before, during and 12 h after contrast administration. Drugs: stop diuretics (if feasible), NSAIDs, and metformin 48 h pre-contrast delivery.

Hospitalized, non-edematous, hemodynamically stable CKD patients should receive an infusion of isotonic sodium bicarbonate or 0. 9% saline at 1 mL/kg bodyweight for up to 12 h before, during and 12 h after contrast administration. Drugs: stop diuretics (if feasible), NSAIDs, and metformin 48 h pre-contrast delivery. Radiocontrast medium: isosmolal radiocontrast (iodixanol, Visipaque, 290 mOsm/kg) has reduced the risk of AKI/ARF in higher risk patients, ie, diabetes. Diabetes: glycemic control should be achieved prior to acute contrast delivery, eg, serum glucose 150 mg/dL. N-acetylcysteine (NAC): this agent has not been definitively proven to reduce the risk of developing radiocontrast-induced nephropathy. If used, administer 1200 mg po q-12 h for 4 doses: 1200 mg 13 h pre-contrast administration, 1200 mg 1 h pre-contrast and 1200 mg twice daily following contrast administration. Dialysis: dialysis/hemofiltration is not recommended as prophylaxis. ACEI or ARB therapy: withdrawal pre-contrast administration may be beneficial. Gadolinium (Gd): Gd-based contrast agent (GABCA) procedures, eg, MRI/MRA, are rarely associated with AKI. However, Gd-chelates used for MRI contrast enhancement, are associated with a fibrotic skin disorder, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) that may also involve visceral organs. The risk of developing NSF is estimated at 14% in advanced CKD. Alternatives to Gdbased imaging studies should be aggressively sought in CKD Stages 4 and 5 and ESRD patients. Three GBCA, gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist), gadodiamide (Omniscan), and gadoversetamide (Optimark) are contraindicated for patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) or severe CKD because NSF risk is deemed higher in these individuals. 4 GBCAs that are approved for MRIs carry new labeling explicitly warning of the risk of NSF associated with GBCA: gadofosveset trisodium (Ablavar, Vasovist); gadoxetate disodium (Eovist); gadobenate dimeglumine (Multihance); and gadoteridol (Prohance). Clinicians are advised to screen for AKI or severe CKD before GBCA administration and to monitor kidney function post-receipt of Gd-chelates. Serial hemodialyses to remove GBCA rapidly may be required in CKD Stages 4 and 5 patients and ESRD patients. NB: Gadodiamide and gadoversetamide may cause spurious hypocalcemia by interfering with total serum calcium assays. Avoid Ca measurements for several hours post-GBCA administration. 52 Hyperkalemia Decreased cellular K uptake: α/β blockers, eg, labetalol (Trandate, Normodyne) and nonselective β-adrenergic blocking agents, eg, propranolol (Inderal, Inderal LA). Decreased renal K secretion: Anti-RAAS therapy with ACEIs and ARBs: ARBs produce less severe K elevations and reduce GFR less than ACEIs. Decreased distal nephron K secretion: Amiloride (Midamor), pentamidine (Pentam-300, Pentacarinat), triamterene (Dyrenium) and triamterene/HCTZ combinations (Dyazide, Maxzide), trimethoprim (Proloprim) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole combinations (Bactrim, Septra, Sulfatrim, Polyprim). Interference with prostaglandin metabolism: NSAIDs, COX-1/-2 and selective COX-2 inhibitors decrease renal K secretion by interfering with prostaglandin metabolism, which produces intrarenal vasoconstriction. ARAs: Spironolactone (Aldactone) and epleronone (Inspra). High K-containing foods: Patients should be counseled on the avoidance of high-K containing foods (see NUTRITION IN CKD). COMMENTS Renal dietary consultation is advised for persistent hyperkalemia (K 5. 5 mEq/L) and/or when polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexelate) is considered for treatment of hyperkalemia. The routine use of polystyrene sulfonate is not recommended.

COMMENTS Renal dietary consultation is advised for persistent hyperkalemia (K 5. 5 mEq/L) and/or when polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexelate) is considered for treatment of hyperkalemia. The routine use of polystyrene sulfonate is not recommended. Rule out pseudohyperkalemia from elevated platelet counts, eg, 750, 000 plt/mm3, severe leukocytosis, eg, 50, 000 WBC/mm3, or most commonly, prolonged tourniquet time, before treating hyperkalemia. Consult Nephrology prior to initiating hyperkalemia therapy with polystyrene sulfonate (this compound may cause bowel perforation/necrosis). Mild hyperkalemia (K, 5. 05. 5 mEq/L) usually requires no treatment, and dietary potassium restriction is the primary therapy. Diabetic Kidney Disease Hypoglycemia: CKD decreases renal elimination of the active moiety or metabolite(s) of certain agents, thereby increasing the risk for hypoglycemia. The following agents may require dose reductions. Insulin is eliminated/metabolized by the kidney often requiring a dose reduction of insulin of 2550%. Meglitinides: nateglinide (Starlix) requires no dose adjustment in CKD, but repaglinide (Prandin) does require dose adjustment in CKD. Sulfonylureas: glipizide (Glucotrol), glyburide (Diabeta, Micronase); Glipizide is preferred in CKD as it lacks active metabolites (glyburide has active renally eliminated metabolites). Other: sulfonamide antibiotics, quinine, disopyramide, and gabapentin (Neurontin). 53 Fluid retention/Heart failure exacerbation: thiazolidinediones, eg, pioglitazone (Actos), rosiglitazone (Avandia) should be used cautiously in CKD. Other: DPP-IV inhibitors, eg, sitagliptin (Januvia) and saxagliptin (Onglyza) have a low-risk for hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin requires dose-adjustment in CKD. Metformin is generally contraindicated in moderate to severe CKD (see below). COMMENTS (cid: 1)-glucosidase inhibitors: acarbose (Precose) and miglitol (Glyset) do not cause hypoglycemia, but are not recommended for eGFR 25 mL/min/1. 73 m2 GLP-1 receptor agonists: exenatide (Byetta) is contraindicated for eGFR 30 mL/min/1. 73 m2; liraglutide (Victoza) may be preferred as it requires no dose adjustment in CKD. Metabolic Acidosis Bicarbonate loss in urine: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, eg, glaucoma therapy drugs: dorzolamide (Trusopt), dorzolamide/timolol (Cosopt), and brinzolamide (Azopt). Acetazolamide (Diamox) and methazolamide (Neptazane) dosages should be reduced in CKD and are ineffective at GFR 10 mL/min/1. 73 m2. Lactic acidosis: metformin hydrochloride (Glucophage XR, Fortamet, Riomet), and metformin-containing drug combinations: glyburide/metformin (Glucovance), glipizide/metformin (Metaglip), rosiglitazone/metformin (Avandamet), saxigliptin/metformin (Kombiglyze XR). Metformin is contraindicated, if GFR 50 mL/min/1. 73 m2, ie, SCr (cid: 1)1. 5 mg/dL in males or 1. 4 mg/dL in females in CKD or AKI. Stop metformin before iodinated radiocontrast delivery and hold for 48 h post-procedure. Restart drug after kidney function returns to baseline. Mitochondrial damage: nucleoside analogs, eg, zalcitabine (ddC, Hivid), didanosine (ddI, Videx), stavudine (d4T, Zerit), lamivudine (3TC, Epivir), abacavir (Ziagen), and tenofovir (TDF, Viread), alone or in combination with other anti-HIV drugs. 54 Neurotoxicity Extrapyramidal side effects: metoclopramide (Reglan) should be reduced by 2550% in CKD Stages 35 and only used short-term. Mental status changes/Neurotoxicity/Seizures: Acyclovir (Zovirax) and valacyclovir (Valtrex) should undergo total daily dose reductions of 5075% in CKD Stages 35. Cefipime (Maxipime): reduce total daily dose by 50% in CKD Stages 4 and 5. Meperidine hydrochloride (Demerol) metabolite, nor-meperidine, accumulates and can induce seizures; contraindicated in advanced CKD.

Limit duration of use to 6 consecutive months. Nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin): absolute contraindication in CKD Stages 4 and 5 due to risk of irreversible peripheral neuropathy. Hepatotoxicity Hypersensitivity (DRESS syndrome): This syndrome usually develops 24 weeks after initiation of treatment with allopurinol when standard dosages (20400 mg/day) are administered to patients with CKD. Allopurinol (Zyloprim) should generally not be administered at total daily doses exceeding 200 mg in CKD Stages 35. Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms 55 SELECTED AGENTS by Carol Moore Introduction A list of agents commonly used in CKD care follows, grouped by drug class. Alkali (Base) Therapy Sodium bicarbonate Indication: Alkali replacement therapy in CKD to prevent protein wasting, decrease bone demineralization, and increase vitamin D synthesis. Tablet: 325 mg (3. 87 mEq HCO) and 650 mg (179 mg Na; 7. 74 mEq HCO). 3 3 Initiate therapy, if HCO 3 22 mEq/L on two occasions, separated by (cid: 1)2 wk. CKD: 2346 mEq/d in 23 divided doses to provide 0. 52. 0 mEq HCO /kg/d to attain target 3 serum HCO 2226 mEq/L. 3 Do not co-administer with Ca-based P-binders or iron salts. Consult Nephrology, if HCO 3 22 mEq/L or NaHCO 3 therapy 46 mEq/d. Baking Soda Indication: Alkali replacement therapy in CKD to prevent protein wasting, decrease bone demineralization, and increase vitamin D synthesis. 1 tsp: 500 mg Na, 23 mEq HCO (3, 650-mg NaHCO tablets) 3 3 Initiate therapy, if HCO 3 22 mEq/L on two occasions, separated by (cid: 1)2 wk. CKD: 23 divided doses totaling 0. 52. 0 mEq HCO/kg/d to attain target HCO of 2226 mEq/L. 3 3 Do not co-administer with Ca-based P-binders or iron salts. Consult Nephrology, if HCO 3 22 mEq/L or NaHCO 3 therapy 46 mEq/d. Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESAs) Begin ESA treatment of Anemia of CKD at Hb 10 g/dL, if there is no iron deficiency. The FDA target Hb range is 1012 g/dL. Iron stores should be replenished prior to initiation of therapy with an ESA. Consult a nephrologist for assistance in ESA dosing. The conversion rate of epoetin alfa to darbepoetin is 225260 Units of epoetin alfa to 1 mcg darbepoetin alfa. Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp) Indication: Anemia of CKD; begin therapy at Hb 10 g/dL Single-dose vial: 25, 40, 60, 100, 150, 200, 300, and 500 mcg CKD: 40100 mcg subcutaneously every 14 wk (0. 45 mcg/kg/q wk) Therapy is initiated weekly and may be extended to longer intervals when Hb is stabilized. Consult nephrologist for assistance in appropriate dosing.

PACKAGE INSERT: 56 Iron Therapy (on empty stomach) Iron therapy may be initiated at any level of hemoglobin. The degree and mode of replenishment depend on the degree of deficiency and tolerability of the patient to oral iron or iv iron therapies. Iron should be administered to replenish and maintain iron stores to the following levels: TSAT 20% and ferritin 100 ng/mL in CKD Stages 35 (ESRD: 200 ng/mL). Consult a nephrologist for assistance in appropriate dosing of parenteral iron and ESAs, which should not be initiated until the Hb is 10 g/dL. Oral formulations These agents should only be taken on an empty stomach. Take oral iron 2 h before or 4 h after antacids and at least 1 h after thyroid hormone. When effective at replenishing and maintaining iron stores, oral iron formulations are preferred in non-dialysis CKD patients. However, oral iron agents are tolerated poorly by many patients and also, the dose required to replenish iron stores is often greater than can be delivered in a timely fashion, thus necessitating parenteral iron. ESRD patients on chronic HD receive iv iron at HD and should not receive concomitant oral iron products. Any iron preparation, oral or iv, may be concurrently administered with an ESA. Ferrous sulfate Indication: Iron replacement and repletion therapy in CKD. Oral and liquid preparations with 100325 mg ferrous sulfate (20% elemental iron). CKD: typical dose is 12, 325 mg ferrous sulfate tablets, 3 times daily. Ferrous fumarate Indication: Iron replacement and repletion therapy in CKD.

COMMENTS Do not take Ca-based P-binders with iron salts or NaHCO 3. Calcium carbonate is not FDA-approved for use as a P-binder. Dietary and prescribed elemental Ca should not exceed 2000 mg daily. Ca-based binders should not be initiated in those with a Ca 10. 2 mg/dl or where there is evidence of vascular calcification. Consult Nephrology, if prescribed elemental Ca 1500 mg, Corr Ca 10. 2 mg/dL, or P 4. 6 mg/dL. Vitamin D Rationale for vitamin D treatment in CKD is to replenish vitamin D stores, not to suppress PTH. Ergocalciferol (D2 Calciferol, Drisdol); Indication: Nutritional vitamin D deficiency, eg, 25(OH)D level 30 ng/mL Softgel: 1. 25 mg (50, 000 IU) CKD: 50, 000 IU once weekly 4 and once monthly 8, if 25(OH)D 15 ng/mL and 50, 000 IU once monthly 6, if 25(OH)D is 1530 ng/mL unless Corr Ca is 9. 5 g/dL and/or P 4. 6 mg/dL. Note, longer durations of weekly vitamin D therapy may be required. Monitor levels every 3 mo, then continue once weekly or monthly dosing as determined by clinical circumstances and vitamin D levels. 59 Cholecalciferol (D3) Indication: Nutritional vitamin D deficiency, eg, 25(OH)D level 30 ng/mL, Tablet: 1000 IU, 2000 IU, 1750 IU or Softgel: 1000 IU, 2000 IU, and 5000 IU, Renally formulated vitamin preparation (Vital-D-Rx) contains 1750 IU cholecalciferol. CKD: 17505000 IU once daily. Vitamin D3 1750 IU once daily (cid: 1) Vitamin D2 50, 000 IU monthly). Active Vitamin D Sterols Active vitamin D sterols should only be initiated when 25(OH)D level is 30 ng/mL, with elevated iPTH. Consult nephrologist, if PTH remains elevated after 3 months of therapy. In CKD, vitamin D has rarely caused hypercalcemia at recommended doses. ESRD patients generally receive active vitamin D sterols (see Comments, p. 35).

Coding should be applied as specifically as possible, with appropriate utilization of 4th and 5th digits. For example, codes are specific for types 1 and 2 diabetes and their complications. Diabetic complications are assigned 4th digits (250. x), and the degree of glycemic control is assigned a 5th digit (250. xx). Diagnoses of electrolyte disorders should be completely spelled out, ie, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia must not be documented with shorthand forms or symbols: hyponatremia must be used instead of Na and hyperkalemia must be used instead of K. Lastly, symptoms and signs of CKD also have specific codes, eg, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia, tenesmus, etc. 63 CKD Codes ICD-9-CM codes for CKD have been reclassified and parallel clinical stratification of CKD. Before 3 months, use the ARF code. After 3 months of kidney disease, a CKD Stage-specific code should be used. The invalid Code 585 has been replaced by CKD Stage-specific codes, 585. 1585. 6 and 585. 9 (see Tables). Specifically, code 585. 5 denotes CKD Stage 5, but not ESRD (585. 6) or CKD, unspecified (585. 9). If CKD results from systemic illness, that disorder is coded first. For example, a hypertensive SLE patient with diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis of 5 months duration and laboratory findings: SCr 2. 5 mg/dL, GFR 43 mL/min/1. 73 m2, BP 153/90 mmHg, iPTH 220 pg/mL, 25(OH)D 18 ng/mL, Hct 29%, and UPC 5. 3, is coded as follows. Systemic disorder: SLE (710. 0); Etiology, proliferative glomerulonephritis (581. 0) and CKD Stage 3 (585. 3). Complications: benign HTN of CKD (403. 1x), secondary hyperparathyroidism of renal origin (588. 81), hypovitaminosis D, unspecified (268. 9), anemia of CKD (285. 21), and proteinuria (791. 0). Hypertension Codes Codes for HTN are grouped as 401405. When documenting HTN, the adjective benign or malignant should always precede the diagnosis of HTN. Primary (essential or benign) HTN without CKD is coded 401. 9. However, if high BP is the cause of CKD, benign HTN of CKD often termed hypertensive nephrosclerosis (403. 1x) is coded first followed by a CKD Stagespecific code. For example, an individual with HTN for 20 years, GFR 50 mL/min/1. 73 m2, and microalbuminuria should be assigned codes 403. 10, 585. 3, and 791. 0. If HTN follows the onset of diabetic CKD and is not malignant (asymptomatic, not requiring hospitalization or associated with acute target organ damage), then the code for benign hypertension associated with CKD Stages 15 but not ESRD (403. 10) should follow coding of the primary disorder with a CKD Stage code (eg, 250. 40, 403. 10, and 585. x). In this case, the diabetic nephropathy code (250. 4x) is followed by the benign HTN of CKD code (403. 10), and the CKD stage code (585. x). Hypertensive nephrosclerosis cannot be coded concurrent with primary hypertension (401. 9) or secondary hypertension (405. 0405. 9). Generalized or regional atherosclerosis often accompanies hypertension and these disorders can also be coded when actively managed.

10), and the CKD stage code (585. x). Hypertensive nephrosclerosis cannot be coded concurrent with primary hypertension (401. 9) or secondary hypertension (405. 0405. 9). Generalized or regional atherosclerosis often accompanies hypertension and these disorders can also be coded when actively managed. However, coding here may be more appropriately coded as unspecified hypertension, with CKD (403. 90, 403. 91). CKD Complication Codes This section describes under-coding of CKD-associated complications. Mineral, electrolyte and acid-base disturbances of CKD are often diagnosed and managed, but not coded. Hypotonicity/hyponatremia, hypertonicity/hypernatremia, dyskalemias, dyscalcemias, phosphorus disorders, and acid-base disturbances should be coded when present, appropriately documented and addressed in the treatment plan (see above). Hyperuricemia is coded as abnormal blood chemistry (790. 6) and is frequent in CKD, but it does not define gout (274. 0274. 9) or uric acid stone disease (274. 11). 64 CKD Code Omissions Coding omissions are frequent in CKD. For example, the codes for hypertensive heart and CKD (404. x) are underutilized. In addition, all UTIs (599. 0) should be coded concurrently with organism-specific codes (eg, E. coli 482. 2). Lastly, parenchymal abnormalities such as cysts (acquired 593. 2; congenital 753. 10, 753. 11; ADPKD 753. 13) or agenesis/dysgenesis (753. 0) and dysplasia (753. 15) have specific codes, but are often not coded at all. COMMENTS Evaluation and Management coding of CKD should be internally reviewed at each institution and with respective healthcare payors. ICD-9-CM will eventually be phased out in the United States. ICD-10-CM is a more complicated system that is substantially more robust in its descriptive capabilities. The codes described in this section will no longer be applicable at the time of ICD-10-CM implementation. REFERENCES H Quan, et al.

You may have many concerns. These concerns can be physical, emotional, and financial. If your kidney disease diagnosis is recent, you may feel overwhelmed, confused, and angry. You may worry about how kidney failure and dialysis will change your future and your quality of life. But there are some important things you can do to help yourself. Learn all you can about your treatment options. Take an active role in decisions about your care. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Kidney failure can be treated with hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or kidney transplantation. Reviewing the pros and cons of each of these options can help you and your healthcare professional decide what is best for you. This booklet is about a special type of hemodialysis hemodialysis done at home, or home hemodialysis. See for a list of resources on the other treatment options. How hemodialysis works Hemodialysis is a treatment that replaces some of the work of your own kidneys. Hemodialysis clears wastes and extra fluid from your blood. Your blood is cleaned by a part of the dialysis machine called the artificial kidney or dialyzer. For blood to flow through the dialysis machine, you need to have an access, or entrance, to your bloodstream. This is created by minor surgery, usually to an arm. (See Getting an access on. ) At each dialysis treatment, two needles are placed into the dialysis access site in your arm; one needle carries your blood through sterile tubing to the artificial kidney (dialyzer), and your cleaned blood is returned to your body through the second needle. Home hemodialysis Hemodialysis can be done at home. When you do home hemodialysis, you may be better able to fit your treatments into your daily schedule. If you work, home hemodialysis may make your treatments easier to plan. KIDNEY. ORG 5 Studies show that the more you know about your treatment and the more you do on your own, the better you are likely to feel on dialysis. If your doctor recommended hemodialysis as the best treatment option for you, hemodialysis at home may be a good choice. A brief history of home hemodialysis Home hemodialysis began in the United States in 1964. By 1973, when Medicare first covered dialysis costs, 40 percent of patients received their hemodialysis at home. With the start of Medicare payments for dialysis, more centers began to open. In 2008, new regulations were established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the government agency responsible for Medicare. Now, dialysis centers are required to inform patients about the option of home dialysis. Your dialysis team members must provide you with a list of places that will train you how to do home hemodialysis. The regulations require that people with severe kidney disease and kidney failure receive information about all possible treatment options. Medicare covers up to 80% of the cost of home hemodialysis, just as they do for dialysis in a hospital or other treatment center.

(See Getting an access on. ) KIDNEY. ORG 9 Different schedules of home hemodialysis You can do hemodialysis at home using one of three types of schedules. Whichever schedule you choose, you will be trained to perform dialysis safely and to handle any problems that may arise. Everyone is different and training time differs between people, but usually takes three to eight weeks. 1. Conventional home hemodialysis: You perform hemodialysis three times a week for three to four hours or longer each time. 2. Short daily home hemodialysis: This schedule calls for hemodialysis five to seven times a week, using machines designed for short, daily home treatment. Treatments usually last about two hours each. Because you are receiving dialysis more often, less fluid needs to be removed from 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION your blood each time. This reduces recovery symptoms like headaches, nausea, cramping, and feeling washed out after your treatment. 3. Nocturnal (nighttime) home hemodialysis: These are longer, slower treatments done at night while you sleep. You may receive this kind of dialysis six nights a week or every other night. It depends on what your doctor recommends for you. Treatments usually last about six to eight hours. Some centers monitor your treatments by having information from your dialysis machine sent to a staffed location via telephone modem or the Internet. More hours of dialysis each week can increase waste removal from your blood. Its also possible to combine daily and nocturnal home hemodialysis. Whether you can combine treatments depends on your needs, your health, and your dialysis machine.

More hours of dialysis each week can increase waste removal from your blood. Its also possible to combine daily and nocturnal home hemodialysis. Whether you can combine treatments depends on your needs, your health, and your dialysis machine. Whatever treatment schedule you choose, its important to know if you are receiving the right amount of dialysis. Blood tests are done regularly during the year to check on the amount of dialysis you receive and to help decide if any adjustments to your treatment plan are needed. For more information on how the amount of dialysis is measured, speak with your doctor and your dialysis care team. KIDNEY. ORG 11 Added benefits of short daily and nocturnal home hemodialysis Having frequent dialysis is closer to how your kidneys functioned when they were healthy. Many reports indicate that people who use short daily and nocturnal home hemodialysis: Take less medication to control high blood pressure and anemia (low red blood cell count) Take less medication to keep high blood phosphorus under control Have improved blood pressure, nerve damage, and symptoms of restless leg syndrome Feel better during dialysis and less washed out after dialysis Have fewer limits on what they can eat and drink Have more energy Sleep better Have fewer and shorter hospital stays Have a better quality of life Live longer With daily home hemodialysis, you dont have the swings in your blood chemistries and fluids like you do when you dont dialyze every day, so you feel a lot better. Home dialysis is for people who want to be in control of the process and be at home. David J. , patient on daily home hemodialysis 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Deciding if home hemodialysis is right for you Home hemodialysis is not a good fit for everyone. You will need to find a dialysis center that offers training and support in home hemodialysis. You must also be willing to be responsible for your own treatment. The following are questions you may want to discuss with your doctor, your employer, and healthcare team. Questions to consider YOUR JOB: Can I keep my job and do home hemodialysis? Can I get paid time off to train for home hemodialysis? If I quit working, how long can I keep my health insurance? Can I get other health insurance? How will this change affect my family and me? KIDNEY. ORG 13 FINDING A HOME HEMODIALYSIS PROGRAM Does my local dialysis center offer home hemodialysis training? If not, where is the closest center with training? Am I willing to change centers, or even doctors, to get home hemodialysis? How far would I be willing to go for training that takes several weeks and for clinic visits every four to six weeks? How long does training take? What is the training schedule? How will I learn to put the needles in my arm for hemodialysis? Who will be my trainer? Can I make an appointment to talk with them?

Can I make an appointment to talk with them? 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION CHANGES AT HOME What will it take to install a dialysis machine in my house? Will my landlord allow me to put a dialysis machine in my apartment? Where can I put the equipment and supplies? What are the rules about the disposal of medical waste in my area? How much will my insurance pay for training and home hemodialysis supplies? COSTS What out-of-pocket costs will I need to pay? Will insurance pay for any necessary changes in my home? How much will my electric, gas, and water bills increase? WORKING WITH THE DIALYSIS CENTER How will the dialysis center staff support me once Im doing treatment at home? Who repairs my machine when it breaks? How long do repairs usually take? Where can I get dialysis if my machine is broken? How often do I need to come back to the center for clinic visits? Is transportation assistance available if I need a ride to the clinic? Can I see my local doctor monthly, so I wont have to come to the clinic as often? KIDNEY. ORG 15 LONG-TERM CONCERNS: What treatment does my kidney doctor believe is best? Why? Will I do better long-term with home hemodialysis? New technology More user-friendly dialysis machines are being developed for home use. These machines are easier to set up, clean, and disinfect and have easy-to-use alarms to alert you to a problem. With some newer machines, there are fewer supplies to store. If you and your doctor think home hemodialysis is a good choice for you, ask your dialysis training staff about the best equipment for you. With daily dialysis, Ive noticed that I have increased energy, better sleep, and improved concentration at work. People shouldnt have to live to dialyze. Daily home hemodialysis on your own schedule makes it possible to live life as best you can. Bill P. , a patient on daily home hemodialysis 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Finding a center that offers home hemodialysis Your healthcare professional will help you find a dialysis center that has a home hemodialysis program certified by CMS. If your center does not offer home hemodialysis, see for websites that can help you find centers that offer home hemodialysis. Visit the center. Talk with the home training nurse and other staff. Ask to speak to patients who do home dialysis. Two things will ensure your success: 1. a dialysis center and nurse willing to train you and follow your care; and 2. your commitment to learn and do hemodialysis at home. KIDNEY. ORG 17 Staying in touch with your dialysis center You will need to visit your dialysis center about once a month for a check-up, lab tests, and to see your kidney doctor, nurse, dietitian, and social worker.

KIDNEY. ORG 17 Staying in touch with your dialysis center You will need to visit your dialysis center about once a month for a check-up, lab tests, and to see your kidney doctor, nurse, dietitian, and social worker. You may also need to receive some of your medicines, such as intravenous iron, at your center. Between visits to the center, your healthcare team is there to help. If you have a question about your diet or treatment, call your center. When you go home after your training, your center will give you phone numbers that you can call if you have questions. Some centers monitor care over the Internet. Keep a list of important phone numbers in a handy place (see ). You can use the chart at the end of this booklet to get started. 18 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Preparing for home hemodialysis Getting an access To do any type of hemodialysis, you need to have a way to gain access to your bloodstream. Your access is created by a doctor called a vascular surgeon. There are three types of access: Fistula: This is the first choice for an access for most people. It has fewer problems and lasts the longest, especially if you are the only person inserting the needles. A fistula involves surgery to connect an artery and a nearby vein, usually in your arm. Have your fistula created early, so it has time to heal and is ready to use when you need to start treatment. KIDNEY. ORG 19 Graft: If the surgeon evaluates your blood vessels and a fistula is not possible, a graft is the second best access choice for hemodialysis. A graft also requires surgery. It is made by connecting an artery and nearby vein with a small, soft tube made of synthetic material. However, a graft is more prone to infection and clotting than a fistula. If that happens, you may need treatment or more surgery to fix or replace the graft. Catheter: Another way to access your bloodstream is to have a plastic tube called a catheter put into a large vein in your neck or chest. Catheters are only used long-term if no other access can be made. Catheters are more prone to infections and clots. If you have a catheter, you must follow strict catheter care instructions to stay healthy. You will learn how to: Set up your equipment in your home Insert and remove your needles Figure out how much fluid to remove from your blood during dialysis Use and care for your dialysis machine and water system (if needed) Notice and handle medical and equipment problems that may occur Store and order your supplies Check your blood pressure 20 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Paying for home hemodialysis Insurance coverage The social worker at your dialysis center should give you information about coverage for home hemodialysis and other costs that may be related to receiving your treatment at home.

Medicare pays for part of the cost of home hemodialysis and training. Medicare is not just for people who are 65 and older. The program also helps Americans and legal residents of all ages who need dialysis or a kidney transplant and qualify for coverage. Other sources that help pay for dialysis include: Private insurance Some managed care organizations Medicaid Veterans Administration Indian Health Service (IHS) KIDNEY. ORG 21 If you have an employer group health plan, it will be the primary coverage for the first 30 months of your treatment, with Medicare as your secondary insurer. After those first 30 months, Medicare will become your primary insurance. Your home training nurse will tell you if your home will need plumbing or wiring changes for home hemodialysis. Some of these costs may be covered by private insurance or your center. You may be given the option of receiving your dialysis supplies from your dialysis center or dealing directly with a supply company. You can expect your monthly water and electric bills to increase a little. Speak to your social worker if you have additional questions or concerns about coverage for home hemodialysis. 22 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION I started feeling stronger and more energetic. I had less bone pain, so I was able to walk more and started exercising regularly. I stopped taking some medications and I generally feel good. With home dialysis, you do everything from setting up the machine, connecting and disconnecting yourself to the machine, and disinfecting the machine afterwards. But taken as a whole, the positives far outweigh the negatives. Henry E. , a patient on nocturnal home hemodialysis KIDNEY. ORG 23 Summary Key points to remember Pros of home hemodialysis Its easier to fit into your daily or weekly schedule. There are fewer restrictions on what you can eat and drink, especially for those doing daily or nocturnal treatment. You are in control of your own treatment and have more independence. Your health over time is likely to be better. Many patients say they feel better and have more energy. Three basic types of hemodialysis can be performed at home: Conventionalthree times a week for three to four hours or longer each time Short dailyfive to seven times a week for about two hours each time Nocturnalthree to six nights a week for six to eight hours each time. Talk to your healthcare practitioner about whether home hemodialysis would be a good treatment choice for you. They can also help you choose the best type of home hemodialysis for your needs. To perform hemodialysis, you will need to have a permanent access to your blood created. Doctors recommend a fistula for most patients. 24 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Both you and a care partner (in most cases) will need to be trained to do home hemodialysis. Your care partner may be a family member, friend, or a healthcare worker whom you hire to assist you. Medicare, private insurance, and several other sources pay for home hemodialysis.

But too much potassium in your blood can be dangerous. It can cause serious heart problems. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION What causes hyperkalemia? The most common causes include: Kidney disease. Hyperkalemia can happen if your kidneys do not work well. It is the job of the kidneys to balance the amount of potassium taken in with the amount lost in urine. Potassium is taken in through the foods you eat and liquids you drink. It is filtered by the kidneys, and lost through urine. Healthy kidneys can make up for high potassium by removing more. In the early stages of kidney disease, the kidneys can often make up for high potassium. But as kidney function gets worse, they may not be able to remove enough potassium from your body. Advanced kidney disease is a common cause of hyperkalemia. Common causes of kidney disease include diabetes and high blood pressure. A diet high in potassium. Eating too much food that is high in potassium can also cause hyperkalemia, especially in people with advanced kidney disease. Foods such as melons, orange juice, and bananas are high in potassium. (See ) Drugs that prevent the kidneys from losing enough potassium. Some drugs can keep your kidneys from removing enough potassium. This can cause your potassium levels to rise. (See ) Other (less common) causes include: Taking extra potassium, such as a salt substitute or certain supplements. A disorder called Addisons disease, which can occur if your body does not make enough of certain hormones. Hormones are chemicals produced by different glands WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 5 and organs, including the kidneys, to trigger certain responses in your body. Burns or other severe injuries. Poorly controlled diabetes. What are the symptoms of hyperkalemia? Many people have few, if any, symptoms. If symptoms do appear, they are usually mild and non-specific. You may feel some muscle weakness, numbness, tingling, nausea, or other unusual feelings. Hyperkalemia is common in people with kidney disease. It usually develops slowly over many weeks or months, and is most often mild. It can recur. If hyperkalemia comes on suddenly and you have very high levels of potassium, you may feel heart palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, or vomiting. Sudden or severe hyperkalemia is a life-threatening condition. It requires immediate medical care. Call 911 or go to the emergency room. How do I know if I have hyperkalemia? A blood test can find the level of potassium in your blood. High potassium is usually found by chance during a routine blood test. Your healthcare provider will also give you a complete physical checkup. You will be asked about your medical history, your diet, and the medicines you take. This will help find out what caused your hyperkalemia and plan your treatment. It is important that you tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, even over-thecounter products such as herbals and other supplements.

This will help find out what caused your hyperkalemia and plan your treatment. It is important that you tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, even over-thecounter products such as herbals and other supplements. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Many herbal remedies, supplements, salt substitutes, and over-the counter products have high amounts of potassium. Treatment for Hyperkalemia Can hyperkalemia be treated? Yes. You may need to follow a low-potassium diet. Your healthcare provider will tell you if any changes in your medicines are needed. You should not take salt substitutes, which are high in potassium. A dietitian can help you create a meal plan that is low in potassium. Some people may also need special medicine to help remove extra potassium from the body and keep it from coming back. This may include: Water pills (diuretics) help rid your body of extra potassium. They work by making your kidney create more urine. Potassium is normally removed through urine. Potassium binders often come in the form of a powder. They are mixed with a small amount of water and taken with food. When swallowed, they bind to the extra potassium in the bowels and remove it. Some potassium binders can also be taken by the rectum (an enema). You must follow the instructions carefully when taking potassium binders. For example, potassium binders may interfere with how other drugs work if you take them at the same time. Potassium binders are not for use in children. For sudden or severe hyperkalemia, you will need immediate medical care. If you have heart palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or muscle paralysis, call 911 or go to the emergency room. These could be signs of a serious heart problem. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 7 What is a normal level of potassium in blood? For most people, the level of potassium in your blood should be between 3. 5 and 5. 0, depending on the laboratory that is used. Ask your healthcare provider what your potassium level is. If I have hyperkalemia, should I stop taking my medicines? Do not stop taking your prescribed medicines unless your healthcare provider tells you to, especially if you have a medical condition such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or kidney disease. Call your healthcare provider if you have any questions about the medicines you take. 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION What kinds of medicines can cause hyperkalemia? Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, even herbal supplements or over-the-counter drugs. This is very important. Some examples of medicines that can raise your potassium levels are described here. This list does not contain all medicines that can raise your potassium levels. Keep an updated list of all the medicines you take. Have it with you during your healthcare visits. ACE inhibitors, ARBS, and beta-blockers (blood pressure medicines). Blood pressure medicines are used to help lower blood pressure.

KIDNEY. ORG 13 What else can I do to keep potassium levels from getting too high? Eat a variety of foods, but in moderation. Remember, almost all foods have some potassium. The size of the serving and how the food is prepared is very important. Drain canned fruits, vegetables, and meats carefully before serving. Do not drink or use the liquid. If you want to include some high-potassium vegetables in your diet, eat smaller portions or leach them before using. If you are on dialysis, do not skip or shorten your dialysis treatments. How do I leach vegetables? Peel and place vegetables such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, beets, winter squash and rutabagas in cold water so they wont darken. Slice the vegetable 1/8th inch thick. Rinse in warm water for a few seconds. Soak for a minimum of two hours in warm water. Use ten times the amount of water to the amount of vegetables. If soaking longer, change the water every four hours. Rinse under warm water again for a few seconds. Cook vegetables with five times the amount of water to the amount of vegetable. 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Points to remember: Hyperkalemia can happen if your kidneys do not work well. A simple blood test can determine the level of potassium in your blood. In most people, hyperkalemia develops slowly over weeks or months and is usually mild. Many people can control high potassium by following a low-potassium diet, and reducing or avoiding certain medicines, at the direction of their healthcare provider. Others may need to take water pills or potassium binders to help control high potassium. Sudden or severe hyperkalemia can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical care. Call 911 or go to the emergency room if you experience heart palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, or vomiting. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 15 Where can I get more information?

IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO START DIALYSIS TREATMENT www. kidney. org For many people with kidney failure, dialysis helps them live longer and improves their quality of life. But for some people, the improvement they feel may be a lot more limited often because of their serious health problems. It is important to know that in such a situation, you have the right to decide not to start dialysis. Before making a decision, however, you should discuss your thoughts carefully with people you trust and seek advice from your doctor or other healthcare provider, family member(s), your lawyer or others who have your best interests at heart. This booklet has been written to answer some general questions you may have about the choice not to start dialysis. Can I really decide not to start dialysis treatment? Yes. You have the right to decide not to start dialysis if you feel that the burdens outweigh the benefits to you. If you are not able to make this kind of decision, someone (such as a family member, lawyer, etc. ) can make this decision on your behalf. The person you name to make such decisions is called your surrogate. (See next question. ) 2 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How do I go about naming someone to be my surrogate? A surrogate is someone you choose to make decisions for you if you are not able to make them yourself. Naming a surrogate is done by filling out a form known as an advance directive, a healthcare proxy, or a durable healthcare power of attorney. It is important to make sure the person you name is willing to act on your behalf. It is also very important that you tell the person about your wishes and values so that he or she can make the decisions you would make if you were not able to speak for yourself. It will be helpful to your surrogate if you give clear directions on your advance directive form about dialysis and/or other medical treatments you would want or not want. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 3 The role and responsibilities of the surrogate, as well as the types of decisions the surrogate may make, vary from state to state, depending on the laws of each state. Generally, the surrogate must follow your wishes. For more information about naming a surrogate and about the laws in your state, you may want to speak with an attorney or your local or state bar association. You may also obtain copies of the forms used in your state by calling or writing to the: National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, 1731 King Street, Suite 100, Alexandria, VA, 22314; phone: 800. 646. 6460 or 703. 837. 1500; www. nhpco. org. (Also see the National Kidney Foundation booklet Advance Directives: A Guide for Patients and Their Families. ) Will my doctor help me decide whether to start treatment? Yes.

646. 6460 or 703. 837. 1500; www. nhpco. org. (Also see the National Kidney Foundation booklet Advance Directives: A Guide for Patients and Their Families. ) Will my doctor help me decide whether to start treatment? Yes. Your doctor will speak with you about what dialysis treatment involves and what deciding not to start dialysis would mean for you. While you try to make this decision, you may also want to get advice from people who provide emotional support to you and your loved ones and other trained professionals, such as your social 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION worker. However, the final decision about starting or not starting treatment remains with you or your surrogate. Suppose I am not sure whether dialysis could help me? Sometimes it may not be clear whether the benefits of dialysis outweigh the burdens. Each persons situation is different. If you are uncertain, you may be able to start treatment for a trial periodfor example, one to three months. During and after the trial period, your doctor and the other members of your dialysis team will talk with you about how you are feeling and coping with the treatment routine. Ask as many questions as you need to help with your decision to continue or to stop treatment. How do I discuss this decision with my family and friends? Many people find it difficult to talk about whether or not to start treatment, and they worry about how others will feel and react. Although you may find it hard at first, the best approach is to discuss your feelings openly with your loved ones. Your family will most likely feel very emotional too, and may have questions. You may wish to include, other people WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 5 in this discussion whose advice you value, such as your religious or spiritual advisor, social worker, doctor or other healthcare worker. Will I be asked to speak to a mental health professional? If your doctor is concerned that you may not want to start dialysis for an emotional reason, such as depression, he or she may ask you to speak with a psychiatrist, social worker or other counseling professional. Depression may be treated successfully with counseling, medicine or a combination of both. Your doctor may also want you to speak with a mental health professional to make sure you understand the full impact of choosing not to start dialysis. How long will I live if I choose not to start dialysis? There is no certain answer to this question. It varies, because everybody is different. Each persons medical status is unique. People with kidney failure may survive days to weeks without dialysis, depending on the amount of kidney function they have, how severe their symptoms are, and their overall medical condition. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Is death from kidney failure painful? Not usually. If you do feel any discomfort, pain medication may be prescribed for you.

6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Is death from kidney failure painful? Not usually. If you do feel any discomfort, pain medication may be prescribed for you. Without treatment for kidney failure, toxins, and fluid will build up in your body, making you feel increasingly tired, nauseous and itchy. These symptoms can be controlled with medication and other supportive measures to make you more comfortable and lessen your anxiety. The fluid build-up can make it more difficult for you to breathe. Your doctor can prescribe medication or a treatment called ultrafiltration to remove fluid and make breathing easier for you. Your doctor may also recommend that you limit your intake of salt and fluids to reduce fluid weight gain. Is deciding not to start dialysis considered suicide? Many religions believe people have the right to refuse medical treatment, including dialysis, if they feel it will not help them and will be burdensome. You may wish to speak with your religious or spiritual advisor if you have concerns about this. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 7 What type of food and drink could I have? Typically, there is no reason for you to continue to follow your kidney diet once you choose end-of-life care. In fact, favorite foods and beverages are usually encouraged. Your doctor, nurse, and dietitian can answer other specific questions you may have about food and fluid intake. If I make this decision, will my doctor continue to help me? Yes. Your doctor should be available to you and your family to discuss your concerns and advise you about the type of care you might need. Your doctor should work with members of your healthcare team to arrange the necessary referrals or consultations for your circumstances. Other professionals, such as the social worker or nurse who has been part of your healthcare team should also remain available to you. Do I have a choice of where I die? Your wishes about where you want to die will be honored as much as possible. Many people choose to die at home, where they feel more comfortable in familiar surroundings. If you choose this option, a hospice 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION or home health agency may assist you and your loved ones in making any special arrangements for your care at home. A nursing home may be an option for some people. Admission to the hospital may not be a consideration, depending on your insurance coverage and overall medical condition. Could I get hospice care? If you choose not to start dialysis, you require end-of-life care and you are eligible for hospice services. The type of hospice care available may be either a home hospice program or a hospice facility. A social worker, a visiting nurse service or home care agency may be able to help you and your loved ones make arrangements for hospice care. Hospice services usually include some visits from a nurse, a home health aid, and a social worker.

A social worker, a visiting nurse service or home care agency may be able to help you and your loved ones make arrangements for hospice care. Hospice services usually include some visits from a nurse, a home health aid, and a social worker. For more information about hospice programs in your community, speak with your doctor, nurse or social worker. You may also be able to get information from your religious community, or from friends and neighbors who have had experience with hospice care. If you are a senior citizen, you can contact a local senior WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 9 center or the local or state Office on Aging. Also check your local yellow pages and Internet resources such as www. hospicedirectory. org If I choose to die at home, can I get a home healthcare worker to help my family care for me? The types of services covered at home will depend on your insurance. If you are in a home hospice program, a home health aide may be available to assist. If your insurance does not cover a home health aide, and you and your loved ones wish to pay privately for these services, you can do so. There may also be government programs to help with costs. Ask your doctor, social worker, and community or government agencies about available and affordable home services. Will I still be covered by Medicare and/or my private medical insurance if I stop treatment? Your Medicare coverage will not end, even if you decide to stop dialysis. It is important that you and your family speak with your doctor about the type of care you will need. Once this is decided, you can check on whether or not Medicare and/or private insurance will cover this care. 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION If I change my mind, can I go back on dialysis? You may start or return to dialysis if you change your mind. If you have missed several treatments, you may have some discomfort when you first start dialysis again. You will require vascular access if you do not already have a working dialysis fistula. You should discuss the possibility of returning to dialysis with your doctor. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 11 Is there anything else I should know about not starting dialysis? If you decide not to start treatment, you or your surrogate may want to make sure the following items are in order: Signed Advance Directives documents that comply with your state law. Advance Directives refer to documenting your health and medical treatment wishes and designating a surrogate. You do not need a lawyer to complete advance directives. There are usually three types of advance directives: Living Will: This specifies what kind of medical treatment you want if you become unable to make decisions yourselffor example, the use of life-sustaining therapies or equipment like CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) and ventilators, feeding and other treatments like pain medication.

The high CKD burden in this region is predominantly driven by an increased prevalence of risk factors including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and use of traditional medicines and is further aggravated by challenges associated with effective implementation of population-based screening and surveillance systems in early detection and intervention of CKD. The Asian continent mostly comprised of lowand middle-income countries with resource restraints lacks robust population-based CKD registries resulting in a paucity of data on CKD incidence and prevalence, various treatment modalities, uptake of current guidelines, and the overall impact of implementation of developmental programs. There is an urgent need for a collaborative action plan between the healthcare community and governments in this region to detect CKD in its early stages and prevent its complications including kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and death. Research-based evidence on the impact of early detection, sustainable treatment options, quality of life, delay or avoidance of dialysis, and related cost analysis is the need of the hour. We highlight successful implementation of strategic and policy-sharing programs adopted in a few countries; also, consolidate available region-specific data, quantify estimates of CKD burden and propose strategies with a multidisciplinary approach involving patients, the healthcare community and governmental bodies to combat CKD and its complications.

krcp-ksn. org Makmun, et al. Burden of chronic kidney disease in Asia Table 3. Developmental programs and initiatives for CKD screening Country Developmental programs Taiwan The national kidney care program has resulted in improved clinical outcomes along with a reduction in health care system costs. The Department of Health made CKD prevention and care a major public health priority and an integrated CKD care program was initiated to promote the screening of high-risk populations, patient education, and multidisciplinary team care. Nephrotoxic Chinese herbs containing aristolochic acid were prohibited through public health legislation in 2003. National pay-for-performance programs for CKD were implemented as part of health care improvement projects, along with diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease care in 2006 (pre-ESKD program) and 2011 (early CKD program) 119. The Taiwan model has been proposed for adoption by the Indonesian Ministry of Health as well. Republic of Korea The Korean National Health Screening Program for CKD was implemented in 2002 with biannual screening starting at the age of 40 years for CKD by proteinuria (dipstick) and eGFR testing. Korean organ transplantation policies have ensured an increase in the availability of donor transplants, the Korean Society for Transplantation established a webbased registry, the Korean Organ Transplantation Registry to educate patients, donor families, and healthcare professionals. Philippines The Philippines national insurance covers kidney transplantation as a single largest payment for any surgical procedure. Thailand The Chronic Kidney Disease Prevention in the Northeast Thailand (CKDNET) is an initiative to reduce the CKD burden in the region. Pamphlets, posters, brochures, and other media are distributed for CKD education and awareness at the community level. Locally suitable practice guidelines have been formulated 120. Hong Kong The Screening for Hong Kong Asymptomatic Renal Population and Evaluation (SHARE) program is an effective screening program at the primary care level that identified potential subjects for further evaluation and aided in educating the public about the significance of following up even asymptomatic renal diseases 121. Singapore The HALT-CKD program was started in 2017, the Holistic Approach in Lowering and Tracking Chronic Kidney Disease (HALT-CKD) program concentrates on a concerted effort for timely detection and delaying the progression of CKD in primary care settings through an integrated and multi-faceted approach. The program focuses on a series of lifestyle modifications (low-salt diet, physical activity, smoking cessation) and medical interventions such as optimization of RAASi, MRA, and SGLT2i government has also authorized subsidies and reimbursements to reduce the financial burden in CKD patients 122. Malaysia Under the Strategic Action Plan for Healthy Kidneys (ACT-KID) 2018-2025 there are various initiatives utilizing multisectoral collaborations to promote public and healthcare practitioner awareness of CKD which emphasize the need for screening and early detection, as well as guideline-directed CKD management 123. Indonesia The government NHIS launched a noncommunicable and chronic disease management program named Indonesian Chronic Disease Management Program (PROLANIS) in 2014 with T2DM and hypertension as the main focus.

Indonesia The government NHIS launched a noncommunicable and chronic disease management program named Indonesian Chronic Disease Management Program (PROLANIS) in 2014 with T2DM and hypertension as the main focus. It is specifically designed to be implemented at the primary care level (government-owned community healthcare centers, primary care clinics, or private doctors). As an integrated health service program, it controls the clinical and laboratory outcomes, prevents disease complications and improves patients quality of life 124. This program gives additional benefits to its participants through monthly regular meetings for medical consultation, peer group education by healthcare professionals, healthcare visit reminders, peer club activities, and home visits.

Indications requiring referral to kidney specialists. Referral indications based on CKD staging and specific conditions warranting comprehensive evaluation and management are elaborated. These indications emphasize the importance of specialized assessment and intervention by kidney specialists to optimize patient care and outcomes in CKD management. Albuminuria and proteinuria can be measured using excretion rates in timed urine collections, the ratio of concentrations to creatinine concentration in spot urine samples, and using reagent strips in spot urine samples. Relationships among measurement methods within a category are not exact. For example, the relationships between AER and ACR and between PER and PCR are based on the assumption that average creatinine excretion rate is approximately 1. 0 g/day or 10 mmol/day. The conversions are rounded for pragmatic reasons (for an exact conversion from mg/g of creatinine to mg/mmol of creatinine, multiply by 0. 113). Creatinine excretion varies with age, sex, race, and diet; therefore, the relationship among these categories is approximate only. ACR 10 mg/g (1 mg/mmol) is considered normal; ACR 1030 mg/g (13 mg/mmol) is considered high normal. ACR 2, 200 mg/g (220 mg/mmol) is considered nephrotic range.

Initiatives directed at effective deKRT facilities are limited with inadequate or nonexistent tection and management of CKD can be categorized into reimbursement policies such as India where patients bear three levels: patient, physician and medical societies, and the expenses of KRT. KRT reimbursement policies of counpolicy makers and government. tries in Asia are listed below (Table 5). Patient advocacy groups for increasing CKD awareness and eliminating negative perceptions about the disease Lack of adequate data, policies, and programs among CKD patients have been particularly beneficial in India as primary care physicians are often busy in hospiThere is a lack of exact estimates of CKD burden in Asia tals and have limited time for such activities. In Republic with limited screening and surveillance systems. Current of Korea, short educational videos engage the younger data collection efforts are focused on KRT through dialysis population with access to the internet and smartphones and transplantation registries; however, systematic assessand create CKD awareness. This is similar to the situation ment of CKD in its early stages is critical as well 128.

kidney-international. org abstract Abstract The KidneyDisease: ImprovingGlobalOutcomes(KDIGO) 2024ClinicalPracticeGuideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an update to the KDIGO 2012 guideline on the topic. The aim is to assist clinicians caring for people with CKD, both adultsandchildren. Peoplereceivingdialysisandkidneytransplantrecipientsarenotthefocusof thisguideline. ThescopeincludeschaptersdedicatedtotheevaluationofCKD, riskassessmentin peoplewithCKD, managementtodelayCKDprogressionandmanageitscomplications, medical management and drug stewardship in CKD, and optimal models of CKD care. In addition, this guideline includes a comprehensive introduction from the guideline Co-Chairs, a patient foreword, a discussion of special population considerations, a presentation of the relative and absolute risks associated with specific outcomes from the CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKDPC), andanextensivesectiondedicatedtoresearchrecommendationsbasedonthecurrentgaps inevidence. Thegoaloftheguidelineistogenerateausefulresourceforcliniciansandpatientsby providing actionable recommendations based on a rigorous formal evidence review, practice points that serve to direct clinical care or activities for which a systematic review was not conducted, and useful infographics. The guideline targets a broad audience of healthcare providers involved in the care of people with CKD as well as people with CKD themselves while being mindfulofimplicationsfor policyandpayment. Developmentofthisguideline updatefollowed an explicit process of evidence review and appraisal. Treatment approaches and guideline recommendationsarebasedonsystematicreviewsofrelevantstudies, andappraisalofthecertainty of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed, with areas of future research also presented.

Key recommendations and practice points are highlighted: Recommendation 3. 6. 1: We recommend starting renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (RASi) (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ACEi or angiotensin II receptor blocker ARB) for people with CKD and severely increased albuminuria (G1G4, A3) without diabetes (1B). Recommendation3. 6. 2: WesuggeststartingRASi(ACEiorARB)forpeoplewithCKDandmoderatelyincreased albuminuria (G1G4, A2) without diabetes (2C). Recommendation 3. 6. 3: We recommend starting RASi (ACEi or ARB) for people with CKD and moderately-toseverely increased albuminuria (G1G4, A2 and A3) with diabetes (1B). Recommendation 3. 6. 4: We recommend avoiding any combination of ACEi, ARB, and direct renin inhibitor (DRI) therapy in people with CKD, with or without diabetes (1B). S158 KidneyInternational(2024)105(Suppl4S), S117S314 www. kidney-international. org summary of recommendation statements and practice points Practice Point 3. 6. 1: RASi (ACEi or ARB) should be administered using the highest approved dose that is tolerated to achieve thebenefitsdescribedbecausetheproven benefitswere achievedintrials using thesedoses. Practice Point 3. 6. 2: Changes in BP, serum creatinine, and serum potassium should be checked within 24 weeks of initiation or increase in the dose of a RASi, depending on the current GFR and serum potassium. Practice Point 3. 6. 3: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi.

Practice Point 3. 6. 3: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi. Practice Point 3. 6. 4: Continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose. Practice Point 3. 6. 5: Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR 15 ml/min per 1. 73 m2). PracticePoint3. 6. 6: ConsiderstartingpeoplewithCKDwithnormaltomildlyincreasedalbuminuria(A1)onRASi(ACEior ARB) for specific indications (e. g. , to treat hypertension or heart failure with low ejection fraction). Practice Point 3. 6. 7: ContinueACEiorARB in peoplewithCKD even when the eGFR falls below 30 ml/min per 1. 73 m2. 3. 7 Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease, which stated: We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR 20 ml/min per 1. 73m2withanSGLT2i(1A). 23However, inthepresentguideline, weofferamoregeneral1Arecommendationforadultswith CKD.

Practice Point 3. 7. 1: Once an SGLT2i is initiated, it is reasonable to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR falls below 20 ml/min per 1. 73 m2, unless it is not tolerated or KRT is initiated. Practice Point 3. 7. 2: It is reasonable to withhold SGLT2i during times of prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical medical illness (when people may be at greater risk for ketosis). Recommendation 3. 7. 2: We recommend treating adults with CKD with an SGLT2i for the following (1A): (cid: 3) eGFR 20 ml/min per 1. 73 m2 with urine ACR 200 mg/g (20 mg/mmol), or (cid: 3) heart failure, irrespective of level of albuminuria. Practice Point 3. 7. 3: SGLT2i initiation or use does not necessitate alteration of frequency of CKD monitoring and the reversible decrease in eGFR on initiation is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy. Recommendation 3. 7. 3: We suggest treating adults with eGFR 20 to 45 ml/min per 1. 73 m2 with urine ACR 200 mg/g (20 mg/mmol) with an SGLT2i (2B). 3. 8 Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) TheWorkGrouphighlightsakey recommendation andpracticepointsfromtheKDIGO2022ClinicalPracticeGuidelinefor Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease. 23 Recommendation 3. 8. 1: We suggest a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with proven kidney orcardiovascularbenefitforadultswithT2D, aneGFR25ml/minper1. 73m2, normal serum potassium concentration, and albuminuria (30 mg/g 3 mg/mmol) despite maximum tolerated dose of RAS inhibitor (RASi) (2A).

We recommend checking the PBS and NIP listings for specifics, before prescribing. 9 1 Detecting and diagnosing CKD 10 Kidney Health Australia Clinical presentation of CKD CKD is defined as: An estimated or measured GFR 60 mL/min/1. 73m2 that is present for ≥3 months with or without evidence of kidney damage. Or Evidence of kidney damage, with or without decreased GFR that is present for ≥3 months, as evidenced by the following: Albuminuria Structural abnormalities Haematuria after exclusion (e. g. , on kidney imaging tests) of urological causes Pathological abnormalities (e. g. , kidney biopsy) CKD is generally asymptomatic Up to 90% of kidney function may be lost before symptoms are present, so 1-2 yearly checks for individuals at increased risk are essential. Signs and symptoms of advancing CKD may be general in nature and include: Hypertension Malaise Pruritis Anorexia Nocturia Restless legs Lethargy Haematuria Nausea/vomiting Dyspnoea 11 Targeted detection of CKD Three out of four Australians aged 18 years and over are at increased risk of developing CKD. Detection of CKD should be targeted and focus on people who are known to be at increased risk of developing the condition. The following people are at increased risk of CKD: Diabetes Hypertension Established Family histo ry cardiovascular of kidney failure disease Obesity (body mass Current or past History of acute index ≥30kg/m2 smoker/vaper kidney injury 18 All people aged First Nations Australians 60 years or older aged 18 years or older First Nations Australians experience a higher burden, earlier onset, and faster progression of kidney disease, due to ongoing impacts of colonisation. Clinical tip Individuals at increased risk of developing CKD should be offered a Kidney Health Check (BP, uACR, eGFR) every 1-2 years (annually for First Nations Australians aged ≥18 years, and anyone with diabetes or hypertension). See for information on testing people at risk of CKD. 12 Kidney Health Australia Detecting and diagnosing CKD Early detection of CKD Benefits of early detection Allows for early intervention with treatment approaches and medications that can slow the progression of kidney disease and reduce cardiovascular risk. Facilitates appropriate adjustments to drug dosing, prescribing of medications to slow CKD progression, establishment of a sick day action plan, and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications. Gives patients time to make positive lifestyle changes and appropriately consider treatment options before reaching kidney failure. Has economic benefits for the health system, with every 1 invested leading to 45 of savings in the cost of treating kidney failure and associated CVD. 24 The Kidney Health Check Targeted detection of CKD occurs via Kidney Health Checks for patients at increased risk. The Kidney Health Check involves the following: Blood pressure check Urine test Blood test Consider ambulatory Albumin/creatinine eGFR calculated from blood pressure (ABP) ratio (ACR) to check serum creatinine. monitoring or home BP for albuminuria. monitoring in addition to in-clinic readings.

Established cardiovascular disease is defined as a previous diagnosis of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease. There is emerging evidence that the long-term effects of COVID-19 may also increase the risk of future kidney disease. 25 Therefore, a Kidney Health Check is recommended for individuals who have experienced acute kidney injury (AKI) as a complication of COVID-19 infection and for those with long COVID. A Kidney Health Check is recommended for people who have had hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia and pregnancy-induced hypertension, which are associated with increased future risk of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and CKD. 14 Kidney Health Australia Detecting and diagnosing CKD Early detection of CKD in First Nations Australians26 Indications for Recommended Assessment assessment frequency Aged 18 years As needed Screen for red flags of CKD: Family history of CKD Clinical history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, smoking, established CVD, or acute kidney injury Clinical history of low birth weight Clinical history of recurrent childhood infections Also consider: Socioeconomic status, regional/rural and remote location, housing status, education level Complete a Kidney Health Check (eGFR, uACR and blood pressure check) if concerned.

Attempts should be made to identify the underlying cause of CKD and to fully specify it, e. g. , CKD stage 3b with microalbuminuria (or A2) in the presence of type 2 diabetes. Remember to code all CKD diagnoses in your practice software. Staging of CKD Once an individual is diagnosed with CKD, it is useful to determine their CKD stage and corresponding CKD action plan as this will guide management strategies. To correctly stage CKD, combine the persons kidney function stage (stage 1-5 determined by their eGFR) with their albuminuria stage. This is then plotted on the colour-coded CKD staging table to determine which action plan they should follow. The staging table colours are indicative of increasing risk of kidney failure and CVD, with green indicating minimal risk and red indicating highest risk. 21 Causes of kidney failure The most common causes of kidney failure in Australia are: 15 Other 24% Diabetic kidney disease 40% Familial/ hereditary kidney diseases 7% Glomerular disease 18% Hypertension/ Renal vascular disease 11% Other includes: tubulointerstitial disease (8%), other systemic diseases affecting the kidney (2%), miscellaneous kidney disorders (13%), not reported (1%). 22 Kidney Health Australia Detecting and diagnosing CKD Genetic kidney diseases An important cause of CKD is genetic In addition, there can be a variety of kidney disease.

To aid smoking/vaping cessation, recommend counselling and if required, nicotine replacement therapy or other medication. Compared to people who have never smoked, the risk of developing CKD is increased by 27% for ever smokers, 34% for current smokers and 15% for former smokers. 34 Vaping has been associated with an increased occurrence of albuminuria and raised uACR levels. 35 Use of e-cigarettes has been linked to hyperuricaemia. 36 Further information and resources Quitline - 13 7848.

34 Vaping has been associated with an increased occurrence of albuminuria and raised uACR levels. 35 Use of e-cigarettes has been linked to hyperuricaemia. 36 Further information and resources Quitline - 13 7848. 29 Nutrition and diet Target Dietary Adopt a healthy dietary pattern that includes vegetables, fruit, pattern wholegrains, nuts and legumes, dairy foods, lean meat, poultry, fish, and plant protein. Healthy dietary patterns are associated with reduced risk of mortality and kidney failure, 37 developing CKD, 38 and progression of CKD39. Consuming adequate fruits (2 serves /day) and vegetables (5 serves / day) can reduce the rate of kidney function decline, decrease body weight and blood pressure, and net acid production to manage metabolic acidosis in CKD. 40 Fluid Make water your drink of choice. There is no recommendation for the number of glasses of water that should be consumed daily for kidney health. It is recommended that people should drink water to satisfy thirst. Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) have shown to elevate the risk and progression of CKD and should be avoided. Salt Salt intake should be reduced to 5 g per day. This may be achieved by adopting strategies, such as: not adding salt in cooking or at the table. choosing packaged foods with 120 mg sodium per 100 g. People with a history of hyperkalaemia should not use salt substitutes and use caution with some reduced salt products, due to them containing high amounts of potassium chloride. Ultra- All people with CKD should avoid ultra-processed foods high processed in fat, sugar, and salt, such as biscuits, cakes, packaged snack foods and foods, takeaway foods, soft drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks, sugar fruit juices and cordials. Individualised diets, tailored to cultural differences, food intolerances, cooking skills, food security, comorbidities (such as diabetes), and cost should be considered when recommending dietary options to patients with CKD and their families. For adults with diabetes and CKD, there is no one specific eating pattern that is superior. Individualised advice is recommended to help optimise glycaemic control. 41 Consider referral to an Accredited Practising Dietitian (APD), especially for help with implementing complex dietary changes, such as potassium restrictions, and if other chronic conditions such as diabetes, are present. 30 Kidney Health Australia Managing CKD in Primary Care Further information and resources Kidney Health Australia Diet and Nutrition resources.

Alcohol Target Reduce alcohol consumption the less you drink, the lower your risk of harm from alcohol. 19 Australian guidelines recommend healthy men and women should drink no more than 10 standard drinks a week and no more than 4 standard drinks on any one day to reduce the risk of harm from alcohol-related disease or injury. 19 There are no specific recommendations about safe levels of alcohol consumption in people with CKD.

Include muscle strengthening activities as part of daily activity at least twice per week. 17 31 Higher cardiorespiratory fitness levels, increased participation in physical activity and less time spent in sedentary pursuits are all associated with better outcomes in those living with CKD. 42 A persons overall health, heart health, comorbidities and physical capacity should be considered before increasing physical activity. Light to moderate intensity exercise is a safe starting point for most individuals. Vigorous intensity exercise should only be undertaken by those already doing this level of activity. 43, 44 Further information and resources Physical activity and exercise guidelines for all Australians. Weight management Target Waist circumference 94 cm in men (90 cm in Asian men) or 80 cm in women (including Asian women). BMI 25 kg/m2 (23 kg/m2 Asian population16). Central obesity (measured by waist circumference) is a strong predictor of CKD progression. Obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) doubles the risk of developing CKD. 45 People with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 may be more likely to develop albuminuria. 45 Further information and resources Resources on Obesity and Overweight. 32 Kidney Health Australia Managing CKD in Primary Care Pharmacological management of CKD Clinical tip Remember to code CKD correctly.

In a primary care setting, it is very likely that individuals will have a CKD diagnosis that sits alongside one or more other chronic conditions.

CKD and hypertension Hypertension is both a cause and a complication of CKD and can be difficult to control. The risks of uncontrolled hypertension include, progression of kidney disease and increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Hypertension should be considered as part of cardiovascular risk (see ). Hypertension treatment targets Who? Target All people with CKD Maintain blood pressure consistently below 130/80 mmHg Some evidence and clinical guidelines suggest aiming for a lower blood pressure target (systolic BP 120mmHg) in people with CKD who are at high CVD risk may improve outcomes. 72-75 Aiming for a systolic blood pressure of 120 mmHg may be appropriate in certain individuals who are at very high cardiovascular risk. Lower blood pressure targets need to be balanced with an increased risk of side effects including: increased risk of falls due to hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities and episodes of AKI. 52 Kidney Health Australia Managing CKD alongside other chronic conditions Algorithm for management of hypertension in people with CKD Person has CKD Is blood pressure consistently below target (130/80 mmHg)?

System (RAS) Based on many clinical trials demonstrating their inhibitors - e. g. , effectiveness in decreasing proteinuria and delaying CKD ACE inhibitors or progression, the use of RAS inhibitors is recommended as ARBs the first-line pharmacologic strategy for patients with CKD and proteinuria with and without diabetes. They cause a reduction in glomerular blood flow, and GFR can decline when treatment is initiated. Provided the reduction is less than 25% within two weeks of starting therapy, the ACE inhibitor or ARB should be continued. If the reduction in GFR is greater than 25% below the baseline value, the ACE inhibitor or ARB should be ceased, and a referral to a nephrologist considered. In general, combined therapy with ACE inhibitor and ARB is not recommended. Caution should be exercised if baseline potassium is ≥5. 5 mmol/L, as rises in serum potassium of approximately 0. 5 mmol/L are expected (see ). ACE inhibitors or ARBs can be safely prescribed at all stages of CKD and should not be ceased as GFR progressively declines but continued if tolerated. 76 Calcium May be used for people with angina, the elderly and those channel with systolic hypertension. blockers Diuretics (e. g. , Loop diuretics are effective in all stages of CKD including thiazides and when GFR is severely reduced to 30 mL/min/1. 73m2. loop diuretics) Typical doses are 20-120 mg/day, but higher doses (up to 500 mg/day) may be required, especially at lower levels of eGFR. When more than 80 mg/d is required, the efficacy is improved by dividing the daily dose.

When more than 80 mg/d is required, the efficacy is improved by dividing the daily dose. Thiazides can be effective at low levels of eGFR, particularly in combination with loop diuretics. For more information on managing oedema, see. 55 Medication Notes on use in people with CKD Beta-blockers Beta-blockers are useful agents for blood pressure control in people with CKD. For use of beta-blockers in heart failure, refer to the National Heart Foundation Australia guidelines. 77 Steroidal MRA Steroidal MRAs may be used for people with concomitant heart failure or hypertension. Use with caution in CKD and in combination with RAS blockade, due to risk of decline in eGFR and hyperkalaemia. Non-steroidal MRAs can be safely used in the setting of type 2 diabetes and CKD. Steroidal and nonsteroidal MRAs should not be prescribed together. For both agents, it is recommended to monitor potassium carefully. Clinical tip ACE inhibitors, ARBs, SGLT2 inhibitors and diuretics should be temporarily discontinued during acute illness, especially in the context of sepsis, hypovolaemia, or hypotension, and recommenced when the condition stabilises. Clinical tip ACE inhibitors and ARBs cause a reversible reduction in glomerular blood flow and GFR can decline when treatment is initiated. Check eGFR within 2 weeks following initiation. Provided the reduction is less than 25% within two weeks of starting therapy, the ACE inhibitor or ARB should be continued. If the reduction in GFR is greater than 25% below the baseline value, the ACE inhibitor or ARB should be ceased, and referral to a nephrologist considered.

It is caused by the accumulation of the breakdown products of protein metabolism. The symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and in the advanced stages confusion (encephalopathy), muscle twitching, pericarditis, fluid overload, convulsions, and coma. Although urea and creatinine are the substances measured, the symptoms are most likely due to the accumulation of other unmeasured toxic end products. By the time uraemia becomes symptomatic, dialysis is typically indicated. Management Dialysis should be commenced based on assessment of uraemic symptoms, not eGFR or biochemistry. If non-dialysis pathway is planned, the patient should be reviewed by a specialist kidney supportive care team for assessment of symptoms and nondialysis therapies. These may include dietary modifications, fluid restriction, anti-emetics, and therapy to address pruritus. 71 5 Progressive CKD 72 Kidney Health Australia Indications for referral to a nephrologist32, 110 Appropriate referral is associated with positive outcomes, including: Reduced rate of progression to kidney failure. Decreased morbidity and mortality. Decreased need for and duration of hospitalisation. Increased likelihood of timely preparation of permanent dialysis access prior to dialysis onset. Increased likelihood of kidney transplantation. Tests recommended prior to referral: Current blood chemistry and haematology uACR and urine microscopy for red cell morphology Current and historical blood pressure /- Kidneys Ureters Bladder ultrasound scan Clinical tip Anyone with a rapidly declining eGFR (5 mL/min/1. 73m2 over 3 months) and/or signs of acute nephritis (oliguria, haematuria, acute hypertension, and oedema) should be regarded as a medical emergency and referred without delay.

STAGE 5 Kidney Transplant What you need to know Stages of chronic kidney disease There are 5 stages of kidney disease as shown in the table below. Your healthcare provider will tell you the stage of kidney disease, based on how well your kidneys are working and your estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The eGFR number comes from a lab test that measures the amount of blood your kidneys are filtering each minute. As CKD gets worse, the eGFR number goes down. STAGES OF KIDNEY DISEASE ESTIMATED GLOMERULAR FILTRATION KIDNEY STAGE DESCRIPTION RATE (eGFR) FUNCTION Kidney damage (e. g. , protein 1 in the urine) with normal 90 or above 90100% kidney function Kidney damage with mild 2 60 to 89 loss of kidney function 6089% Mild to moderate loss of 3a 45 to 59 kidney function 4559% Moderate to severe loss of 3b 30 to 44 kidney function 3044% Severe loss of kidney 4 15 to 29 function 1529% 5 Kidney failure Less than 15 Less than 15% 2 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Contents About Kidney Transplantation. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 Getting a Transplant. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 After Your Transplant. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 About Organ Donation. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 Finding a Living Donor. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 Five Ways to Inspire Living Kidney Donation. . . . . . . . 25 Where can I find more information? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27 KIDNEY. ORG 3 About Kidney Transplantation When your kidneys fail, treatment is needed to replace the work your own kidneys can no longer do. There are two types of treatment for kidney failure dialysis and kidney transplantation. This brochure can help you decide if a kidney transplant is the best choice for you. What is a kidney transplant? When you get a kidney transplant, a healthy kidney is placed inside your body to do the work your own kidneys can no longer do. Many people feel that a kidney transplant offers more freedom and a better quality of life than dialysis. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION On the plus side, there are fewer limits on what you can eat and drink, but you should follow a hearthealthy diet. Your health and energy should improve.

Many people feel that a kidney transplant offers more freedom and a better quality of life than dialysis. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION On the plus side, there are fewer limits on what you can eat and drink, but you should follow a hearthealthy diet. Your health and energy should improve. In fact, a successful kidney transplant may allow you to live the kind of life you were living before you got kidney disease. Studies show that people with kidney transplants live longer than those who remain on dialysis. On the minus side, there are the risks of surgery. You will also need to take anti-rejection medicines for as long as your new kidney is working, which can have side effects. You will have a higher risk for infections and certain types of cancer. Although most transplants are successful and last for many years, how long they last can vary from one person to the next. Many people will need more than one kidney transplant during their lifetime. What is a preemptive or early transplant? Getting a transplant before you need to start dialysis is called a preemptive transplant. It allows you to avoid dialysis altogether. Getting a transplant not long after kidneys fail (but with some time on dialysis) is referred to as an early transplant. Both have benefits. Some research shows that a preemptive or early transplant, with little or no time spent on dialysis, can lead to better long-term health. It may also allow you to keep working, save time and money, and have a better quality of life. KIDNEY. ORG 5 Who can get a kidney transplant? Kidney patients of all agesfrom children to seniors can get a transplant. You must be healthy enough to have the operation. You must also be free from cancer and infection. Every person being considered for transplant will get a full medical and psychosocial evaluation to make sure they are a good candidate for transplant. The evaluation helps find any problems, so they can be corrected before transplant. For most people, getting a transplant can be a good treatment choice. What if Im older or have other health problems? In many cases, people who are older or have other health conditions like diabetes can still have successful kidney transplants. Careful evaluation is needed to understand and deal with any special risks. You may be asked to do some things that can lessen certain risks and improve the chances of a successful transplant. For example, you may be asked to lose weight or quit smoking. If you have diabetes, you may also be able to have a pancreas transplant. Ask your healthcare professional about getting a pancreas transplant along with a kidney transplant. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How will I pay for a transplant? Medicare covers about 80% of the costs associated with an evaluation, transplant operation, follow-up care, and anti-rejection medicines. Private insurers and state programs may cover some costs as well.

The donated kidney is placed into your lower abdomen (belly), where its easiest to connect it to your important blood vessels and bladder. Putting the new kidney in your abdomen also makes it easier to take care of any problems that might come up. The operation takes about four hours. Youll be sore at first, but you should be out of bed in a day or so, and home within a week. If the kidney came from a living donor, it should start to work very quickly. A 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION kidney from a deceased donor can take longer to start workingtwo to four weeks or more. If that happens, you may need dialysis until the kidney begins to work. After surgery, youll be taught about the medicines youll have to take and their side effects. Youll also learn about diet. If youve been on dialysis, youll find that there are fewer restrictions on what you can eat and drink, which is one of the benefits of a transplant. What are anti-rejection medicines? Normally, your body fights off anything that isnt part of itself, like germs and viruses. This system of protection is called your immune system. To stop your body from attacking or rejecting the donated kidney, you will have to take medicines to keep your immune system less active (called anti-rejection medicines or immunosuppressive medicines). Youll need to take them as long as your new kidney is working. Without them, your immune system would see the donated kidney as foreign, and would attack and destroy it. Anti-rejection medicines can have some side effects. It is important to talk to your healthcare provider about them, so that you know what to expect. Fortunately, for most people, side effects are usually manageable. Changing the dose or type of medicine can often ease some of the side effects. KIDNEY. ORG 11 Besides the immunosuppressive medicines, you will take other medicines as well. You will take medicines to protect you from infection, too. Most people find taking medicines a small trade for the freedom and quality of life that a successful transplant can provide. Important Reminder You must not take any medicine or nutritional supplement that is not approved by your transplant team because of the risk of interaction with your anti-rejection medicines. 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION After Your Transplant What happens after I go home? Once you are home from the hospital, the most important work beginsthe follow-up. For your transplant to be successful, you will have regular checkups, especially during the first year. At first, you may need blood tests several times a week. After that, youll need fewer checkups, but enough to make sure that your kidney is working well and that you have the right amount of anti-rejection medication in your body. What if my body tries to reject the new kidney?

Certain medications that can harm a developing baby must be stopped six weeks before trying to get pregnant. Birth control counseling may be helpful. Its important to protect yourself against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Be sure to use protection during sexual activity. Will I need to follow a special diet? In general, transplant recipients should eat a hearthealthy diet (low fat, low salt) and drink plenty of fluids. If you have diabetes or other health problems, you may still have some dietary restrictions. A dietitian can help you plan meals that are right for you. KIDNEY. ORG 15 About Organ Donation Where do donated kidneys come from? A donated kidney may come from someone who died and donated a healthy kidney. A person who has died and donated a kidney is called a deceased donor. Donated kidneys also can come from a living donor. This person may be a blood relative (like a brother or sister) or non-blood relative (like a husband or wife). They can also come from a friend or even a stranger. When a kidney is donated by a living person, the operations are done on the same day and can be scheduled at a convenient time for both the patient and the donor. A healthy person who donates a kidney can live a normal life with the one kidney that is left. But the operation is major surgery for the donor, as well as the recipient. As in any operation, there are some risks that you will need to consider. 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Is it better to get a kidney from a living donor? Kidneys from living or deceased donors both work well, but getting a kidney from a living donor can work faster and be better. A kidney from a living donor may last longer than one from a deceased donor. To get a deceased donor kidney, you will be placed on a waiting list once you have been cleared for a transplant. It can take many years for a donor kidney to be offered to you. From the time you go on the list until a kidney is found, you may have to be on some form of dialysis. While youre waiting, youll need regular blood tests to make sure you are ready when a kidney is found. If youre on dialysis, your center will make the arrangements for these tests. Your transplant center should know how to reach you at all times. Once a kidney become available, the surgery must be done as soon as possible. KIDNEY. ORG 17 Are there disadvantages to living donation? A disadvantage of living donation is that a healthy person must undergo surgery to remove a healthy kidney. The donor will need some recovery time before returning to work and other activities. However, recent advances in surgery (often called minimally invasive or laparoroscopic surgery) allow for very small incisions. This means shorter hospital stays and recovery time, less pain, and a quicker return to usual activities.

The donor will need some recovery time before returning to work and other activities. However, recent advances in surgery (often called minimally invasive or laparoroscopic surgery) allow for very small incisions. This means shorter hospital stays and recovery time, less pain, and a quicker return to usual activities. Living donors often experience positive feelings about their courageous gift. What are the financial costs to the living donor? The surgery and evaluation is covered by Medicare or the recipients insurance. The living donor will not pay for anything related to the surgery. However, neither Medicare nor insurance covers time off from work, travel expenses, lodging, or other incidentals. The National Living Donor Assistance Program (livingdonorassistance. org) or other programs may help cover travel and lodging costs. Donors may be eligible for sick leave, state disability, and benefits under the federal Family Medical Leave Act. In addition, federal employees, some state employees, and certain other workers may be eligible for 30 days paid leave. 18 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Finding a Living Donor How do I ask someone to consider donating a kidney to me? Asking someone to donate a kidney to you can feel scary and overwhelming. You may be asking yourself, Where do I start? How do I ask? Here are some suggestions to help make it easier for you. LEARN ALL YOU CAN. The first step is to learn as much as you can about living kidney donation and transplant. This will help you explain it to your friends and family. You may want to let people know that theres no cure for kidney disease and tell them about your options for treating your condition. KIDNEY. ORG 19 Sharing as many facts as you can, along with your thoughts about your condition and treatment options, is one way to open a conversation. A friend or family member might be willing to help you talk to others about your needsdont be afraid to ask! This may relieve some pressure of having to ask people directly. Discussing your need for a kidney in everyday conversation helps get the word outand makes people more comfortable asking you questions about your health. Go to kidney. org/livingdonation RAISE AWARENESSSHARE YOUR STORY! Sharing your story is very important. You should speak from the heart, and tell people as much as you can about kidney disease. If you are on dialysis, you could include details about what a typical week is like for you on dialysis, the complications caused by kidney disease, and why a transplant is a better longterm option for you. Remember, no one will offer to help unless they understand the need. As you share your story and describe what its like to live with kidney disease, try to be open and honest about your situation and your feelings. In sharing your story, you might be fortunate enough to get offers from people who are willing to be tested as a match.

Asking for help can be daunting to some, but you can start by telling your story. This opens the lines of communication. Many people in your circle may not know about your condition or that being a living kidney donor is even an option. By starting a dialogue and educating those around you, you may find that many people will ask how they can help. Ask your family and friends to spread the word. Its important to keep your options open as you never know when a potential donor is going to walk through the door! 24 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How do I write a letter or email to my friends and family? One way to spread the word is to share your story by letter or email. Here are some tips for writing to your friends, family, or community: Make it personal; tell your story (what is treatment like, how do you feel). Use information on kidney. org to include facts on kidney disease, living donation, and transplant. Invite people to learn more and provide contact details. Ask your transplant center if they want their contact number posted in your letters. They may have a special line, or prefer that people call you first. KIDNEY. ORG 25 SAMPLE LETTER Dear Friends, Some of you may know that I have kidney disease. Over time, my kidney disease has gotten worse, causing my kidneys not to work well enough to keep me alive. This is what I am facing now, and my treatment options are limited to dialysis treatments or a kidney transplant. Getting regular dialysis treatments, usually three times a week for four hours at a time, will help my kidneys do their job and keep me alive, but a transplant would offer me more freedom and the ability to live a longer, healthier, more normal life. A transplant would also give me more time to do the fun things I enjoy most, like spending time with my family and friends. However, finding a kidney for a transplant is not easy. Just ask the 130, 000 people on the waiting list for a deceased donor kidney like me. Time is not on our side. Some wait for years; many die while waiting. The 26 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION average wait time is five years or more for a kidney from a deceased donor. However, there is another option: receiving a kidney from a living donor. Asking a family member or a friend to consider donating a kidney to me is difficult, but it greatly improves my chances of getting a transplant. A living kidney donation typically lasts longer and has better function. You might not know a lot about living donationI know I didnt before kidney disease affected my life. Understandably, some people are afraid about the surgery and what living with one kidney will mean for them. Heres some basic information about kidney donation: You only need one kidney to live a healthy, long life.

KIDNEY. ORG 3 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How does my doctor diagnose kidney cancer? Your doctor will diagnose kidney cancer by reviewing your medical history and doing a physical exam, along with blood and urine tests. You will also have one or a few of these imaging tests: Computed tomography (CT) scans use x-rays to make a complete picture of the kidneys and abdomen (belly). They can be done with or without a contrast dye. Small amounts of radiation are used. The CT scan often shows if a tumor appears cancerous or if it has spread beyond the kidney. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans make a complete picture of the kidneys and abdomen, but without radiation. They can be done with or without a contrast dye called gadolinium that should be avoided in people on dialysis or with very low kidney function. An MRI can cost more than CT scans, take more time to do, and the pictures may not be as clear. Ultrasound uses sound waves to give a complete picture of the kidneys and abdomen without radiation. It may be useful in helping to decide if a mass in the kidneys is a fluid-filled cyst or a solid tumor. This test is done without contrast dye. A biopsy can be used in special cases, but is typically not recommended. A biopsy requires a very small piece of the kidney to be removed with a needle and then tested for cancer cells. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 5 STAGES OF KIDNEY CANCER Once kidney cancer is found, your doctor will run tests to find out if the cancer has spread within the kidney or to other parts of the body. This process is called staging. It is important to know the stage before making a treatment plan. The higher the stage, the more serious the cancer. Stage Description The tumor is 7 centimeters (cm), which is 1 about 23/4 or smaller, and is found only in the kidney. The tumor is larger than 7 centimeters (cm) 2 and is found only in the kidney. Cancer is found in the main blood vessels of the kidney or in the layer of fatty tissue around the kidney. 3 OR The tumor is any size and cancer is found only in the kidney and in 1 or more nearby lymph nodes. Cancer has spread beyond the layer of fatty tissue around the kidney and may be found in the adrenal gland above the kidney with 4 cancer, or in nearby lymph nodes; or to other organs, such as the lungs, liver, bones, or brain, and may have spread to lymph nodes. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION What is the treatment for kidney cancer? Treatment depends on your stage of kidney cancer, general health, age, and other factors. Your treatment can include one or more of the following options: Surgery is the most common treatment for kidney cancer most people with early stage cancer (stages 1, 2, and 3) can be cured with surgery.

Treatment depends on your stage of kidney cancer, general health, age, and other factors. Your treatment can include one or more of the following options: Surgery is the most common treatment for kidney cancer most people with early stage cancer (stages 1, 2, and 3) can be cured with surgery. Partial nephrectomy: Only the tumor or the part of the kidney with the tumor is removed to leave behind as much of the kidney as possible. Radical nephrectomy: The entire kidney is removed. If needed, the surrounding tissues and lymph nodes may also be removed. Ask your doctor about the surgical approach that is best for you: Open (traditional surgery with a long incision); Laparoscopic (surgery done with a video camera and thin instruments for smaller incisions); and Robotic (laparoscopic surgery done with the help of a robot). Thermal ablation kills the tumor by burning or freezing it. It is most often used for small tumors in people who are not good candidates for nephrectomy surgery. Active surveillance is used if a small tumor is less than 4 centimeters (1 ½ inches). Most small tumors grow slowly and they may also not be cancerous. You will need regular monitoring and testing. 7 Treatment with medicine is often used for advanced kidney cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or where surgery cannot be done. Immunotherapy uses the bodys defense system (immune system) to stop or slow the growth of cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies attack a specific part of cancer cells. Checkpoint inhibitors help the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. Vaccines and other immunotherapies give an overall boost to the immune system. Anti-angiogenic therapies reduce the blood supply to a tumor to slow or stop its growth. Targeted therapies directly inhibit the growth of the cancer. Chemotherapy and radiation used for other types of cancer do not usually do a good job of treating most forms of kidney cancer. 8 Important Steps to Reduce Your Risk for Kidney Cancer Dont smoke. Maintain a healthy weight. Find out if youre exposed to certain toxins at work or at home. Some toxins that may increase the risk for kidney cancer include cadmium, asbestos, and trichloroethylene. Take care of your kidneyspeople with kidney disease may be at increased risk for kidney cancer: Ask your healthcare provider about 2 simple tests to find your kidney score: A blood test for kidney function called GFR A urine test for kidney damage called ACR. Avoid prolonged use of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Control high blood pressure. Control your blood sugar if you have diabetes. Be aware of certain risk factors that cant be changed, but should be followed up on: Family history of kidney cancer Certain diseases you may have been born with, such as von Hippel-Lindau disease 9 Important Steps If You Have Kidney Cancer Discuss all your treatment options with your medical team.

Understand that you may need at least several opinions about what treatment choices are best for you. Maintain good nutrition during treatment so that you get enough calories, protein, and other nutrients to help prevent weight loss and to stay strong. Patients who eat well often feel better and have more energy. Protect your kidneys people with kidney cancer may be at increased risk for kidney disease. Control blood pressure and blood sugar, avoid NSAIDs, dont smoke, stay physically active, and follow a healthy diet. 10 What is kidney disease? Your kidneys main job is to clean waste and extra water from your blood. Having kidney disease means your kidneys are damaged and cannot do this job well. Over time, kidney disease can get worse and lead to kidney failure. Once kidneys fail, treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed to stay alive. Kidney disease can be found with a simple blood test and urine test during a routine office visit with your healthcare professional. 2 Simple Tests to Check Major Risk Factors Include for Kidney Disease Urine Test Diabetes You could help save your kidneys with a simple urine test. Ask your doctor about Albumin Creatinine Ratio (ACR) which estimates the amount of a type of protein, High Blood Pressure albumin, this is in the urine. Blood Test Age 60 and older The Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) tells how well your kidneys are working to reove wastes from your blood. It is the best way to check kidney function. Over 90 is good. 60-89 should be monitored. Less than 60 for 3 months indicates kidney disease. 11 Are kidney cancer and kidney disease related? Studies show there is a link between kidney cancer and kidney disease. Some studies show that people with kidney disease may have a higher risk for kidney cancer. Some reasons are: Long-term dialysis: Some studies show that people on long-term dialysis have a 5-fold increased risk for kidney cancer. Experts believe this risk is due to kidney disease rather than dialysis. Immunosuppressant medicines: Some anti-rejection medicines that must be taken by kidney transplant recipients to prevent rejection can increase your risk for kidney cancer. However, taking your immunosuppressant medicine is important if you have a transplant. Without it, your body will reject your new kidney. On the other hand, about one-third of the 300, 000 kidney cancer survivors in the United States have or will develop kidney disease. 1, 2 Some reasons are: Surgery to remove an entire kidney (radical nephrectomy): Sometimes the entire kidney needs to be removed because the tumor is so large and most of the kidney has been destroyed.

MANAGING ANEMIA When You Have Kidney Disease or Kidney Failure www. kidney. org About the Information in this Booklet Did you know that the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) offers guidelines and commentaries that help your healthcare provider make decisions about your medical treatment? The information in this booklet is based on those recommended guidelines. Stages of Kidney Disease There are five stages of kidney disease. They are shown in the table below. Your healthcare provider determines your stage of kidney disease, based on the presence of kidney damage and your glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is a measure of your kidney function. Your treatment is based on your stage of kidney disease. Speak to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your stage of kidney disease or your treatment. STAGES OF KIDNEY DISEASE Glomerular Stage Description Filtration Rate (GFR) Kidney damage (e. g. , protein 1 90 or above in the urine) with normal GFR Kidney damage with mild 2 60 to 89 decrease in GFR 3 Moderate decrease in GFR 30 to 59 4 Severe reduction in GFR 15 to 29 5 Kidney failure Less than 15 Your GFR number tells your healthcare provider how much kidney function you have.

Before starting treatment for anemia, your healthcare provider will order tests to find the exact cause. Why do people with kidney disease or kidney failure get anemia? Your kidneys make an important hormone called erythropoietin (EPO). Hormones are chemical messengers that your body makes to help your body work and keep you healthy. EPO tells your body to make red blood cells. When you have kidney disease or kidney failure, your kidneys cannot make enough EPO. This causes your red blood cell count to drop and anemia to develop. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 7 Do you knowT itphese words? Not having enough EPO (a hormone made by your kidneys) is the most common cause of anemia in patients with kidney disease and kidney failure. EPO tells your body to make red blood cells. When your kidneys no longer make enough EPO, treatment with drugs called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) can help. What are kidney disease and kidney failure? Healthy kidneys do many important jobs. Among other things, they remove waste products and extra water from your body. They also help make red blood cells. If you have kidney disease, it means your kidneys are damaged. They cannot do these important jobs well. Kidneys can become damaged from a physical injury or a disease like diabetes, high blood pressure, or other disorders. Treatment can help keep kidney disease from getting worse. But if kidney disease does get worse, it can lead to kidney failure. 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION If you have kidney failure, it means your kidneys do not work well enough to keep you alive. You must have dialysis treatment for the rest of your life, or a kidney transplant. There are two types of dialysis hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. To learn more about a kidney transplant or dialysis, ask your healthcare provider or call the NKF Cares Patient Help Line toll-free at 855. NKF. CARES (855. 653. 2273) or email nkfcareskidney. org. Is everyone with kidney disease or kidney failure at risk for anemia? Most people with kidney disease or kidney failure will get anemia. Anemia can happen early in the course of kidney disease and grow worse as kidneys lose their ability to work well and make EPO. Anemia is especially common if you: Have diabetes Are Black Have moderate or severe loss of kidney function (stage 3 or 4) Have kidney failure (stage 5) Are female WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 9 Do you knowT itphese words? If you are Black or have diabetes along with kidney disease, you are more likely to get anemia and at an earlier stage. How do I know if I have anemia? Not everyone with anemia has symptoms. If you have kidney disease or kidney failure, you should have a simple blood test to measure your hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen through your body. If your hemoglobin is lower than the normal range (which is 12. 0 for women and 13.

If you have kidney disease or kidney failure, you should have a simple blood test to measure your hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen through your body. If your hemoglobin is lower than the normal range (which is 12. 0 for women and 13. 5 for men), it is likely you have anemia. In that case, your healthcare provider will check to find out what caused your anemia and develop a treatment. Do you knowT itphese words? Speak to your healthcare provider if you think you have anemia. Make a list of questions. Write down your symptoms, allergies, medications, and previous health problems. Show the list to your healthcare provider. Discuss how you are feeling and ask questions. 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How often should I be checked for anemia? How often you are checked for anemia depends on many things, including your stage of kidney disease. In general, you should be checked for anemia at least once per year. Some people may need to be checked more often. How is anemia treated? Your treatment will depend on what caused your anemia. If your anemia is due to kidney disease or kidney failure, you may be treated with: Drugs called erythropoiesisstimulating agents (ESAs) ESAs help your body make red blood cells. ESAs are usually given to you as an injection under the skin in your healthcare providers office. This is called a subcutaneous injection or SC. Extra iron Your body needs iron to make red blood cells, especially when you are receiving ESAs. Without enough iron, your ESA treatment will not work as well. Iron can be given to you as a pill, or administered directly into a vein WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 11 in your healthcare providers office (called intravenous iron or IV iron). For most people, IV iron works best. You and your healthcare provider will decide which method is best for you. Do you knowT itphese words? If you are on hemodialysis, your ESA and extra iron can be given to you as an injection into the blood tubes during your dialysis treatment. You and your healthcare team will decide which method is best for you. What is the goal of anemia treatment? The goal is to increase your hemoglobin level to a range that works best for you. This range is different for everyone. Your healthcare provider will decide what is best and safest. As you get closer to your range, you should have more energy and feel less tired. Another goal is to keep you from needing blood transfusions. They could interfere with having a successful kidney transplant in the future. 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How much ESA will I need? You will be given enough ESA to increase your hemoglobin gradually.

Another goal is to keep you from needing blood transfusions. They could interfere with having a successful kidney transplant in the future. 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How much ESA will I need? You will be given enough ESA to increase your hemoglobin gradually. How much ESA you need and how often you receive it depends on: Your current hemoglobin level How well you respond to treatment with ESA How you receive your ESAas an injection under the skin or through the blood tubes during dialysis The type of ESA you receive There are different types of ESAs availableshort-acting ESAs or long-lasting ESAs. You and your healthcare provider will decide which type is best for you. How will my healthcare provider know if I am responding to ESA? Your healthcare provider will check your hemoglobin level regularly. This shows how well you are doing. Your dose of ESA may need to be changed, depending on how well you respond to your treatment. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 13 Will I need extra iron? Your body needs iron to make red blood cells. Once you start taking an ESA, your body will make more red blood cells, and your bodys iron supply will be used up faster. Without extra iron, your ESA treatment will not work as well. Do you knowT itphese words? Not everyone with kidney disease will need treatment with ESAs. For some people with early kidney disease, taking extra iron may be enough to boost your bodys ability to make red blood cells. How much iron will I need? Your healthcare provider will decide how much iron you need and how often you get it, based on your hemoglobin level, ESA dose, and the results of your iron tests. The goal of taking extra iron is to reach a hemoglobin range that is best and safest for you. 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How is my iron level tested? Two important tests can tell if you have enough iron. They are called transferrin saturation (TSAT) and ferritin. You may need extra iron if these test results show that your TSAT or ferritin result is low. How often will my iron level be tested? If you are being treated for anemia with an ESA, your iron should be tested every 3 months until your anemia is under control. Can diet help my anemia? Eating foods that are high in iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid may be difficult due to your kidney diet. A dietitian can help you plan meals and suggest a renal vitamin if needed. Check with your healthcare provider before making any changes to your diet. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 15 Do you knowFa tchtese words? Iron is important in treating anemia. Without enough iron, ESA is wasted and you will not reach your target hemoglobin. What if my anemia isnt treated? Anemia can cause serious health problems. Your heart must work harder if you do not have enough red blood cells. This can lead to heart disease.

Without enough iron, ESA is wasted and you will not reach your target hemoglobin. What if my anemia isnt treated? Anemia can cause serious health problems. Your heart must work harder if you do not have enough red blood cells. This can lead to heart disease. Unfortunately, many people with kidney disease develop heart disease long before they reach kidney failure. Some will even die from it. Early treatment of anemia is important. It can help keep heart disease and other problems from happening. If you already have heart disease, treatment can help keep it from getting worse. What if I have a kidney transplant? Unfortunately, even a new kidney may not be able to make all the EPO you need to make enough red blood cells. You will need to take special drugs to keep your body from rejecting the new kidney. These drugs can affect EPO production. So, treatment for anemia is often needed even after a successful transplant. 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Do you knowFa tchtese words? Treating anemia is important because: Your chances of having serious, life-threatening heart problems will be lowered You will have more energy to do your daily tasks Your quality of life gets better Your ability to exercise improves You may avoid blood transfusions WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 17 Key Points to Remember Anemia happens when your body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Most people with kidney disease or kidney failure will develop anemia. Anemia can be treated. Drugs called ESAs and extra iron are used to treat anemia. They help your body make red blood cells. Treatment of anemia is important. It can help keep heart disease and other problems from happening. If you already have heart disease, it can help keep it from getting worse.

MANAGING IRON When You Have Kidney Disease or Kidney Failure www. kidney. org COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. About the Information in this Booklet Did you know that the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) offers guidelines and commentaries that help your healthcare provider make decisions about your medical treatment? The information in this booklet is based on those recommended guidelines. Stages of Kidney Disease There are five stages of kidney disease. They are shown in the table below. Your healthcare provider determines your stage of kidney disease, based on the presence of kidney damage and your glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is a measure of your kidney function. Your treatment is based on your stage of kidney disease. Speak to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your stage of kidney disease or your treatment. STAGES OF KIDNEY DISEASE Glomerular Stage Description Filtration Rate (GFR) Kidney damage (e. g. , protein 1 90 or above in the urine) with normal GFR Kidney damage with mild 2 60 to 89 decrease in GFR 3 Moderate decrease in GFR 30 to 59 4 Severe reduction in GFR 15 to 29 5 Kidney failure Less than 15 Your GFR number tells your healthcare provider how much kidney function you have. As chronic kidney disease progresses, your GFR number decreases. COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE.

If you have chronic kidney disease or kidney failure, your body may be lacking an important mineral called iron. This booklet will answer some common questions about iron, and how important it is to have healthy iron levels. What is iron? Iron is a mineral needed for healthy blood cells and for overall good health. Iron is found in a wide variety of foods. You can also get iron from supplements taken by mouth and from iron medicines prescribed by your healthcare provider. What does iron do? Iron helps your body in many ways. One way is to help make red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body. They give you the energy you need for your daily activities. The kidneys tell your body to make red blood cells. Iron helps make red blood cells healthy. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. What is kidney disease? Your kidneys do many important jobs. They remove waste products and extra fluid from your body and help make red blood cells. They also help to keep the right amounts of minerals in your blood. Minerals are nutrients that you get from food. Your body needs them to work properly. When you have kidney disease, it means your kidneys are damaged. They cannot do these jobs very well. In the early stages of kidney disease, most people do not have any symptoms. You may not be aware that your kidney function is reduced. If kidney disease gets worse, waste products can build up to high levels in your blood and make you feel sick. This may happen slowly over a long period of time. People with kidney disease may develop other health problems as well. These may include high blood pressure, heart disease, anemia (low red blood cell count), weak bones, and poor nutrition. Do you know these words? Some words that are used in this booklet may be new to you. To help you get to know them, theres a list of Words to Know at the end of this booklet. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 5 COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. Finding and treating kidney disease early is important. With treatment, it may be possible to keep kidney disease from getting worse. If kidney disease continues to get worse, it can lead to kidney failure. What is kidney failure? Kidney failure means your kidneys do not work well enough to keep you alive. You will need treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant to live. Dialysis is a process that filters waste products and extra fluid from your blood when your kidneys cannot. There are two types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. A kidney transplant is an operation that places a healthy kidney into your body.

Dialysis is a process that filters waste products and extra fluid from your blood when your kidneys cannot. There are two types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. A kidney transplant is an operation that places a healthy kidney into your body. FACT Your kidneys make an important hormone called erythropoietin (EPO). EPO tells your body to make red blood cells. When you have kidney disease or kidney failure, you may not be able to make enough EPO. As a result, your body makes less red blood cells and anemia can develop. Some people with kidney disease need a medicine called an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) to do the work of EPO. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. Why is iron important? Your body needs iron to make red blood cells. Without enough iron, you may get anemia. Anemia means you do not have enough red blood cells. As a result, your blood cannot carry enough oxygen through your body. Making sure you have enough iron helps to correct anemia. How much iron do I need? You need enough iron to keep a healthy hemoglobin level. Hemoglobin is part of your red blood cells. Its the part that carries oxygen through your body. Hemoglobin is made up of oxygen and iron. Therefore, one way to know if your body has enough iron is to measure how much hemoglobin is in your blood. The normal hemoglobin level is 12. 0 for women and 13. 5 for men. How else is my iron level tested? Two important tests can tell if you have enough iron. They are called transferrin saturation (TSAT) and ferritin. You may need extra iron if the results of these tests show that your TSAT and ferritin are low. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 7 COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. How will I feel if my iron level is low? If your iron level is low, you may have low hemoglobin. This can cause you to: Look pale Feel more tired or weak Feel down or depressed Feel short of breath with activity Have chest pain Feel dizzy or light-headed Feel numbness or coldness in your hands and feet Have a faster heartbeat TIP Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any of the symptoms listed above. Write down how you feel, your allergies, medications, previous medical procedures, and any health problems. Discuss how you are feeling. Ask your healthcare provider: Do I have enough iron? What can I do to feel better? 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. If I have kidney disease, what is the treatment for low iron? If you have low iron and low hemoglobin, your doctor will develop a treatment plan that is right for you. One or more of the following may be suggested: Eating more foods that have iron such as red meat, leafy green vegetables, and eggs.

If you have low iron and low hemoglobin, your doctor will develop a treatment plan that is right for you. One or more of the following may be suggested: Eating more foods that have iron such as red meat, leafy green vegetables, and eggs. However, eating foods that are rich in iron may be hard due to your kidney diet. A dietitian can help you plan meals that include iron and other minerals. Iron supplements by mouth in tablet or liquid form. A vitamin and mineral supplement with iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid. Your dietitian or healthcare provider will help you choose one that is right for people with kidney disease. Iron medicine given by injection into a vein during visits to your healthcare providers office or clinic. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 9 COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. TIP Iron supplements can affect other medicines you may be taking. Talk to your healthcare provider, dietitian, or pharmacist before taking iron tablets or liquid supplements. If I have kidney failure, what is the treatment for low iron? If you have kidney failure, you can take extra iron by mouth or have it injected into a vein at the healthcare providers office (called intravenous iron or IV iron). You and your healthcare provider will decide which method is best for you. Most people on dialysis need extra iron because: Lack of iron-rich foods in your diet. Foods that are rich in iron, like red meats and beans, may be limited in your dialysis diet. Without enough iron-rich foods, you are more at risk for low iron. A dietitian can help you choose foods that are good sources of iron, vitamins, and other minerals. Check with your dietitian before making any changes in your diet. 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. Blood loss during dialysis. At the end of each hemodialysis treatment a small amount of blood is usually left behind in the dialyzer (artificial kidney). This can be a source of iron loss over time. TIP If you are receiving hemodialysis, IV iron can be given to you as an injection into the blood tubes during your hemodialysis treatment. Is IV iron safe? IV iron is safe for most people. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about IV iron. Tell them about any medicines that you are allergic to. On rare occasions, some people may have a reaction to IV iron. Reactions may include low blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 11 COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. Where can I get more information?

MINERAL AND BONE DISORDER If you have kidney disease or kidney failure www. kidney. org COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. About the Information in this Booklet Did you know that the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) offers guidelines and commentaries that help your healthcare provider make decisions about your medical treatment? The information in this booklet is based on those recommended guidelines. Stages of Kidney Disease There are five stages of kidney disease. They are shown in the table below. Your healthcare provider determines your stage of kidney disease, based on the presence of kidney damage and your glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is a measure of your kidney function. Your treatment is based on your stage of kidney disease. Speak to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your stage of kidney disease or your treatment. STAGES OF KIDNEY DISEASE Stage Description Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) Kidney damage (e. g. , protein 1 90 or above in the urine) with normal GFR Kidney damage with mild 2 60 to 89 decrease in GFR 3 Moderate decrease in GFR 30 to 59 4 Severe reduction in GFR 15 to 29 5 Kidney failure Less than 15 Your GFR number tells your healthcare provider how much kidney function you have. As chronic kidney disease progresses, your GFR number decreases. 2 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE.

DO NOT REPRODUCE. Introduction Healthy kidneys do many important jobs. They remove wastes and extra fluid from your body, help make red blood cells, and help keep bones strong. They also help to keep the right amount of minerals in your blood. Minerals are nutrients that your body needs to stay healthy. When you have kidney disease, your kidneys cannot do these important jobs well. As a result, you may develop mineral and bone disorder. It is a common problem in people with kidney disease and it affects almost everyone receiving dialysis. What is mineral and bone disorder? Kidney disease and kidney failure can cause important minerals in your blood stream, such as calcium and phosphorus, to get out of balance. Minerals are nutrients that your body needs. As a result, bones may lose calcium and become weak over time. Some calcium and phosphorus may end up in parts of your body where they do not belong, like your heart and blood vessels. This can lead to heart disease. Finding and treating mineral and bone disorder is important. It will help you keep your bones and heart healthy. Do you know these words?

Blood tests can measure the amount of calcium, phosphorus, active vitamin D, and PTH in your blood. This helps determine whether you have mineral and bone disorder. How often these tests are done is different for different people. TIP Know your lab results for calcium, phosphorus, and other important tests. If any of these tests are ordered, ask about the results of your blood tests. Write down the numbers in a lab tracking sheet. You can see how the results change over time. To download a lab tracking sheet, go to www. kidney. org/AtoZGuide. 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. What tests tell about heart and blood vessel problems? Some people may need an x-ray to look at the blood vessels and heart for signs of hardening and deposits of calcium. Another test called an echocardiogram may be done if there is a concern about heart problems caused by mineral and bone disorder. Not all people will need these tests. How is mineral and bone disorder treated? Once mineral and bone disorder is found, diet and certain medications may help slow down the loss of bone and the buildup of minerals in blood vessels and the heart. Treatment will be based on the results of your tests and how quickly the results are changing. If the results change over time, your treatment may change. Diet is important for controlling minerals. Vitamins, supplements, and medicines may be prescribed. Also, treatment to control parathyroid hormone (PTH) may be needed. The goal is to slow down overactive parathyroid glands that make too much PTH. These glands can be made less active with medicine. In some cases, surgery may be needed if other treatments are not effective. This surgery (parathyroidectomy) removes the parathyroid glands that make PTH. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 11 COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. Which medicines might be prescribed in mineral and bone disorder? Common medicines for mineral and bone disorder are: Phosphate binders. If a lower-phosphorus diet does not control your blood phosphorus, you may need a medicine called a phosphate binder. Active vitamin D. If your vitamin D level is low, you may need a prescription form of active vitamin D. (If you have kidney failure and are receiving hemodialysis, your vitamin D may be given to you during your dialysis treatment. ) Calcimimetrics. Your healthcare provider may prescribe another medicine called a calcimimetric to help control mineral and bone disorder. It works differently from phosphate binders and vitamin D. It is often used when PTH, calcium, and phosphorus levels are too high. Calcium supplements. Your healthcare provider will decide if you need calcium supplements. Do not take them on your own. Note: If you are receiving dialysis, its important to know that the dialysis fluid contains calcium. Your healthcare provider will look at all the medicines you are taking for bone and mineral disorder to decide if changing the amount of calcium in your dialysis fluid could help you. Osteoporosis medicines.

Note: If you are receiving dialysis, its important to know that the dialysis fluid contains calcium. Your healthcare provider will look at all the medicines you are taking for bone and mineral disorder to decide if changing the amount of calcium in your dialysis fluid could help you. Osteoporosis medicines. Some patients have both mineral and bone disorder and the bone disease osteoporosis. Osteoporosis medicines are not always prescribed for people with kidney disease, but they may help some people. 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. More About Phosphate Binders These medicines help to keep phosphorus at the right level. Phosphate binders help stop phosphorus in foods you eat from getting into your blood. They bind to the phosphorus while it is in your digestive system. This helps your body get rid of phosphorus. Not all people with mineral and bone disorder need a phosphate binder. If you have high levels of phosphorus, your healthcare provider will talk to you about the pros and cons of using phosphate binders. Phosphate binders are not all alike. You should speak to your healthcare provider about which type of binder is best for you. To work best, your phosphate binders should be taken with food or within 10 to 15 minutes of eating. However, if you forget, be sure to take them even if you are a little late. You should take phosphate binders as instructed by your healthcare provider or dietitian. Using phosphate binders does not take the place of your lower phosphorus diet. You still have to make low-phosphorus food choices. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 13 COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. Which medicines replace active vitamin D? Synthetic forms of active vitamin D are available as pills or injections. There are several types that might be used. Do not substitute for what your healthcare provider orders. Because each type of vitamin D is a little different, your healthcare provider will decide which type is best for you. If you have kidney failure and are receiving hemodialysis, your vitamin D may be given to you during your dialysis treatment. What about calcium supplements? Some people need to take calcium supplements. Others do not. Do not take calcium supplements without checking with your healthcare provider. Results of your blood tests will guide your healthcare providers decisions about whether or not you need extra calcium. A lower phosphorus diet limits dairy foods, which are high in calcium. You need to speak to professionals who will explain how to make the healthiest food choices. A registered dietitian can help make a food plan that balances your needs for calcium, protein, and phosphorus. Some phosphate binders also contain calcium. This is why it is important not to take medicines, vitamins, supplements, or herbal pills without your healthcare provider knowing. For example, antacids can have calcium or other minerals. Before you use any antacids, ask your healthcare provider. 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE.

Make your home safer by removing things you can trip on Remove hazards like throw rugs and clutter Improve lighting Wear nonslip shoes Install handrails Key Points to Remember Mineral and bone disorder happens when the kidneys fail to keep the right amounts of calcium and phosphorus in your blood. Mineral and bone disorder is a common problem in people with kidney disease and affects almost all patients receiving dialysis. If calcium levels in the blood become too low, or phosphorus levels too high, four small glands in the neck called the parathyroid glands release a hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH). This hormone draws calcium and phosphorus from the bones and puts them into the blood stream. When this happens, bones become weaker and painful. Some of this calcium can end up in the heart and blood vessels. This increases your risk for heart disease and stroke. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 17 COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. Choosing foods that are lower in phosphorus can help you manage bone disease. Medications called phosphate binders might also be needed with meals and snacks to bind phosphorus in the bowel. Other medications might also be needed. Finding and treating mineral and bone disorder early will help you keep your bones and heart healthy. Where can you get more information? If you have more questions, speak with your healthcare team. They know you and can answer questions about your care. If you want to read more about kidney disease, the National Kidney Foundation has many other booklets that cover many subjects: Risk factors for kidney disease, like high blood pressure and diabetes Complications of kidney disease, like heart disease and anemia Information about diet and nutrition Treating kidney failure with kidney transplant or dialysis There are two ways to learn about the many free resources available to you from the National Kidney Foundation: Learn more at www. kidney. org Call the NKF Cares Patient Help Line at 855.

DO NOT REPRODUCE. Words to Know Active vitamin D: Vitamin D comes from some foods and the sun. To be used by your body, it first must be made into its active form. Healthy kidneys do this. Active vitamin D can also be given as a medicine. Another name for this is calcitriol. Bone turnover: A process in which new bone cells are made by your body and old bones cells are replaced. Calcium: A mineral needed for healthy bones. Calcium can be lost from your bones when you have kidney disease or kidney failure. Too much calcium in the blood can damage the blood vessels and heart. Dialysis: A process that filters waste products and extra fluid from your blood when your kidneys are no longer doing their job. There are two types of dialysis hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Dietitian: A professional with special training to help you plan what to eat and drink to help you feel your best. Echocardiogram: A test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart.

Echocardiogram: A test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart. Hormones: Chemical messengers produced by many different glands in your body including the kidneys to trigger certain responses in your body. Kidney disease: The loss of some or all of your kidney function. Kidney disease can result from conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, family history, or an injury to the kidneys. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 21 COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. Kidney failure: The stage of kidney disease at which dialysis or a transplant is needed to stay alive. Kidney transplant: An operation that places a healthy kidney in your body. It is one of the basic forms of treatment for kidney failure. Mineral and bone disorder: Kidney disease and kidney failure can cause important minerals, such as calcium and phosphorus, to build up in your blood stream and get out of balance. As a result, bones may lose calcium and become weak over time. Some calcium and phosphorus may end up in parts of your body where they do not belong, like your heart and blood vessels. This can lead to heart disease. Minerals: Minerals, such as calcium and phosphorus, are nutrients that you get from food. Your body needs them to work properly and stay healthy. Nutrients: Chemicals that you get from food that are necessary to live and grow. They are used to build and repair tissues, regulate body processes, and for energy. Vitamins, minerals, and protein are nutrients. Osteoporosis: A disorder in which the bones weaken and become brittle, fracture easily, and heal slowly. It is very common in older women. Parathyroid hormone (PTH): A hormone that affects the balance of calcium and phosphorus levels in your blood. Also called PTH. Phosphate binders: Medicines that keep phosphorus in the foods you eat from getting into your blood. 22 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE.

There is no single eating plan that is right for everyone with kidney disease. The best foods for you depend on how well your kidneys works and other factors, like if you have diabetes. Your doctor can refer you to a kidney dietitian (a dietitian who specializes in kidney disease) who can teach you how to choose foods that are right for you. How can a kidney dietitian help? A kidney dietitian can: help you choose foods that will give you the right nutrients in the right amounts explain why diet changes are important answer your questions KIDNEY. ORG 5 Tip Help from a dietitian is very important for people with kidney disease. You may be eligible for reimbursement for medical nutrition therapy with a dietitian under Medicare or your health insurance plan. Learn more at medicare. gov 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Nutrition basics A healthy eating plan gives you the right amount of: protein calories vitamins minerals HEALTHY DIET PLANS FOR PEOPLE WITH KIDNEY DISEASE: Mediterranean diet (CKD stages 15 not on dialysis) Diets high in fruits and vegetables (CKD stages 14) Other options include DASH and plant-based diets Note: These diets are high in potassium. Ask your doctor or kidney dietitian which dietary pattern is best for you. Tip If you need help finding a kidney dietitian who specializes in kidney disease, you can ask your doctor for a referral or contact the National Kidney Foundation at kidney. org/ckdrd or the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics at 800. 877. 1600 or eatright. org KIDNEY. ORG 7 Why do I need protein? Protein is an important nutrient. Your body needs protein to help build muscle, repair tissue, and fight infection. But if you have kidney disease, you may need to closely watch the amount of protein you eat to prevent protein wastes from building up in your blood. This can help your kidneys work longer. Your doctor will tell you if you need to limit how much protein you eat each day. Decisions are based on your stage of kidney disease, level of nutrition, muscle mass, and other things. Let your kidney doctor and kidney dietitian help you. Protein comes from the following: lentils and dried beans poultry (chicken and turkey unsalted nuts meats (beef, veal, fish and other seafood lamb, pork) eggs This food list is not complete. Your kidney dietitian can help you learn how to maintain good nutrition and eat the right amount of protein to help your kidneys and prevent muscle breakdown. 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Important Reminder There are two kinds of protein, animal protein and plant protein. Animal protein is found in products like meat, poultry, fish, and eggs. Plant protein is found in dried beans, lentils, and nuts. A wellbalanced diet for kidney patients may include either kind of protein every day. KIDNEY. ORG 9 How many calories do I need? Every person is different. Calories are like fuelthey provide your body with the energy you need to live.

A wellbalanced diet for kidney patients may include either kind of protein every day. KIDNEY. ORG 9 How many calories do I need? Every person is different. Calories are like fuelthey provide your body with the energy you need to live. They are important because they: help you stay at a healthy body weight give you energy to do your daily tasks and remain active help your body use the protein in food to build muscles and tissues 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION It is important to plan meals that give you enough calories each day. Otherwise, your body may not have energy to stay healthy. Your kidney dietitian can help you do this. Some people may be told to eat more calories. They may need to eat extra sweets like sugar, jam, jelly, hard candy, honey, and syrup. Other good sources of calories come from fats such as unsalted nuts and oils like canola or olive oil. How do I get enough vitamins and minerals? Most people get enough vitamins and minerals to stay healthy by eating a wide variety of foods each day. However, if you have kidney disease, you may need to limit some foods that would normally give you these important vitamins and minerals. If so, you may need to take special vitamins or minerals instead. Your doctor and kidney dietitian will tell you what choices are good for you. Other Tips Take only the vitamins and minerals your doctor recommends, because some vitamins and minerals may be harmful to people with kidney disease. Check with your doctor before taking any vitamins, herbal supplements, nutrition supplements, or medicines you can buy without a doctors prescription. Some may be harmful to people with kidney disease. KIDNEY. ORG 11 How will I know if I am getting enough calories and nutrients? Your doctor will test your blood and urine. These tests will help show whether or not you are getting enough nutrients. Your kidney dietitian may also ask you about the foods you eat. You may also be asked to keep track of everything you eat or drink, also known as a food diary. To learn more about the tests used to check your nutrition, visit kidney. org or call NKF Cares at 1. 855. NKF. CARES (855. 653. 2273). 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION What if I dont want to eat or dont like my food choices? When you have kidney disease, it may be difficult to get enough nutrients from food, especially if you are on a limited-protein diet. Many people with kidney disease also find it hard to eat enough calories each day. Many supplements are available, and some are made just for people with kidney disease or diabetes. Check with your doctor or kidney dietitian before taking any supplements. Important Tip If you have diabetes and CKD, ask your kidney dietitian how many calories you should have and what you should do to keep your blood sugar under control.

Check with your doctor or kidney dietitian before taking any supplements. Important Tip If you have diabetes and CKD, ask your kidney dietitian how many calories you should have and what you should do to keep your blood sugar under control. Adding sweet, high-calorie foods to your meals may not be a good choice for you. Will I need nutritional supplements? Remember, not all people with kidney disease have the same dietary needs. Your doctor and kidney dietitian will tell you if you need to take nutritional supplements. Use only the supplements recommended by your doctor or kidney dietitian. KIDNEY. ORG 13 Other Nutrients Will I need to control any other nutrients? You may need to balance fluids and other important nutrients. They are: sodium phosphorus calcium potassium 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION SODIUM Sodium is a mineral found in most foods. It is also found in table salt. Sodium affects blood pressure and water balance in your body. Healthy kidneys can control sodium. But, if your kidneys do not work well, sodium and fluid build up in your body. This can cause high blood pressure and other problems, like swelling of your ankles, fingers, or eyes. Your doctor or kidney dietitian will tell you if you need to limit sodium. You can limit sodium by limiting table salt and foods such as: seasonings like soy sauce, sea salt, teriyaki sauce, garlic salt, onion salt, or seasoned salt most canned foods and frozen dinners (unless they say low sodium check the label) processed meats like ham, bacon, hot dogs, sausage, and deli meats salted snack foods, like chips and crackers canned or dehydrated soups (like packaged noodle soup) most restaurant foods, takeout foods, and fast foods This food list is not complete. Your kidney dietitian can teach you how to choose lower sodium foods. Learning how to read food labels can help you find foods with less sodium. KIDNEY. ORG 15 Tips Learn to read food labels so you know what you are eating. Reading labels can help you shop for foods with lower sodium and to check for added nutrients that may be bad for you. Do NOT use potassium chloride salt substitutes unless approved by your doctor. Try fresh or dried herbs and spices instead of table salt to bring out the flavor of foods. Also, try adding a dash of hot pepper sauce or a squeeze of lemon juice for flavor. 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION PHOSPHORUS Phosphorus is a mineral found in many foods. People with kidney disease may need to closely watch how much phosphorus is in their food. As kidney disease gets worse, the kidneys are not able to remove extra phosphorus.

A simple blood test can check your potassium level. Too much or too little potassium in the blood can be dangerous. Some people with kidney disease need more potassium; others need less. How much you need depends on how well your kidneys are working. It also depends on whether or not you are taking any medicine that changes the level of potassium in your blood. 20 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Tips Choose low potassium fruits and vegetables such as tangerines, grapes, cherries, berries, apples, canned fruit, lettuce, cucumber, green beans, cabbage, celery, corn, peas, and cauliflower. Use long moist cooking methods that lower the potassium amount in food. Example: peel, cut, and double boil potatoes to lower potassium by half. KIDNEY. ORG 21 FLUID Most people in the early stages of with kidney disease do not need to limit the amount of fluids they drink. If you do not know your stage of kidney disease, ask your doctor. If your kidney disease gets worse, your doctor will let you know if you need to limit fluids and how much fluid is okay for you each day. To avoid dehydration, let your doctor and kidney dietitian help plan your fluid intake. To learn more about CKD contact the National Kidney Foundation 855. NKF. CARES (855. 653. 2273). 22 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION What if I have diabetes? You may need to make a few changes in your diet if you have diabetes and kidney disease. If your doctor says that you should eat less protein, your diet may need to include more carbohydrates or high-quality fats to give you enough calories. Work with your kidney dietitian to make a meal plan that is right for you. Ask your doctor how often to test your blood sugar levels. Try to keep your levels under control. Your dosage of insulin or other medicines may need to change if your kidney disease gets worse. Contact your doctor if your blood sugar levels are too high or too low. What about plant-based or meatless diets? Plant-based or meatless diets may have a positive effect on health. Eating a variety of plant foods and getting enough calories is important. Without enough calories, your body will break down the protein you eat to create energy instead. If protein is broken down, more waste products have to be removed by your kidneys. Ask about ways to check that the amount of protein you are eating is right for you. Talk with your kidney dietitian about the best sources of plant protein that have the right amounts of potassium and phosphorus to best meet your dietary needs. Your doctor or kidney dietitian can check your blood to make sure you are getting the right amount of protein and calories. KIDNEY. ORG 23 How is nutritional health is checked? You will be checked regularly by your doctor and dietitian to make sure you are getting the right nutrients that you need.

KIDNEY. ORG 23 How is nutritional health is checked? You will be checked regularly by your doctor and dietitian to make sure you are getting the right nutrients that you need. Some tests are: PHYSICAL NUTRITION EXAM Your dietitian may give you an exam to check your body for signs of nutrition problems. This exam is called a Subjective Global Assessment (SGA). Your dietitian asks you about the foods you eat and looks at the fat and muscle levels in your body. The dietitian notes: changes in your weight changes in the tissues around your face, arms, hands, shoulders, and legs your food intake your activity and energy levels problems that might interfere with eating DIETARY INTERVIEWS AND FOOD DIARIES Your dietitian will ask about what you eat. You may also be asked to keep a food diary of everything you eat and drink each day. Your dietitian wants to see if you are getting the right amount of protein, calories, vitamins, and minerals. 24 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Questions for your healthcare professional If you have questions or are unsure about anything, write down your questions before you go to your doctor or kidney dietitian because it is easy to forget what you wanted to talk about. Make sure you ask what each test result means and what your options are. You need to understand the treatment plan that your doctor or dietitian thinks is good for you. This is your health, so never feel uncomfortable about asking anything. KIDNEY.

It is been written for adults who are receiving hemodialysis treatments. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Getting the right amount of calories Getting the right amount of calories is important to your overall health and helps to give you energy to do the activities you enjoy. Calories come from all the foods you eat, and are important because they: give your body energy help you stay at a healthy body weight help your body use protein for building muscles and tissues The registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) at your dialysis center will help you plan your meals to get the right amount of calories each day. The amount of calories recommended for you will depend on your individual needs. Eating the right amount of calories each day will keep you from losing weight. If you are losing weight, your dietitian may ask you to add extra sweets like sugar, jelly, jam, hard candy, honey, or syrup. Other good sources of calories are fats like soft (tub) margarine, and oils like canola or olive oil. If you have diabetes, speak to your dietitian about how to safely add calories to your diet. KIDNEY. ORG 5 Working with your dietitian You may feel a bit confused by all the new information about your kidney disease and its treatment. You probably have many questions about your diet. Help is available to you. The staff at your dialysis center includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) with special training in diets for people with kidney disease. This dietitian can answer your questions about your diet and help you plan your meals to get the right foods in the right amounts. Steps to take Speak to the dietitian at your dialysis center. Ask your dietitian to help you plan meals with the right amount of calories. Keep a diary of what you eat each day. Show this to your dietitian on a regular basis.

Learn to flavor your foods with herbs and spices instead of table salt. Do NOT use salt substitutes containing potassium unless approved by your healthcare professional. TIP To cut down on sodium, try using fresh or dried herbs and spices instead of salt to enhance the flavor of your foods. Also, try adding a dash of hot pepper sauce or a squeeze of lemon for flavor. Your healthcare professional or dietitian will help you determine the right amount of fluid to drink each day. A sudden increase in weight, along with swelling, shortness of breath, or a rise in your blood pressure may be signs that you are drinking too many fluids. Tell your dialysis care team if you are having any of 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION these problems. Check your weight at the beginning of each treatment. Ask your dietitian for creative ways to cut down on the amount of fluid you are drinking. WHAT IS FLUID? Fluid is any food or beverage that is liquid at room temperature. Some examples are: ice beverages like coffee, tea, sodas, juices, and water frozen desserts such as ice cream, sherbet, or popsicles gelatin gravy and soups KIDNEY. ORG 11 Phosphorus and calcium Phosphorus is a mineral found in all foods. Large amounts of phosphorus are found in: dairy products such as milk, cheese, yogurt, ice cream, and pudding nuts and peanut butter dried beans and peas such as kidney beans, split peas, and lentils beverages such as cocoa, beer and dark cola drinks. convenience and processed foods with phosphorus-containing food additives such as chicken nuggets and hot dogs, refrigerated bakery products, and some beverages. Eating foods high in phosphorus will raise the amount of phosphorus in your blood. However, phosphorus from plant foods is less absorbed than phosphorus from animal foods or phosphate additives. Dialysis cannot remove all of this phosphorus in your blood. When phosphorus builds up in your blood, calcium is pulled from the bones. Over time, your bones will become weak and break easily. A high level of 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION phosphorus in your blood may also cause calcium phosphorus crystals to build up in your joints, muscles, skin, blood vessels, and heart. These deposits may cause serious problems such as bone pain, damage to the heart and other organs, poor blood circulation, and skin ulcers. To keep blood phosphorus at safe levels, you will need to limit phosphorus-rich foods, and you may need to take a type of medicine called a phosphate binder. These binders are taken with your meals and snacks. TIP Using fresh foods instead of processed or convenience foods is a good way to lower the amount of phosphorus in your diet. Read nutrition labels to look for the word phosphorus or a shortened phos in the ingredients of processed foods. Calcium is a mineral that is important for building strong bones. However, foods that are good sources of calcium are also high in phosphorus.

Read nutrition labels to look for the word phosphorus or a shortened phos in the ingredients of processed foods. Calcium is a mineral that is important for building strong bones. However, foods that are good sources of calcium are also high in phosphorus. The best ways to prevent loss of calcium from your bones are to follow a diet that limits high-phosphorus foods and to take phosphate binders. Your healthcare professional may also prescribe a special form of vitamin D to help keep calcium and phosphoru s levels in balance and to prevent bone disease. Do not take over-the-counter vitamin D unless recommended by your kidney healthcare professional. KIDNEY. ORG 13 Potassium Potassium is another important mineral found in food. Potassium helps your muscles and heart work properly. Too much or too little potassium in the blood can be dangerous. With hemodialysis, you will probably need to limit your intake of high-potassium foods. The level of potassium in your blood will be checked every month, and your dietitian will help you plan a diet that will give you the right amount of potassium. Large amounts of potassium are found in: certain fruits and vegetables (like bananas, melons, oranges, potatoes, tomatoes, and some juices) milk and yogurt dried beans and peas most salt substitutes protein-rich foods, such as meat, poultry, pork and fish. 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Vitamins and minerals Eating a wide variety of foods gives your body the vitamins and minerals it needs each day. In addition to a good diet, your healthcare professional may order special vitamin and mineral supplements. Kidney disease and dialysis change the amounts of vitamins and minerals your body needs. Also, your special diet may limit some food groups that would normally provide important vitamins and minerals. Take only those supplements ordered by your kidney healthcare professional, since certain vitamins and minerals can be harmful if you are on dialysis. Also, check with your healthcare professional before using any herbal remedies, as some of these may be harmful for people with kidney disease. KIDNEY. ORG 15 Handling special diet needs Diabetes and your special diet You may need to make only a few changes in your diabetic diet to fit your needs on hemodialysis. You may need to drink less milk and eat less potassiumrich fruits and vegetables. Your dietitian will help develop a meal plan especially for you. Plant-based diets Plant-based diets may have a positive effect on health. Eating a variety of plant foods and getting enough calories is important. Eating enough calories is an important way to use protein for important jobs like building muscle, healing wounds and fighting infections. Talk with your dietitian about the best sources of plant protein that have the right amounts of potassium and phosphorus to meet your special needs. 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How your nutritional health is checked There are several different ways for your healthcare professional and dietitian to determine if you are eating the right amount of calories or protein.

16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How your nutritional health is checked There are several different ways for your healthcare professional and dietitian to determine if you are eating the right amount of calories or protein. The following sections explain these tests and methods. If your results are not what they should be, ask how to improve them. Dietary interviews and food diaries Your dietitian will speak to you at times about your diet. The dietitian may also ask you to keep a record of what you eat each day. If you are not eating the right amount of protein, calories, and other nutrients, your dietitian will give you ideas about food choices that will help to improve your diet. KIDNEY. ORG 17 Physical nutrition exam Your dietitian may use a method called Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) to check your body for signs of nutrition problems. This involves asking you questions about your food intake and looking at the stored fat and muscle in your body. The dietitian will consider: changes in your weight changes in the tissues around your face, arms, hands, shoulders, and legs your food intake your activity and energy levels problems that might interfere with eating. Amount of dialysis you receive Every month, tests will be used to determine if you are getting the right amount of dialysis to keep you in good health. Blood is tested at the beginning and the end of one of your dialysis treatments. You may also be asked for a urine sample. This information will provide a way to measure dialysis, called Kt/V (pronounced kay tee over vee) and urea reduction ratio (URR). A low Kt/V (or a low URR) may mean that you are not getting enough dialysis. Low amounts of dialysis can keep you from feeling, sleeping or eating well. To keep your Kt/V and URR levels as high as possible, it is very important to come to all of your treatment sessions and stay for the full treatment time as ordered by your healthcare professional. 18 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Steps to take Ask your healthcare professional and dietitian which tests will be used to check your nutritional health. Ask for a copy of the Dialysis Report Card and track your results. If your numbers are not what they should be, ask your healthcare professional and dietitian how you can improve them. KIDNEY. ORG 19 Where can you get more information? If you have questions, speak with your healthcare team. They know you and can answer questions about you.

ORG 3 Introduction If you have recently had an organ transplant, you are probably wondering if your diet will be different from the one you followed before your transplant. This brochure describes diet changes you may need to make in order to feel your best. You can get additional help in planning your diet from your doctor and a registered dietitian nutritionist. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Do I need to be on a special diet? Yes. After an organ transplant, your diet still plays a big role. If you were on dialysis and had a kidney transplant, you may find that this diet is easier to follow than the one you were on for your dialysis. KIDNEY. ORG 5 What about my cholesterol and triglyceride levels? Fat (cholesterol or triglyceride) levels in your blood may be high. High levels of cholesterol and triglyceride can cause heart disease. The following steps can lower the fat and cholesterol in your blood: Lose weight if you are over a desirable weight level. Limit alcoholic beverages. Limit egg yolks to three or four a week. Limit all types of fats and oils. Use lean meats, poultry or fish. Use nonfat dairy products. Use salad dressing sparingly, or use fat-free salad dressing. Avoid frying foods. Avoid shortening, butter or stick margarine. Use only small amounts of oils, tub margarine or regular mayonnaise. Avoid those that describe the first ingredient as hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated. Replace high-fat desserts like ice cream, pie, cake or cookies with fruit or other nonfat desserts. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Tip A healthy diet plan such as the Mediterranean diet may help control your blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Some foods high in potassium are: oranges bananas avocados tomato sauce potatoes (white or sweet) milk and yogurt salt substitutes KIDNEY. ORG 11 Are calcium and phosphorus a problem? You may need to pay close attention to your calcium and phosphorus levels. If you have been ill for a period of time, your body probably lacks the balance of calcium and phosphorus needed for healthy bones, especially if you had kidney disease. Whether you have received a heart, liver, lung or kidney transplant, you are at risk for bone loss. In the months after your transplant, your doctor will check for possible bone loss and talk to you about the best way to keep your bones as healthy as possible. In the meantime, every adult needs about two servings a day from the dairy group (milk, cheese and yogurt). Unless your doctor or dietitian has told you not to use these foods, try to include them in your meals. Your doctor may decide you need more calcium and phosphorus than this allows and may have you take a supplement. Do not start any supplements on your own, however, as this could affect your transplant. 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Will any of my medicines affect my diet? Yes. Your diet will be affected by the use of necessary medicines given to prevent rejection of your transplant. List your transplant medicines here and talk to your doctor and dietitian about how they may affect your diet. Anti-rejection medicines may change the way your body works in the following ways: STEROIDS (PREDNISONE) The most common effects of taking steroids are increases in your: appetite, causing unwanted weight gain level of blood fats like cholesterol or triglyceride blood sugar levels sodium (salt) and fluid retention breakdown of muscle and bone These effects are greater when steroid dosages are high. KIDNEY. ORG 13 What are common side effects? The most common possible effects of other important transplant medicines are increases in your: level of blood fats like cholesterol or triglyceride blood sugar levels blood pressure Changes in potassium, magnesium and phosphorus levels are also common. These levels may return to normal as the doctor carefully lowers the amount of medicine you need to prevent rejection of your transplant. 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Will I gain weight? Many people have a better appetite after they get a transplant, and they gain unwanted weight. Weigh yourself often. Avoid high-calorie foods, such as fatty foods, sweets, pastries and other foods rich in fat or sugar. You can help control your calories by eating: raw vegetables and fruits lean meat, skinned poultry and fish nonfat dairy products sugar-free beverages or water Controlling your weight will help to keep you from developing problems, such as heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. If you gain unwanted weight, you will need to increase your physical activity and follow a low-calorie diet. Ask your doctor to refer you to a registered dietitian nutritionist to plan low-calorie meals and snacks.

If you gain unwanted weight, you will need to increase your physical activity and follow a low-calorie diet. Ask your doctor to refer you to a registered dietitian nutritionist to plan low-calorie meals and snacks. It is very important that you establish an exercise and activity plan. In addition to controlling your weight, regular physical activity helps to: strengthen your heart muscle give you better form and appearance improve your endurance keep your bones healthy Make sure you set up an exercise program with your doctors advice and get started with it as soon as you are permitted. KIDNEY. ORG 15 What if I have diabetes? After a transplant, your new diet may be higher in protein and lower in simple carbohydrates due to the effects of steroids and other medicines. Work with your doctor and a registered dietitian nutritionist to keep your diet and blood sugar in good control. Is there anything else I should know? Yes. You may be surprised or alarmed to be on a special diet for a short while after your transplant. For example, a kidney transplant may sometimes be slow in getting started, so the doctor will have you follow a kidney diet for a while. This usually is needed for only a short time. Or, you may be asked to drink a lot of water (something you were told to stay away from in the past). Your doctor and dietitian will guide you through these changes if they happen. Just remember, if your doctor tells you to change what you eat or drink, it is very important for your health and the health of your transplant that you do so. 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Where can I get more information?

. . . . . . . . . . . . . 11 WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 3 Many people take pain medicines to help them treat pain resulting from illness or injury. They are the most often used medicine in the United States. However, pain medicines can have different effects on the kidneys, depending on the type of medicine, how it is used, and how well your kidneys are working. This educational brochure will help answer some questions you might have about pain medicines and your kidneys. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION What are analgesics? Pain medicines are also called analgesics. They are used to help relieve pain, but can also sometimes be used to help lower fever or inflammation (redness and swelling from an injury or illness), depending on the type of pain medicine. These benefits are important, especially for those who need them, including people with arthritis, headaches, muscle aches, colds, toothaches, menstrual cramps, and sinus infection. Examples of pain medicines that are available over-thecounter (OTC) include aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium. OTC means they are available without a prescription, but if you have kidney disease, you should still speak to your healthcare provider about any medicines before you take them. Some of these medicines also come in higher strength, or dose, with a prescription. OTC pain medicines are usually available as a pill, either on its own or combined with other medicines, such as certain cold and cough medicines. Some pain medicines are also available in a topical form, meaning they are applied on the skin as a cream, gel, or patch. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 5 Are pain medicines safe? Pain medicines can help relieve pain and are generally safe when taken as directed. However, as with any medicine, they can have side effects and you should use them as directed on their labels. If you do not use pain medicines as directed, they may cause problems with your stomach, liver, or kidneys, depending on the type, dose, and duration of pain medicine used. The harm to your kidneys can be sudden, and result in acute kidney injury (AKI). In some cases, if you stop the pain medicine you may reverse short-term harm to your kidneys, meaning kidney function may recover. Continued overuse or misuse of certain pain medicines can also lead to a slow loss of kidney function over time, or chronic kidney disease (CKD). What are NSAIDs? The term NSAID stands for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. NSAIDs are a group of pain relievers. Some NSAIDs are available OTC, including ibuprofen (for example, Advil, Motrin), naproxen sodium (for example, Aleve), and aspirin (for example, Bayer). Generic versions (no brand name) of these brands are also available. People use NSAIDs to reduce fever and relieve pain. Prescription NSAIDs can be used to reduce inflammation caused by many medical problems or injuries. Are NSAIDs safe to take? OTC NSAIDs are generally safe for occasional use when taken as directed.

. . . . . . . . . . . 26 KIDNEY. ORG 3 What is peritoneal dialysis? Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a treatment for people who have kidney failure. Healthy kidneys clean wastes from blood and remove extra fluid from the body. But when your kidneys are not working well, wastes and extra fluid can build up in your blood and make you sick. This can cause: nausea trouble sleeping poor appetite loss of energy hiccups dry, itchy skin weight loss 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION irregular menstrual periods muscle cramping, especially at night swelling anemia (low red blood cell count) trouble breathing Why do I need PD? You need treatment because your kidneys no longer clean enough wastes from your blood or remove extra fluid from your body. Even though people with kidney failure may still have some kidney function, its not enough, and without treatment, you will die. Are there other treatments for kidney failure besides PD? Yes, there are two other treatments for kidney failure. They are: HEMODIALYSIS In hemodialysis, your blood flows through a machine that has a filter which cleans the blood. This machine is called a dialyzer or artificial kidney. Hemodialysis is usually done three times a week, several hours each session. It can be done at a dialysis center or at home. Two needles are inserted into your vein during each dialysis treatment to draw your blood into the dialyzer. KIDNEY TRANSPLANT In transplantation, a healthy kidney is put inside your body to do the work of your own kidneys. KIDNEY. ORG 5 Are there different types of PD? Yes. The major ones are: Continuous Ambulatory PD (CAPD). With CAPD, you do the exchanges yourself three to four times a day. Automated PD (APD). With APD, a machine called a cycler does the exchanges automatically while you sleep. You may also need to do one exchange during the day if your kidney function decreases further. CAPD and APD are both done during the night and day. Your treatment times are decided by your and your doctor and are included in the physicians orders. Patients are usually trained on CAPD first before learning how to use the cycler for APD and both types can be done at home, work, or while travelling. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How does PD work? A soft tube, called a catheter, is placed in your belly. This is done by minor surgery. This catheter makes it possible for you to easily connect to a special tubing which allows two to three quarts of a cleansing fluid to flow into your belly. The cleansing fluid is called dialysate. It takes about 10 minutes for the dialysate to fill your belly. What happens next is an amazing process. The lining of your belly (called the peritoneum) acts as a natural filter. It lets the wastes and extra fluid in your blood pass through it into the cleansing fluid.

It takes about 10 minutes for the dialysate to fill your belly. What happens next is an amazing process. The lining of your belly (called the peritoneum) acts as a natural filter. It lets the wastes and extra fluid in your blood pass through it into the cleansing fluid. At the same time, the lining of your belly holds back the important things your body needs, like red blood cells and nutrients. KIDNEY. ORG 7 To do its job, the dialysate must stay in your belly for a few hours or more, depending on your body size and how much waste has to be removed. This time is called your dwell time. With CAPD, when the filling is done, the catheter is capped so that it doesnt leak. After your dwell time, you drain the cleansing fluid from your body into an empty bag. You discard the bag. You then repeat the in-and-out process a number of times during the day, using fresh dialysate. The process of exchanging bags of dialysate is called an exchange. With APD, a cycler machine does exchanges for you while you sleep. How will I learn how to do PD? The training staff at your dialysis center will teach you everything you need to know, including how to do exchanges, order supplies, clean your catheter, and guard against infection. Once you and the staff are comfortable with your ability to do PD alone, you can start doing your own treatments at home. 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How will I know how much dialysis I need? The amount of dialysis needed is different for everyone. It is based on many factors, including your weight, how much kidney function you still have, your overall health, and the results of your lab tests. Your doctor will give you a dialysis prescription that is designed just for you. Your prescription will tell you: how many exchanges you need to make each day how long the dialysis fluid needs to stay in your belly (your dwell time) what type and amount of dialysis fluid you need to use for each exchange What will my dialysis prescription be based on? Your doctor will base your prescription on: YOUR SIZE Large, muscular people may need more frequent exchanges or larger bags, which means that more dialysis fluid goes into your belly. YOUR REMAINING KIDNEY FUNCTION How much dialysis you need is based on how much kidney function you have left. Your doctor or dialysis care team should measure your remaining kidney function. This is measured by a blood test and 24-hour urine collection. It should be checked within the first month after starting dialysis and every four months thereafter, if your urine output is stable. KIDNEY. ORG 9 However, if your urine output is decreasing (you are not peeing as much or as often), your remaining kidney function should be checked every two months. You should tell your doctor whenever you notice your daily urine output has become less.

KIDNEY. ORG 9 However, if your urine output is decreasing (you are not peeing as much or as often), your remaining kidney function should be checked every two months. You should tell your doctor whenever you notice your daily urine output has become less. YOUR NUTRITIONAL HEALTH How well you feel on dialysis may be affected by how well you eat. Your dietitian will help you plan a diet that gives you the right amount of nutrients. YOUR GENERAL HEALTH If you are getting enough treatment, you should feel well, have a good appetite, and have enough energy to do many of the activities you enjoy. You should tell your doctor if you: are often nauseous have a poor appetite cannot taste are feeling too tired for your daily activities This may mean you have other health problems or that you are not getting enough dialysis. If so, your doctor may need to change your dialysis prescription or other medical care that you are receiving. 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION YOUR PERITONEAL EQUILIBRATION TEST (PET) This test is done within 4 to 8 weeks after starting PD. It measures how well your peritoneal membrane is working and helps your doctor decide how: Many exchanges you need each day Long the dialysis fluid should stay in your belly Much and the type of dialysis fluid you need KIDNEY. ORG 11 Tips Getting the best results for your dialysis treatment depends on how well you follow your prescription. Make sure to do the following: Use all your prescribed exchanges Follow the prescribed amount of time (dwell time) you keep the dialysis fluid in your belly Use the full amount of dialysis fluid prescribed for you Prevent infections by doing your exchanges exactly as you were taught Take all your medications exactly as ordered by your doctor Follow your diet and fluid allowances (too much fluid in your body can cause swelling, shortness of breath, and increased blood pressure) Report any problems to your doctor or dialysis care team Do not be afraid to tell your dialysis care team exactly how you do your exchanges (this is the best way to make sure that you are doing them correctly) 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Will my dialysis care team monitor my treatments? Yes. Your dialysis care team will measure your treatments regularly with lab tests. This tells them if your treatment is removing enough wastes from your blood. The test that is used to check your delivered dose of dialysis is called Kt/Vurea (pronounced kaytee over vee-yur-ee-a). Your total Kt/Vurea from the dialysis and your remaining kidney function should never be less than 1. 7 per week. KIDNEY. ORG 13 How often should my treatments be measured? Your delivered dose of dialysis should be measured every four months.

Your delivered dose of dialysis should be measured every four months. This measurement should be done more often when your: PD prescription is changed Dialysis care team feels it is needed Kidney function levels have gone down To measure your delivered dose of dialysis, your dialysis care team may ask you to bring to the dialysis center all the dialysis bags you used over a 24-hour period, or just a sample from each of the used bags. You may also be asked for a 24-hour urine collection. Both the urine and the dialysate collections are important ways to measure your total dose of dialysis. What if my overall health happens to get worse? Tell your doctor. Your dialysis care team will do some tests to find out why. They may check to see if youre: Doing all your exchanges as prescribed Having other health problems not related to kidney failure and dialysis They will also check to see is your peritoneal membrane is working well. Sometimes, the membrane may not work as well if you have had serious infections, or if you have been on PD for several years. 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION When this occurs, your doctor may need to change your dialysis prescription. If your remaining kidney function has decreased too much, your doctor may want you to: Increase the number of bags you use each day Use a cycler Switch to hemodialysis Will I need to follow a special diet? Yes. Getting the right nutrients and balancing fluids is as important to your health as getting the right amount of dialysis. The registered dietitian at your dialysis center will help you plan your diet to make sure you get the right amount of protein, calories, and other important nutrients. You may also need to: Limit how much sodium (salt) you eat Take nutritional supplements Tip Because your dialysis fluid contains sugar, you may have a tendency to gain weight. Your dietitian can help you plan your diet to get the right amount of calories and keep up the right weight for you. If you have diabetes, your dosage of insulin or other medications may need to change. KIDNEY. ORG 15 What is peritonitis? One thing you have to be very careful about in PD is peritonitis, an infection of the peritoneum (the lining of your belly). Peritonitis happens when germs get into the peritoneal cavity through the catheter. It is treatable with antibiotics, but its important to get it treated promptly.

One thing you have to be very careful about in PD is peritonitis, an infection of the peritoneum (the lining of your belly). Peritonitis happens when germs get into the peritoneal cavity through the catheter. It is treatable with antibiotics, but its important to get it treated promptly. When doing an exchange: Make sure the area where you do your exchange is clean Make sure you and anyone else in the room wears a surgical mask Do not allow children or pets into the room Close all doors and windows and turn off any ceiling fans or air conditioners Gather all your supplies before you start your exchange Scrub your hands with soap for at least two minutes before each exchange (your dialysis care team can tell you the right kind of soap to use) Dry your hands with a disposable paper towel 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Do not touch anything unrelated to your treatment, not even your skin or your hair (if you do touch something, scrub your hands with soap for two minutes again before continuing) Avoid coughing or sneezing on your sterile supplies (if you do you must start the process over with new supplies) Make sure you do your exchanges exactly as taught by your training program. Dont try anything different without asking your dialysis care team about it. KIDNEY. ORG 17 What are the signs of peritonitis? The main signs of peritonitis are: a cloudy dialysate bag when you are draining out the used fluid unusual stomach pain, either mild or severe fever or chills If you notice any of these signs, call your doctor or dialysis center right away. Getting prompt treatment for peritonitis is very important. If you do not get prompt treatment, the infection can get worse and you may have to go to the hospital. In addition, the infection may scar your peritoneal membrane, making PD less effective. In severe cases, you may have to change to hemodialysis. Are there any other infections I should watch for? Infections can also occur at the place where the catheter leaves your skin, called your exit site. You should clean this area at least once a day with soap and water. You should also check your exit site and catheter every day. If problems occur, you can often catch them in the early stages. Signs of exit site infection are: Redness, swelling, or bulging around the exit site Tenderness, pain, or pus at the exit site 18 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Tips Taking good care of your catheter is also important to prevent infections and have good results on PD. Here are some tips for routine catheter care: Check your catheter every day for signs of cracking or pulling Do not wear tight clothes and belts around the exit site Wash your hands with soap and water for at least two minutes and dry them with a disposable paper towel before handling your catheter, and before and after an exchange is made.

Tape the catheter down to your skin Keep the catheter away from scissors or other sharp objects. Cleanse the catheter thoroughly with a wash cloth and soap every day Keep a special dressing over the exit site if your dialysis care team tells you Do not allow tugging or pulling of your catheter KIDNEY. ORG 19 What if I have questions or problems? Once you have learned all you need to know, your PD supplies will be delivered directly to your home and you will be ready to start your treatment. You will continue to visit your dialysis center for regular checkups and lab tests. At these visits, your doctor and dialysis care team will check: Your overall health and nutritional health Any symptoms you have that indicate you may not be getting enough dialysis How well you are doing with your exchanges The results of other important tests (see What Your Tests Measure on ) In addition, your center will always be just a phone call away if you have any problems. You will be the primary person responsible for your own care. So be sure to call your doctor or dialysis care team if you notice any problems. See Checking for problems on the following pages. 20 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Checking for problems WEIGHT What to Check: Weigh yourself each day at about the same time. Signs of Possible Problems: A sudden weight gain along with swelling, shortness of breath, and an increase in blood pressure is probably due to too much fluid in your body. A gradual weight gain without swelling, shortness of breath and an increase in blood pressure may be due to an increase in muscle or fat. Loss of weight with dizziness and low blood pressure may signify that there is too little fluid in your body. What to Do: Make sure to follow your diet and fluid allowances. Speak to your doctor and dietitian about your diet, fluid intake, medications, and dialysis prescription. Speak to your dietitian about whether you need to change your intake of calories. BLOOD PRESSURE What to Check: Check your blood pressure and pulse every day. Signs of Possible Problems: An increase in blood pressure and pulse may be due to too much fluid weight gain. What to Do: Follow your sodium (salt) and fluid allowances to avoid too much fluid weight gain. Your doctor may want to change your medications to better control your blood pressure. KIDNEY. ORG 21 DIALYSATE What to Check: Check how your dialysate looks when you drain it out. Signs of Possible Problems: Your dialysate should be clear and yellow in color. Cloudy dialysate is a sign of infection. You should be able to see the printed words on the bag through the solution. If you cant, your dialysate is cloudy. Whitish strands in the dialysate are little clots of protein and can get large enough to block your tubing or PD catheter.

You should be able to see the printed words on the bag through the solution. If you cant, your dialysate is cloudy. Whitish strands in the dialysate are little clots of protein and can get large enough to block your tubing or PD catheter. To prevent this, call your doctor if you notice any whitish strands in your dialysate. Pinkish appearing dialysate means that some blood is leaking into the dialysis fluid. Some women notice this with their monthly period. It may also occur if you have been exercising or lifting something heavy. Do not be concerned about a small amount of bloodif it occurs with a monthly period or after rigorous exercise. However, watch the fluid closely and call your dialysis center if it becomes more pinkish or red. What to Do: Call your dialysis center if you see whitish strands in the dialysate. You may need to inject a blood thinner called heparin into your fresh dialysate to clear the fluid; your nurse will tell you how to do this. 22 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION INFECTION What to Check: Check yourself for signs of infection. Signs of Possible Problems: Unusual stomach pain, fever, or cloudy dialysate could mean you have an infection called peritonitis. Peritonitis can become serious very quickly. What to Do: Call your doctor or dialysis center right away if you see signs of peritonitis (see ). If you have peritonitis, follow your doctors instructions carefully and take all the antibiotic medications ordered for you. KIDNEY. ORG 23 What do tests measure? Kt/Vurea measures your delivered dose of dialysis. It tells whether you are receiving the right amount of dialysis. Your total Kt/Vurea from the dialysate and your remaining kidney function should be no less than 1. 7 per week. Albumin and normalized protein nitrogen appearance (nPNA) are measures of your nutritional health. The test results show if you are getting enough protein and calories from your diet. Average daily weight gain is the amount of fluid weight you gain each day between dialysis treatments. If you do not follow your fluid and salt limits between treatments, you may gain too much fluid weight. Calcium and phosphorus are two minerals that are important for bone health. Having too much or too little amounts of these minerals in your blood can lead to loss of calcium from the bones and increased risk of heart and blood vessel disease. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a calculation that measures how well your kidneys are working. Your eGFR can be calculated using the results of your blood creatinine test, your age, and gender. 24 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Hemoglobin is the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen to your tissues. If your number is too low, you have anemia, and you will need to take one or more medicines to raise the red blood cell level in your body. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is made by four small parathyroid glands, which are located in your neck.

If your number is too low, you have anemia, and you will need to take one or more medicines to raise the red blood cell level in your body. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is made by four small parathyroid glands, which are located in your neck. If these glands make too much PTH, you may lose calcium from your bones. Over time, this can weaken your bones and cause them to break more easily. Pre-dialysis and post-dialysis blood pressure should be taken each time you receive dialysis. Your blood pressure goes down when excess fluid and salt are removed from your blood by your dialysis treatment. Potassium is a mineral that is important for a healthy heart. High or low levels of potassium in your blood may be harmful for your heart. Target weight (or dry weight) is how much you should weigh after dialysis removes excess fluid from your body. Blood pressure should be taken on a daily basis. Your blood pressure decreases when excess fluid and salt are filtered out of your blood by your dialysis treatment. KIDNEY.

CKDu appears to disproportionally affect poor, rural, male farmers in hot climates. Despite more than 20 years of study in Sri Lanka and globally, the problem of CKDu is not well understood. The Government of Sri Lanka accords a very high priority to addressing CKDu. A Presidential Task Force on CKDu was set up in 2014 to provide oversight and coordinate the efforts of various sectors, agencies and ministries towards the prevention and treatment of CKDu. In this context, the World Health Organization (WHO) Country Office for Sri Lanka and the Presidential Task Force jointly convened a three-day international expert consultation to guide future direction for addressing CKDu in Sri Lanka. The consultation aimed to develop consensus on research priorities and cost-effective interventions for prevention and management. The objective was to review the knowledge on CKDu globally and in Sri Lanka, identify gaps, prioritize an interdisciplinary collaborative research agenda and recommend interventions based on the available evidence. The Consultation also aimed to develop consensus on the monitoring and accountability framework for implementation of the recommendations. Participants comprised 54 national and international clinicians, researchers, epidemiologists, toxicologists, agriculture scientists, social scientists, hydrologists and other experts who represented the geographical and etiological dimensions of the disease.

The Consultation also aimed to develop consensus on the monitoring and accountability framework for implementation of the recommendations. Participants comprised 54 national and international clinicians, researchers, epidemiologists, toxicologists, agriculture scientists, social scientists, hydrologists and other experts who represented the geographical and etiological dimensions of the disease. Experts came from Sri Lanka, India, the United Kingdom, Australia, Cuba, El Salvador, Finland, Sweden, Canada and Costa Rica adding a wealth of experience to the Consultation. The International Society of Nephrology, Sri Lanka Society of Nephrology, international and national universities, public and private research institutes, National Science Foundation, Coordinating Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation and WHO were the key organizations represented. 7 A series of background papers commissioned for the Consultation provided the current state of the problem of CKDu and the gaps that needed to be filled. These provided overviews of the disease both in Sri Lanka and globally, the clinical aspects, available evidence on the possible role of various agents in the etiopathogenesis of the disease, and the social impact of CKDu. Strong support to the Consultation was expressed by the Director of the Presidential Task Force on CKDu and Secretaries and other senior officials of key ministries at the opening session, highlighting the commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to solving the problem of CKDu through a multisectoral approach. To set the stage, two presentations were made on the status of CKDu in Sri Lanka and globally. Participants were then divided into four groups according to their areas of expertise, asked to review the available evidence on specified topics, and arrive at a series of recommendations by consensus. On the first day, the groups were tasked with defining future research priorities in four key areas: (i) Clinical aspects: early detection, treatment and care; (ii) Role of agrochemicals; (iii) Role of water/heavy metals; and (iv) Role of heat stress/dehydration and miscellaneous hypotheses. On the second day, the four groups had to identify priority costeffective interventions in the following areas: (i) Prevention; (ii) Early detection, treatment and care; (iii) Integrated surveillance and CKD registry; and (iv) Social interventions, as CKDu has a huge social impact on patients and their families. The outputs of the group work were consolidated into key recommendations by consensus. These recommendations will be incorporated into the forthcoming National Action Plan on CKDu for Sri Lanka. In order to implement the National Action Plan on CKDu, a framework for monitoring, implementation and accountability was proposed based on the Every woman Every child accountability concept of the United Nations that was put in place in 2010 to accelerate the progress towards achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. The existing framework consists of a National Committee on CKDu, which can provide the overall oversight. The Presidential Task Force can be the focal point for the proposed intersectoral coordinating mechanism. In addition, constitution of an Independent Expert Review Group was discussed, which could independently review the ongoing interventions and report to the National Committee.

The Presidential Task Force can be the focal point for the proposed intersectoral coordinating mechanism. In addition, constitution of an Independent Expert Review Group was discussed, which could independently review the ongoing interventions and report to the National Committee. All participants agreed to this three-tier approach. Open discussions in the plenaries led to final consensus recommendations, which were presented on the final day of the meeting to the Director of the Presidential Task Force in the concluding session. The recommendations of the Consultation are based on the consensus of all 54 experts who participated in the meeting. 8 Recommendations Develop a robust surveillance system to understand the burden, geographical distribution and time trends of CKDu in Sri Lanka. The surveillance system should be linked to monitoring of potential toxins in food, water and the environment, and provide a platform for long-term research to understand the role of potential risk factors and document the usefulness of ongoing interventions. Establish a consortium of national/international researchers to conduct long-term interdisciplinary research. CKDu is a complex disease and there is a need for sharing expertise across disciplines and countries to accelerate knowledge dissemination, guide the research agenda and help solve the mystery of u (unknown) in CKDu. WHO will facilitate researchers from global CKDu hotspots to engage in research exchange. Strengthen the implementation of available interventions; namely, early detection and management of CKDu in the early stages and dialysis in the late stages. In addition, prioritize the provision of safe drinking water and food in the affected areas and ensure sustainable agricultural practices based on the current status of knowledge and evidence. An evaluation component should be built into these interventions to understand their impact and modify the interventions if needed. Provide social support at three levels patient, family and community. Build the capacity of existing community-level workers, appoint trained paramedical personnel and social workers in appropriate locations, and expand and strengthen social support services and resources. Develop a sound communication strategy to destigmatize the disease. Livelihood generation in affected areas was also recommended. Strengthen/expand human resources at various levels, such as nephrologists, renal care nurses, social workers at the nephrology units and field level to enhance the coverage of renal care services and provide psychosocial support to patients and families. Develop a framework for monitoring and accountability to ensure timely implementation of the activities. A three-tier system was proposed, consisting of a National Committee on CKDu, an intersectoral coordinating mechanism coordinated by the Presidential Task Force and an Independent Expert Review Group. The framework will have its set of performance indicators based on the National Action Plan. This will enable open and transparent measurement as well as communication. 9 Report of the Consultation Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) of public health importance due to its high burden and high cost of treatment in the advanced stages. CKD in adults is predominantly caused by diabetes and hypertension.

9 Report of the Consultation Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) of public health importance due to its high burden and high cost of treatment in the advanced stages. CKD in adults is predominantly caused by diabetes and hypertension. Autoimmune and systemic conditions also cause CKD, as do inherited conditions. Nephrotoxic drugs, herbal medications, toxins and infections are other causes of CKD in developing countries. The prevalence of CKD ranges from 9% to 11% in developed countries. An increased prevalence of CKD has been observed in select geographical areas in several countries over the past two decades. The countries included El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Egypt, Sri Lanka and India. As the etiology was not clear, the term chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) has been used in the literature since the early 2000s. In Sri Lanka and Mesoamerica, CKDu is a serious public health problem that appears to disproportionally affect poor, rural, male farmers in hot climates. Despite more than 20 years of research in Sri Lanka and globally, the problem of CKDu is not well understood. The Government of Sri Lanka accords a very high priority to addressing CKDu. A Presidential Task Force on CKDu was set up in 2014 to provide oversight and coordinate the efforts of various sectors, agencies and ministries towards the prevention and treatment of CKDu. In this context, the World Health Organization (WHO) Country Office for Sri Lanka and Presidential Task Force jointly convened a three-day international consultation to guide future direction for addressing CKDu in Sri Lanka. 11 Objectives The Consultation aimed to develop consensus on research priorities and priority interventions for the prevention and management of CKDu. The objective was to review the knowledge on CKDu globally and in Sri Lanka, identify gaps, prioritize an interdisciplinary collaborative research agenda and recommend interventions based on the available evidence. The Consultation also aimed to develop consensus on a monitoring accountability framework for implementation of the recommendations. Methods Nine background papers were commissioned during the preparatory phase of the Consultation. These papers covered areas such as a global overview of CKDu, overview of CKDu in Sri Lanka, and various other topics relevant to the causes of and interventions for CKDu. These papers were circulated to all experts prior to the meeting and provided background information to facilitate discussions during the meeting. Broad themes of the Consultation were research priorities and priority interventions for CKDu for the first two days. The experts were divided in four groups on Days 1 and 2. Each group was led by two co-chairs one international and one national expert. A note with detailed objectives, key areas of discussion and expected outcomes was given to each of the groups to facilitate the discussion. The Chair summarized the information from the relevant background paper to set the stage for group discussion. The group reviewed the available information, identified gaps and agreed on a set of recommendations.

The Chair summarized the information from the relevant background paper to set the stage for group discussion. The group reviewed the available information, identified gaps and agreed on a set of recommendations. Following a presentation on Principles of testing hypotheses in epidemiological research on the first day, each of the groups was tasked with defining future research priorities in four key areas: (i) Clinical aspects: early detection, treatment and care; (ii) Role of agrochemicals; (iii) Role of water/heavy metals; and (iv) Role of heat stress/dehydration and miscellaneous hypotheses. On the second day, the four groups had to identify priority costeffective interventions in the following areas: (i) Prevention; (ii) Early detection, treatment and care; (iii) Integrated surveillance and CKD registry; and (iv) Social interventions, as CKDu has a huge social impact on patients and their families. The framework for monitoring, implementation and accountability was discussed on the last day of the meeting. At the end of each of the three sessions research priorities, priority interventions and monitoring/ accountability each group presented the outcome of their deliberations to all the experts. An open discussion was held after each presentation, and comments and suggestions were given by the audience. These were incorporated in the final recommendations. All the experts submitted WHO Declaration of Interest forms. 12 Day 01 Opening session The Director of the Presidential Task Force on CKDu, Mr Asela Iddawela, welcomed the participants and gave the background of the Presidential Task Force, which was set up in 2014 to limit the spread of CKDu. Guided directly by the President, its task is to provide oversight and coordinate all activities related to the control of CKDu in Sri Lanka. He hoped that the deliberations from the three-day meeting would help in formulating the National Action Plan and a monitoring framework for its implementation. He wished the participants success. The presence of Secretaries and other senior officials of the Ministries of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine; Science, Technology and Research; City Planning and Water Supply; Social Empowerment and Welfare; and the Chairperson of the University Grants Commission highlighted the commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to combating the problem of CKDu. Each of them discussed the initiatives and interventions being undertaken by their respective ministries and collaboratively. The WHO Representative to Sri Lanka described the objectives of the meeting and the expected outcomes. He explained why this forum, with its diverse range of experts and expertise, was well suited to look for solutions to the problem of CKDu. He urged participants to work as a team, as solutions are easier to find when people share expertise and resources. 13 Setting the scene An overview of the status of CKDu in Sri Lanka apprised participants of the scale of the problem and what was being done to alleviate it.

The presentation was followed by questions pertaining to the sociodemographic characteristics of the patients and role of various risk factors and their combinations. 14 Group work: Defining future research priorities Group 1: Clinical aspects: early detection, treatment and care Although CKDu was first identified in Sri Lanka in the 1990s, one of the main gaps identified by the group was the absence of a uniform case definition, both within the country and internationally. This impairs the ability to answer key questions, such as the true estimate of the burden of disease, the risk factors for progression, impact of interventions, and comparability across jurisdictions. The natural history of the disease needs to be studied further. The group discussed the need for modifying the existing case definition and using inclusion instead of the exclusion criteria used currently. CKD could be the overarching disease, and cases subdivided into CKDu and CKD due to other causes, such as hypertension, diabetes and others. An international group of experts from various disciplines (not limited to those involved in clinical care) should formulate a uniform case definition. This should include epidemiological, clinical and etiopathological criteria. It was also suggested that cases be divided into possible, probable and definite CKDu on the basis of the presence of defined criteria. The present staging system of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) (stages 15) could be retained. Sri Lanka should use one method of calculating the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and it was suggested that the CKD-EPI formula be used. With respect to screening, the group felt that biomarkers could not be used at present outside of the research context, but it was important to establish screening methods compatible with the regular surveillance programme using point-of-care testing machines, and testing for urine albumin/ creatinine ratio and serum creatinine. Research questions identified during the group work Group 1: Clinical aspects: early detection, treatment and care What is the case definition of CKDu? What are the indications for renal biopsy and criteria for pathological diagnosis of CKDu? What is the eGFR formula used in various laboratories and how can it be standardized based on the CKD-EPI formula? What is the population-adjusted expected normal rage for eGFR and other relevant laboratory tests? What are the valid point-of-care testing technologies that can be introduced in the screening programme? 15 Group 2: Role of agrochemicals The group identified gaps in knowledge regarding the availability of various agrochemicals, patterns of use, safe levels of agrochemicals in the environment and their health effects on humans. It reviewed the information on nephrotoxicity of various agrochemicals including such as glyphosate, propanil, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, carbofuran, profenofos, carbosulfan, carbaryl, etc. and the potential contaminants in agrochemicals such as cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As). The available evidence for their association with CKDu was reviewed including evidence regarding nephrotoxicity in vitro, in animals and in humans at high and low doses. Annex 3 provides a summary of the outcomes of the review.

and the potential contaminants in agrochemicals such as cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As). The available evidence for their association with CKDu was reviewed including evidence regarding nephrotoxicity in vitro, in animals and in humans at high and low doses. Annex 3 provides a summary of the outcomes of the review. Cd was nephrotoxic as per the literature; however, existing data from studies that measured Cd in water and biological samples was not conclusive and the clinical characteristics of the Cd-induced nephropathy seemed different from the CKDu in Sri Lanka. Per se, levels of Cd in water from studies in Sri Lanka were unlikely to account for the epidemic. Inorganic As is nephrotoxic in vitro and in animals at high doses but there is no evidence of nephrotoxicity in humans for increased risks of CKD from the epidemiological studies. There are no reports of CKDu in other populations with high As levels in water. The group consensus was that As alone is unlikely to be the causative agent of CKDu in Sri Lanka. Nephrotoxicity has been documented in the literature for humans at high doses for specific glyphosate formulations (in combination with certain adjuvants), propanil and chlorpyrifos. Association of individual pesticides with CKDu has been reported in only two studies in Sri Lanka. The evidence of causality of this association was considered inconclusive due to lack of consistency of the findings, lack of temporality where association was observed and limitations in the methods used for measuring exposures. Longitudinal well-designed studies that include healthy individuals in endemic and non-endemic areas, with bio banks, will be needed to assess the possible role of agrochemicals in causation and progression of CKDu. 16 Research questions identified during the group work Group 2: Role of agrochemicals Can existing information regarding importation, distribution and use patterns of agrochemicals be linked to the CKDu incidence? Can low doses of Cd (from food or other sources) be nephrotoxic among individuals with other risk factors (e. g. malnutrition, low birth weight) and other diseases (e. g. diabetes)? As individual agrochemicals do not seem to explain the CKDu, can synergies between individual agrochemicals or between agrochemicals and other risk factors play a role in the causation of CKDu? 17 Group 3: Water and heavy metals Several hypotheses have been put forward linking the causation of CKDu to various heavy metals and the quality and quantity of water. The group first weighed the available evidence for water and heavy metals as causative factors for CKDu. With regard to heavy metals, the group felt that the levels of these in water in Sri Lanka, particularly As and Cd, are not high enough to cause disease. Fluoride and its interaction with other constituents that add to the hardness of water is a concern. The increased risk of developing CKDu among those who drink well water as against those who drink spring water is based on anecdotal evidence and needs verification.

The group agreed that heat stress as a cause of CKDu in Sri Lanka is less clear than in Mesoamerica. However, further research is needed to understand its contribution. The group discussed the role of infections in the etiology of CKDu. Leptospirosis has a high incidence in Sri Lanka and it can cause acute interstitial nephritis and acute kidney injury. Studies from Sri Lanka have documented a high prevalence of immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies against Leptospira in the population; however, data on IgM were lacking. The role of leptospirosis and hantavirus infection as a potential risk factor should be explored further. Two available studies from Sri Lanka have reported the role of genetic susceptibility as a risk factor. The group consensus was that a shared environment probably played a more important role as compared to genetic susceptibility. The majority of the patients with CKDu were found to have a low body mass index (BMI). However, it was not certain whether it was cause or the effect of CKDu. The role of low birth weight might be is difficult to study these due to lack of good-quality historical data. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), another well-established risk factor for renal injury, was common not only in endemic areas but also in other areas and therefore it may not be a major contributory factor for CKDu. Overall, heat stress and leptospirosis were identified as two potential risk factors for further research. 20 Research questions identified during group work Group 4: Heat stress and other hypotheses Heat stress hypotheses What were the work conditions a few decades ago and is there a change in work conditions since then? Has the climate of Sri Lanka changed over the past 30 years? Has the CKDu hotspot map changed over time? Do workers experience symptoms and signs (signs of dehydration, signs of heat exposure such as rise in core temperature, heart rate, etc. and signs of acute kidney injury) of heat exposure? What is the degree of heat exposure in each region and season as measured using heat stress indices? What kind of fluids do farmers drink, from which source and what is the quantity consumed during working hours? Other hypotheses Is Leptospira DNA detectable in the biopsies done for CKDu? What is the incidence of CKDu among patients who have had leptospirosis on long-term follow up as compared with non-infected individuals? Is there a role of maternal malnutrition and low birth weight in causing CKDu? What is the nutritional status of early CKD populations? 21 Day 02 Group work: Priority costeffective interventions Group 1: Prevention The group discussed the challenges in recommending specific interventions for prevention due to lack of a clear understanding of the etiology of CKDu. The major areas of discussion were water, agrochemicals and heat stress.

21 Day 02 Group work: Priority costeffective interventions Group 1: Prevention The group discussed the challenges in recommending specific interventions for prevention due to lack of a clear understanding of the etiology of CKDu. The major areas of discussion were water, agrochemicals and heat stress. The role of heavy metals in drinking water as a causative factor for CKDu has not been established; however, access to safe drinking water is a basic human right and therefore efforts to provide safe drinking water should be accelerated in endemic areas. Various technologies such as RO water, rain water harvesting, etc. are being used in endemic areas and feasibility studies need to be conducted to identify technologies that are cost effective and appropriate and sustainable. With regard to agrochemicals, those with known nephrotoxic effects could be gradually phased out to reduce exposure in endemic areas noting, however, that they should not be replaced with products with some other important toxicity. A comprehensive programme involving regulators, retailers and farmers is needed to reduce exposure to agrochemicals. The group also emphasized the need to promote sustainable farming practices. Although the evidence for heat stress hypothesis has not been established as a causative factor for CKDu in Sri Lanka, exposure to heat should be reduced in high-risk groups in the endemic areas. There is a need to link planned interventions with improved surveillance mechanisms and information on prevalence to build an evaluation component and understand the impact. Evaluation of interventions may also provide insights regarding causes and risk factors for the disease. 23 Group 2: Early detection, treatment and care Early detection results in early treatment. For this, screening is necessary, and the current guidelines on screening for CKD are applicable to CKDu patients as well. To encourage patients to undergo screening, awareness of CKDu should be raised via the media, and efforts made by local authorities to increase participation in screening. Reduction of stigma is also necessary to encourage people to come for screening. In addition, facilities need to be provided for testing. With regard to treatment, the group felt that the current screening and management guidelines on CKD and CKDu should be revisited so that they could be adapted for use at all levels of health facilities (primary, secondary and tertiary). For those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a policy of dialysis for all should be followed, and patients undergoing dialysis supported in various ways. 24 Group 3: Surveillance The group reviewed the differences between screening and surveillance. The primary goal of surveillance is to have population-level information, while screening is meant for detection of disease/risk at the individual level. Surveillance requires high participation from the population for reliable estimates using simple tests. Screening tests need to have a good balance of sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. The existing data sources for CKD were the community-based screening programme, the national registry maintained by the Ministry of Health and a renal registry maintained by the Sri Lanka Nephrology Association.

Screening tests need to have a good balance of sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. The existing data sources for CKD were the community-based screening programme, the national registry maintained by the Ministry of Health and a renal registry maintained by the Sri Lanka Nephrology Association. The major gaps were lack of community-based surveillance and lack of linkage between the screening programme and registry. In addition, data from the two available registries need to be reconciled. The group reviewed the current status of the national renal registry and identified gaps such as lack of use of a uniform case definition, delays in data entry and inadequate analysis to inform policy-makers, and poor dissemination. The lack of robust population-level surveillance data was regarded as a hindrance to fully understanding the nature of the disease and and drawing comparisons with outbreaks in other countries. The group agreed on the need for community-based surveillance in addition to the registry through periodic surveys to monitor the disease burden in endemic and non-endemic districts. Because accurate measurement of glomerular filtration rate is not possible in field conditions there is a need to rely on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). For eGFR, a prerequisite of a meaningful community-based surveillance is the generation of populationspecific baseline data which will allow the estimation of the distribution of eGFR values and monitoring of trends over time. The objectives of community-based surveillance would be to generate baseline data for eGFR, measure the proportion of individuals below a defined cut-off and monitor trends over time. Three districts could be selected one from an endemic area, one from a non-endemic area and one from a moderately endemic area. Surveillance sites could be selected in each of the districts and a minimum of 1000 randomly selected individuals per site or all individuals in the defined geographical area should be surveyed. The need for high coverage was emphasized for the selected sites to generate reliable estimates. The ideal scenario would be to have a large number of sites to get a representative estimate at the district level; however, the time and resources required to complete one round of the survey need to be considered while finalizing the number of sites. The heterogeneity of the disease in endemic districts needs to be considered while selecting surveillance sites. The experts shared an available international protocol that could be potentially used for surveillance in Sri Lanka and would enable comparisons with other endemic countries, and facilitate identification of areas for active collaboration. The surveillance sites would then form a basis to develop research studies on various exposures of interest, such as heat stress, sources of drinking water, agrochemicals, etc. (see figure in Annex 4). Longitudinal cohort studies could also be conducted at these sites to understand the unknown aspects of CKDu. 25 Group 4: Social interventions CKDu has a devastating effect on individuals, families and the community.

(see figure in Annex 4). Longitudinal cohort studies could also be conducted at these sites to understand the unknown aspects of CKDu. 25 Group 4: Social interventions CKDu has a devastating effect on individuals, families and the community. Intense stigma is attached to the disease and the high costs of treatment push affected people into poverty, which leads to further social and health problems. There are huge gaps in knowledge among patients, and gaps in service provision. Priority interventions should be provided at three levels patient, family and community. The needs of patients and families should be elucidated through a consultative process, and patients views taken into consideration when planning interventions. Patients working conditions can be improved by speaking with their employers. Families can be provided psychosocial counselling, and children helped through school-based interventions such as foster families, and bank accounts for children so that their studies are not interrupted due to poverty/death of a parent. Self-help groups can be formed at both the family and community levels, and assistance provided to vulnerable families. In the community, trained social workers can help to support patients. In addition, informal counselling networks can be strengthened by calling upon community and religious leaders, and traditional medicine practitioners to provide support. Existing community-level workers can also be mobilized. In hospitals, clinical psychosocial workers can provide counselling and support. The group also discussed interventions that the government could provide at various levels. These should start with putting in place an organizational structure to tackle the social issues due to CKD at the national and provincial levels. An intersectoral body should be set up headed by the President/Prime Minister and coordinated by the Ministry of Health, with a Deputy Director General specially appointed for CKD, supported by a dedicated budget and intersectoral team. The fund for CKDu should be augmented, and subsidies provided for transport/medications/overnight stay for patients, especially those undergoing dialysis. Support should also be provided for children and women-headed households. A national-level communication strategy to provide information on CKDu and destigmatize the disease should be worked out. If required, brand ambassadors could be used to leverage multinational support. 26 Day 03 Framework for monitoring, implementation and accountability (I-AM) The outcome of the Consultation will inform and feed into the forthcoming National Action Plan on CKDu for Sri Lanka. In order to ensure and facilitate implementation of the National Action Plan, a framework for monitoring, implementation and accountability (I-AM) was presented. The proposed framework was developed on the basis of the Every woman Every child accountability framework model of the United Nations, which was put in place in 2010 to accelerate progress towards achievement of the Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 by 2015. The proposed framework would be three-pronged: a national committee on CKDu, an intersectoral coordinating mechanism and oversight by an independent expert review group (IERG)(Fig 1). Initial steps towards establishment of a national committee on CKDu have already been taken.

31 Develop, recommend and implement alternate pest control methods and sustainable farming practices, with a special focus on CKDu-endemic areas. Establish and update the maximum residues limits (MRL) data for pesticides based on total diet studies carried out in Sri Lanka. Minimize exposure to heat/thermal stress Implement a programme of rehydration, adequate rest and shade in occupations at high risk for heat stress/dehydration and assess their effectiveness in preventing CKDu. Early detection and management Simplify the existing CKD and CKDu screening and management guidelines, and adapt them for primary-, secondaryand tertiary-care facilities. Enhance screening coverage by improving awareness and providing point-of-care testing units (mobile) for each district. Enhance the capacity of primary care units to function as satellite renal clinics to improve access to renal care, and develop guidelines for referral from primary to tertiary care facilities. Ensure the availability of drugs and consumables. Dispense outpatient drugs for two months at a time and provide long-acting erythropoietin to reduce the number of patient visits. Discourage smoking, betel chewing and illicit use of alcohol, and include vaccination in the existing guidelines to delay the progression of renal disease. Implement a dialysis for all policy to ensure access to treatment for all patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Explore the feasibility of innovative solutions, e. g. mobile dialysis units. Seek international assistance in establishing a deceased donor programme to strengthen the transplant programme. 32 Social services: Provide social support at three levels patient, family and community. Strengthen the informal local support network (Ministry of Social Welfare) and involvement of community leaders. Develop school-based social interventions to increase accessibility and social support for children of CKDu patients. Develop a specific communication strategy to destigmatize and demystify the disease. Expand social support services and resources such as transport/medicines/overnight stay for patients, and provide appropriate financial assistance to patients. Enhance livelihood generation in affected areas and plan special initiatives to empower women who are heads of families. Capacity building: Strengthen/expand human resources at various levels. Increase the number of nephrologists from the present 1/million to about 4/million population as well as the number of nursing staff to enhance the coverage of renal services. Enhance the capacity of existing community-level workers and increase the number of community-level health workers to provide outreach services such as screening and follow up. Appoint trained social workers/counsellors in appropriate locations such as renal clinics and dialysis units to provide psychosocial support to patients and families. 33 Monitoring and accountability: Develop a framework for monitoring and accountability to ensure timely implementation of activities. Establish a three-tier system, consisting of a National Committee on CKDu, an intersectoral coordinating mechanism coordinated by the Presidential Task Force and an Independent Expert Review Group. Develop a set of performance indicators for the framework based on the National Action Plan. Ensure open and transparent measurement as well as communication. 34 Annex 1: Agenda of the meeting Day 1: 27 April 2016 Registration: 8. 30 am9. 00 am Inaugural session 9. 0010.

The cause is still unknown. The objective of this study was to describe the incidence, prevalence and trendof CKD/CKDu in North Central Province ofSri Lanka. Methods: A cross sectional survey conductedin North Central Provincewith GPS mapping inCKDu highly affected areas. The diagnosis of CKDand staging were made according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes paper. Descriptive statistics used with chi-square test for evaluating dichotomous variables. Log rank test was used to compare survival rates. The population data was obtained from the 2011 Census. Results: There were 30, 566 CKD/CKDu patients inthe North Central Province. Incidence of0. 10 in 2009, 0. 39 in 2016 inAnuradhapura district, decreased slightly to 0. 29 in2017. Incidence of 0. 09 in 2009, 0. 46 in 2016 in Polonnaruwa district, decreased slightly to 0. 41 in2017. The point prevalence inhighincidence areas ranged from 2. 444. 35. The 5year survival rate was 71. 2 (Anuradhapura 72. 4 and Polonnaruwa 68. 3, p0. 0212). More than70, 40 and 33%of patients were over 50, 60 and 70years of age respectively. A male preponderance was seen in allthe divisional areas (ranging from 1. 3: 1 to 2. 6: 1) and inall theage groups. Farmers were themost affected (70. 6% Anuradhapura district and 65. 1% Polonnaruwa district). Majority in CKD stage I(4943, 69. 6%). There were 1685 deaths (17. 5%of total CKD/CKDupatients, 67. 6% oftotal deaths in CKD/CKDu patients) occurring within the first3years ofdiagnosis. GPSmappingshows thatthere is a clustering ofhouseholds with CKD/CKDu.

T. N. Hewageegana Consultant Chemical Pathologist Dr. S Dassanayake Consultant Physician Dr. Zied Badurdeem Temporary Lecture in Pharmacology Dr. Chamly Premajayantha Medical Officer viii Introduction During the recent past, high prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease was observed in some geographic areas of Sri Lanka. Especially the North Central Province (NCP) was noted as an endemic area for CKD. Some areas outside the NCP, but geographically adjacent, were later on detected to have similarly high prevalence of CKD. Unfortunately, a fair proportion of CKD cases were not attributable to known aetiological factors. This scenario has led to coining a term Chronic Kidney Disease of Uncertain aetiology (CKDu). The unknown aetiology has hampered implementation of effective preventive measures over the years. At present, scientific data are available on the high endemicity of CKD in these areas. The World Health Organization (WHO) report on Kidney Disease of Uncertain Aetiology (CKDu) in Sri Lanka says that the age standardized prevalence of CKDu among females in the age group of 15 to 70 years of age is 16. 9% and that of males in the same age category is 12. 9%. In January 2014, the Standing Cabinet Appointed Officials Committee for the Mitigation of CKDu in the North Central Province has recommended to establish a criterion for diagnosing CKDu patients and to plan a systematic Screening Programme for early diagnosis. It has further recommended mapping the cases of CKD/CKDu considering the Grama Niladhari (GN) divisions as the base for mapping. The Screening Programme for CKD/CKDu is intended to detect asymptomatic individuals in the early stages of CKD. The screening programme will serve as a comprehensive and active epidemiological surveillance with provisions for mapping and analyzing attributes and possible aetiologies.

The Screening Programme for CKD/CKDu is intended to detect asymptomatic individuals in the early stages of CKD. The screening programme will serve as a comprehensive and active epidemiological surveillance with provisions for mapping and analyzing attributes and possible aetiologies. 1 Surveillance on Chronic Kidney Disease in Sri Lanka The Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka has established surveillance on chronic kidney disease since October 2013. Thirty hospitals were declared as sentinel sites initially with further expansion now the total number is 50. The rationale of selecting the hospitals as sentinel sites was the available statistics on the disease burden and the media reports and public concerns of the presence of the disease in geographic locations. Based on the hospital statistics and the statistics at the renal research unit, the Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura districts and geographically adjacent areas namely, Dehiattakandiya, Girandurukotte, Welioya, Polpithigama, Padavi Sripura, Wilgamuwa and Vavuniya South Divisional Secretariat divisions were proclaimed as high risk areas. The hospitals catering to the populations in the proclaimed areas were selected as sentinel sites. Another set of hospitals were selected on the basis of patients referral mechanisms, resource availability including availability of specialists services, having renal clinics. In Addition, some institutions were selected considering the potentials of having the disease, anecdotal reports on the presence of disease and public concerns on the presence of the disease. As surveillance continues, the list of sentinel sites could be evolved based on the evidence generated. 2 1. DH Padawiya 26. DH Kahatagasdigiliya 2. DH Madawachchiya 27. DH Thanamalwila 3.

Study the factors associated with the chronic Kidney Disease with uncertain aetiology 3 Methodology Screening Method Selective Screening The programme will aim at screening high risk group defined by age limits giving priorities to endemic areas. Chemical assays will be carried out on urine and blood to detect CKD/CKDu. High risk geographic areas Following a series of consultative meetings, the panel of experts decided upon the under-mentioned areas as high risk considering the present pattern of geographic distribution of cases. No Province District DS Division 01 North Central Anuradhapura All 02 North Central Polonnaruwa All 03 North Western Kurunegala Polpithigama Giribawa 04 Eastern Ampara Dehiattakandiya 05 Eastern Trincomalee Padavi Sripura 06 Uva Badulla Mahiyanganaya Rideemaliyadda 07 North Mullaitivu Welioya 08 North Vavuniya Vavuniya Vavuniya South 09 Central Matale Wilgamuwa Primary Target Group In endemic areas, those who are above the age of twenty years are eligible to be screened. In non-endemic arrears, 4 those who are above the age of thirty will be considered eligible for screening. Exclusion Criteria Those who are suffering from acute illness, pregnant women and women during menstruation are not eligible for screening. Suitable measures need to be assured to screen them once they recover from contraindications. Screening Settings Community Settings Screening will be carried out in community settings on pre determined dates with prior notification given to the target population. Screening will be carried out at Field Screening Clinics conducted in places easily accessible to the catchment population, preferably at the Gramodaya Health Centres, Central Dispensaries, Hospitals, and Offices of the Public Health Inspectors, Offices of Medical Officers of Health or any other facility depending on the programmatic feasibility. Screening Tool The screening tool is a package consisting of a combination of tests, testing for Serum Creatinine with calculating estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), measuring urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) on an early morning urine sample and measuring blood pressure. Administration of Screening Tool The tool is expected to be administered in the community setting, in a field screening clinic. The data sheet needs to be filled with legible letters and all fields must be filled. Collecting and Dispatching of Blood Samples 5 The responsibility of venipuncture and proper labelling of samples of blood is vested upon the Public Health Nursing Sister and Nursing Officer. Venipuncture should follow the routine procedure practised in hospital settings. Either plain tubes or Serum Separating Tubes (Serum separating tubes are preferred) should be used for collecting blood. 3 ml of blood is required. If plain tubes are used, the separated serum needs to be transferred to a secondary tube taking precautions to label properly. The secondary tubes or the Serum Separating Tubes (SST) should be stored in cool boxes with ice packs in a temperature ranging from 10 to 150C. The properly stored samples should reach the laboratory within a maximum of six hours.

The secondary tubes or the Serum Separating Tubes (SST) should be stored in cool boxes with ice packs in a temperature ranging from 10 to 150C. The properly stored samples should reach the laboratory within a maximum of six hours. Collecting and Dispatching Urine Samples Urine sample of 30 ml, preferably from the first or second void needs to be collected in a screw capped container. Overnight rest with a good sleep needs to be ensured before collecting the sample. Practice of proper labelling needs to be adhered to. 6 Samples should be stored in Igloo type cool boxes in the temperature range of 2 to 80C as soon as they reach the field screening clinic. Urine samples should not be stored with blood/serum samples. Urine sample should not be frozen/ kept at below 00C. Testing for serum Creatinine and calculating eGFR The testing should be done as soon as the samples reach the testing laboratory, necessarily not exceeding 24 hours from the time of sample collection. Jaffe Kinetic Method should be used in testing for serum Creatinine in an appropriated fully automated analyzer to ensure the validity of the test. CKD-EPI formula is suggested to be used to calculate eGFR. Patients age and sex are required for the calculation. Quality Assurance of laboratory tests Internal Quality Assurance Every testing laboratory should strictly follow the quality control guidelines prescribed here. At the beginning of the day, internal quality control should be performed at two levels. Further, level I II quality control should be performed on completion of every hundred tests. 7 The equipment shall be calibrated with traceability established calibrators on instructions from the manufacturer. In an event of quality failure, the equipments should be calibrated immediately. Proper maintenance of the equipment according to manufacturers instructions is mandatory. External Quality Assurance The Chemical Pathology Department of the Medical Research Institute (MRI) of Sri Lanka will serve as the national reference laboratory for external quality control of the screening programme. The MRI would o monitor the internal quality assurance serum creatinine, urine albumin and urine creatinine assays o distribute quality assurance serum and urine samples on a regular basis to selected labs o harmonize serum creatinine results between labs selected for CKD screening o achieve traceability of creatinine assay to IDMS traceable creatinine assay o Supervise on a distant basis calculation of eGFR in laboratories where chemical pathologists are not available o monitor urine albumin creatinine ratio similarly o training of MLTs in those hospitals for internal and external quality assurance o quality inspection visits Carry out monthly, inter-laboratory evaluation with standard samples. 8 Cutoff Values for Blood Pressure and Laboratory Investigations Blood Pressure 140 mmhg and 90 mmhg would be stipulated as upper limit of normal for systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively. Either of the readings above these levels would be taken as high blood pressure. Serum Creatinine Sex specific reference ranges given for creatinine assay by the manufacturer would be taken as the reference limits for serum creatinine.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Either of the readings above these levels would be taken as high blood pressure. Serum Creatinine Sex specific reference ranges given for creatinine assay by the manufacturer would be taken as the reference limits for serum creatinine. Any value above the upper reference limit would be considered as positive screening test for CKD. Estimated glomerular filtration fate (eGFR) below 60ml/1. 73m2/min is taken as positive for screening for CKD. Urine Albumin Creatinine Ratio (UACR) 30 mg/g of creatinine would be considered as the upper normal normal for UACR. Values above this level would be considered as positive in screening for CKD. Interpretation of Results If a person gets any one of the screening tests positive (serum creatinine, eGFR or UACR) he or she would be considered as positive for screening test, irrespective of their blood pressure reading levels. 9 Referral Procedure for Persons with Abnormal Test Results Persons who are negative for both investigations and for blood pressure measurements will be considered as negative for screening and reviewed in three years time in a similar screening programme. Persons who report only elevated blood pressure would be referred to nearby curative care facilities for follow up with regard to elevated blood pressure. This category is also considered as negative for the screening programme. Persons who are considered as positive (having either elevated S. Creatinine or low eGFR or elevated UACR irrespective of blood pressure levels) for screening should be channelled to curative care facilities for further evaluation by means of history, clinical examination, biochemical investigations and radiological, histological assessments (protocols need to be developed). Persons who are found positive at secondary evaluation would be referred to the Nephrologists clinics as specified in clinical management guidelines. Responsibilities Provisions of technical guidance and database management for the screening programme are vested with the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health. Implementation of the screening programme comes under the purview of provincial health authorities. In the North Central Province, the Renal Research Unit will take part in the planning and implementation of the screening programme. 10 In the districts where Medical Officers/ CKD prevention have been appointed, the MO/CKD holds the responsibility of implementation of the screening programme. In other districts where there is no appointed MO/CKD, the Regional Epidemiologist is responsible for the implementation of the screening programme. The Medical Officer of Health is held responsible for conducting screening clinics in the area according to an approved advanced programme. The heads of curative care institutions in the areas are expected to support the screening programme specially with respect to human resource mobilization. The RE or MO/CKD should liaise with the MOH and heads of curative care institutions in planning and implementation of the screening programme. Field Screening Clinics The screening clinics should be planned in such a way that once a round of screening clinic is over, the entire Medical Officer of Health area should be covered. When identifying the places, accessibility of the catchment population should be considered a priority requirement.

Field Screening Clinics The screening clinics should be planned in such a way that once a round of screening clinic is over, the entire Medical Officer of Health area should be covered. When identifying the places, accessibility of the catchment population should be considered a priority requirement. The MO/CKD or RE should work together to identify the sites to conduct Field Screen Clinics. The clinics should commence by 8. 00 am and continue till the target is covered. The clinics can be planned on any day including weekends considering the ground realities of resource mobilization. Every fortnight, a screening clinic should be conducted in the office of the MOH (Central Screening Clinic) to cater for those who missed the area field clinic. The date, time and venue of the screening clinic should be informed to the population to be screened by any means. 11 All individuals screened at the clinic should be registered in the field screening clinic and a Clinic Registration Card should be issued. All particulars should be entered in legible letters. At the time of Screening, a session on health education should be conducted according to the guidelines set by the Health Education Bureau. Human Resources The team should consist of the following categories of health staff, Medical Officers Public Health Nursing officer or Nursing Sisters or Nursing officer Public Health Midwife of the respective area Public Health Inspector of the respective area Medical Laboratory Technologists Other necessary supportive staff. Implementation Plan At the outset of the programme, an implementation plan for each district should be drafted covering the entire high risk area. The Provincial and Regional Directors of Health Services, Regional Epidemiologists, Medical Officers (CKD Prevention), Medical Officer in Charge of the Renal Research Unit of the NCP (in case of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Districts only) and heads of curative care institutions should take part in the planning process. The areas with high disease burden should be covered in the initial stages of the programme. 12 Following factors need to be considered in planning the programme. Spatial distribution of cases Availability of logistics Availability of human resources Capacities of laboratories to handle samples Routine health care delivery in the field The plan should include The number of clinic sessions per district with a breakdown at MOH division level for each quarter Locations of field screening clinics Tentative date of each clinic Locations and tentative dates of central screening clinics The number of individuals to be covered in each clinic session Human resource mobilization plan for each clinic The tentative district programme should be submitted to the Deputy Director General of Health Services (Public Health Services) I and the Chief Epidemiologist. Monitoring and Evaluation The programe would be continuously monitored and evaluated quarterly at district, provincial and national level. The Regional Directors and the Provincial Directors should continuously monitor the implementation of the screening programme in the respective districts and provinces.

VACCINES AND DIALYSIS What You Need to Know www. kidney. org COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. About the Information in this Booklet Did you know that the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) offers guidelines and commentaries that help your healthcare provider make decisions about your medical treatment? The information in this booklet is based on those recommended guidelines. Stages of Kidney Disease There are five stages of kidney disease. They are shown in the table below. Your healthcare provider determines your stage of kidney disease, based on the presence of kidney damage and your glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is a measure of your kidney function. Your treatment is based on your stage of kidney disease. Speak to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your stage of kidney disease or your treatment. STAGES OF KIDNEY DISEASE Stage Description Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) Kidney damage (e. g. , protein 1 90 or above in the urine) with normal GFR Kidney damage with mild 2 60 to 89 decrease in GFR 3 Moderate decrease in GFR 30 to 59 4 Severe reduction in GFR 15 to 29 5 Kidney failure Less than 15 Your GFR number tells your healthcare provider how much kidney function you have. As chronic kidney disease progresses, your GFR number decreases. 2 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE.

This educational brochure will help answer some questions you may have about vaccines for people on dialysis. Why do I need vaccines? Vaccines help protect people from diseases caused by infections from certain germs (viruses or bacteria). Some common diseases are the flu (or influenza), hepatitis B, tetanus, pneumococcus, and others. Many of these diseases can make you very sick and cause death. People with these diseases can pass them along and make others around them sick, so vaccines can also help protect others.

Some common diseases are the flu (or influenza), hepatitis B, tetanus, pneumococcus, and others. Many of these diseases can make you very sick and cause death. People with these diseases can pass them along and make others around them sick, so vaccines can also help protect others. Certain people have a higher chance of being seriously ill from these diseases, so they especially need protection. They include the elderly, children, and people with chronic illnesses including those on dialysis. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. Do I need vaccines if I am on dialysis? Yes. Your bodys immune system helps protect you from infections. However, people on dialysis can have weaker immune systems, making it harder to fight off infections. People on dialysis have a greater chance of getting an infection. There is also a greater chance of that infection becoming serious. Therefore, vaccines are an important part of healthcare for people on dialysis. How do vaccines work? Vaccines are usually given as a shot (an injection with a small needle). They protect you by helping your bodys immune system prepare for a real infection. To do this, vaccines contain parts of a dead or weakened germ. Once you get the shot, your body produces antibodies, which help your body find and kill these germs. Should you come in contact with the real germ, these antibodies will work to protect you. Some vaccines need a booster shot to help your bodys immune system make enough antibodies. This is why some vaccines might need one shot, while others need more than one shot. In some cases, a blood test is used to make sure there are enough antibodies for protection. Are vaccines safe? Vaccines are among the safest therapies available. They have protected millions of people from serious diseases. As with any medicine, there are some possible side effects. Some people could feel minor discomfort. There could be some soreness or a mild rash on the skin where the shot was given. Others might get a slight fever. However, these mild effects are normal and should not cause alarm. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 5 COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. There are some people who should not receive vaccines, including those allergic to vaccines, or people with an overactive immune system. Also, women who are pregnant, people with a kidney transplant, or those with a less active immune system should not receive certain vaccines. Some people are concerned that vaccines might cause autism. However, multiple studies show that there is no connection between receiving vaccines and getting autism. The possible harm from vaccines is very small. The possible harm from infection is much greater. As with any medicine, talk with a healthcare provider about any questions or concerns you have about vaccines. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE.

The possible harm from infection is much greater. As with any medicine, talk with a healthcare provider about any questions or concerns you have about vaccines. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. Which vaccinations do I need and when do I need them? Vaccines that are recommended for people on dialysis include flu (or influenza), hepatitis B, pneumococcus, Tdap (tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis), and others. You might need one shot to protect you for life. Other vaccines might need more than one shot to build up enough protection. Flu The flu (or influenza) vaccine is commonly called the flu shot. It needs to be given once per year, usually in the fall before flu season begins. The flu shot helps prevent infection from the influenza virus. Flu symptoms can include headaches, body aches, high fever, sore throat, fatigue, and a runny nose. The flu can be passed along by casual, person-toperson contact. A flu infection can be very serious for people with a weaker immune system. People on dialysis have a greater chance of getting the flu, so yearly vaccination is very important. Hepatitis B The hepatitis B vaccine helps protect against an infection from the hepatitis B virus (also known as HBV, or hep B). The hepatitis B virus attacks the liver. Symptoms of hepatitis B can include loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, fever, extreme tiredness, or stomach or joint pain. Some of these symptoms are similar to the flu. However, hepatitis B can also cause a yellowing of the skin or eyes. A blood test can help prove if you have hepatitis B. A hepatitis B infection can cause liver failure or liver cancer. Some people (known as carriers) with hepatitis B have no symptoms, but are still able to infect others. Hepatitis B cannot spread by casual, person-to-person WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 7 COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. contact, so it cannot be passed along by hugging or shaking hands. It is passed along by direct contact with the blood of an infected person. The chance of getting hepatitis B through dialysis treatment is low because of strict infection control measures in dialysis units, and the availability of the hepatitis B vaccine. However, people on dialysis should still get vaccinated. People are usually given 3 shots to develop protection against HBV. However, people on dialysis might need more shots or a higher dose to develop enough protection. Talk to your healthcare provider about timing and dosage. Pneumococcus The pneumococcal vaccine helps protect against infection from pneumococcal bacteria. There are two types of pneumococcal vaccines: PPSV23 and PCV13. People on dialysis should receive both vaccines. Pneumococcal bacteria can infect many parts of the body. If it infects the lungs, it causes pneumonia. If it enters the bloodstream, it can cause sepsis, leading to poor blood flow and organ damage. Pneumococcal bacteria can infect the covering of the heart. It can also attack the nervous system and cause meningitis.

If it infects the lungs, it causes pneumonia. If it enters the bloodstream, it can cause sepsis, leading to poor blood flow and organ damage. Pneumococcal bacteria can infect the covering of the heart. It can also attack the nervous system and cause meningitis. These infections are very serious and can cause death. Because different parts of the body can be infected, symptoms can vary from person to person, and can appear very suddenly and without warning. Depending if the infection causes pneumonia, sepsis, or meningitis, people can feel some combination of these symptomsfever, shaking/chills, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, stiff neck, or disorientation. 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. Some people have a greater chance of getting a pneumococcal infection, including the very young and people 65 years and older. People on dialysis also have a higher chance. Depending on the vaccine and the person, 1 or 2 shots might be needed, followed by a booster shot in 5 years. Ask your healthcare provider about timing and spacing. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 9 COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. Tdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis) The Tdap vaccine can protect against infections from three different kinds of germs (bacteria)tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Diphtheria and pertussis are passed along by casual, person-to-person contact. People can get tetanus from cuts, scrapes, punctures, or other wounds. Diphtheria is rare in the United States, but it can be a serious infection of the nose and throat. Symptoms can include fever, sore throat, weakness, or swollen glands. A telltale sign of diphtheria is a thick coating in the back of the throat, which makes it very difficult to breathe. Diphtheria can also lead to paralysis or heart failure. 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. Pertussis is also known as whooping cough. Symptoms can include congestion, runny nose, fever, watery eyes, and cough. Pertussis can cause coughing spells that make it hard to breathe or sleep. It can also lead to vomiting and weight loss. A person with pertussis may need to be in the hospital. Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is rare in the United States today. Symptoms can include muscle stiffness or tightening that is painful, and usually felt all over the body. Tetanus is known as lockjaw because the muscles in the head and neck may tighten. This makes it harder to open ones mouth, swallow, or even breathe. To protect against these three diseases, most children are given 5 shots between the ages of 2 months and 6 years. If vaccination was not done during early childhood, one dose of the Tdap vaccine is given at age 11 or 12. A booster vaccine for tetanus and diphtheria (Td) should be given every 10 years. People on dialysis need to receive the Tdap vaccine and Td booster for protection against these diseases.

A booster vaccine for tetanus and diphtheria (Td) should be given every 10 years. People on dialysis need to receive the Tdap vaccine and Td booster for protection against these diseases. Other Vaccines There are many other vaccines recommended for people receiving dialysis, including measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), varicella (chickenpox), meningococcus, and human papilloma virus (HPV). There is also a vaccine to protect against hepatitis A virus (HAV), which attacks the liver. It can be very serious and can spread to make other people sick. Hepatitis A is spread through close personal contact and by eating contaminated food or water. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 11 COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE. Vaccination Schedules There are certain times when you should get vaccinated. You may have received some of these vaccines when you were younger. You may only need one dose of a vaccine, or more than one dose of the same vaccine. Some vaccines are given if you travel, so check with your healthcare provider before any planned trips. The following table lists vaccines that are recommended for people on dialysis and the number of doses. Check with your healthcare provider about the vaccines you already received or the ones you might still need. VACCINES RECOMMENDED FOR ADULTS ON DIALYSIS Vaccine Dosage Flu (influenza) 1 dose per year Hepatitis B virus (HBV) 3 doses Ask your healthcare provider about timing and dosage Hepatitis A virus (HAV) 2 doses Pneumococcal Pneumonia (2 types of 1 or 2 doses vaccines) Ask your healthcare provider about timing and spacing Tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Td/Tdap) 1-time dose of Tdap, then Td booster every 10 years Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) 1 or 2 doses Human papillomavirus (HPV) Female: 3 doses up to age 26 Male: 3 doses up to age 21 Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) 1 or 3 doses Varicella (Chickenpox) 1 dose Meningococcal (meningitis) Use if needed, 1 or more doses (dependent on patient) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) People on dialysis might need more shots or a higher dose. 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION.

WORKING WITH CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE www. kidney. org Many people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or kidney failure work full time or part time. Some go to school, or take care of their homes and families. Others do volunteer work, have hobbies or have regular exercise routines. If you have kidney disease or kidney failure, you may have questions about working. This brochure will answer many of your questions. I was working before my kidneys failed. Will I be able to go back to work? Many people who start dialysis or have a transplant want to go back to work quickly. They may feel work will help their lives get back to normal. Some people take a little time off to start dialysis. Others take a longer time to get used to dialysis or to recover from transplant surgery. Talk to your doctor about going back to work. I am not working now. Are there ways to help me find a job? Yes. There are many services for people looking for jobs. Some are private companies. Others are government agencies. They can help you decide what kind of job you want and what you are qualified to do. They can help you write a resume and get 2 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION ready for interviews. Remember that some private companies will expect payment for their services. Some popular job-hunting resources are: Monster. com Careerbuilder. com Craigslist. com Indeed. com SimplyHired. com Dice. com Glassdoor. com the Help Wanted section of local newspapers employment and temporary agencies state client assistance programs Job Corps state or local employment agencies Your social worker can help you. Some government agencies may even help pay for training. If you find work through a state or federal vocational rehabilitation agency, your employer may be able to get a tax credit for hiring you. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 3 If you are entering the job market for the first time, you may need or want some more education. Most schools have guidance counselors and employment counselors. These people can help you decide what your needs are, based on the work you want to do. How can I get ready for job hunting? Start by writing a résumé. This is a record of your education and your work history. You may want to do your résumé on a computer so you can email it and post it to job websites. A résumé includes: your name, address, email address, and telephone number(s) a summary of your work experience (both paid and volunteer) your educational history any special skills you have that may help you qualify for a job the names of two or three referencespeople you know who would recommend you for a job any special interests, hobbies, or organizations you participate in, especially if they reflect your career goals or show that you are an active member of your community 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION What happens at a job interview?

During a job interview, you will meet with someone from the company, often from the companys human resources department. They will tell you about the company and describe the job. This is your chance to talk to them about your skills. You should talk about the things that you do well. Dont be afraid to talk about skills you learned while doing volunteer work. Dont be afraid to ask questions about the company and the position. You will make a good impression if you show you are interested in the company and want to learn about it. Should I tell the company about my illness and treatment? If you think that your illness and treatment will not interfere with your ability to do the job, you do not need to mention it during an interview. What if I am working when I begin treatment? Some people continue to work full time when they begin treatment. Others switch to a part-time or flexible schedule. Some people ask for less physically demanding jobs. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 5 You may need to work different hours to go to hemodialysis. Or you may need a clean, private area where you can do peritoneal dialysis. You should feel free to talk to your employer about job changes that might make it easier for you to work. Remember, your employer probably wont know what changes you might need if you dont ask for them. Your employer may not know much about kidney disease or how it may affect your abilities. There might be concerns about how much work you can do and how much time off you will need. There could also be concerns about how much your health benefits will cost the company. You may want to ask your doctor or another member of your healthcare team to talk with your employer about these. A little information about your illness, abilities, and limitations can do a lot to ease an employers concerns. Here are a few of the topics you and your employer may want to discuss: changing your work schedule to allow for dialysis and healthcare visits making up time taken off for medical reasons 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION physical limitations, if any what to do in case of an emergency Employers may not know about tax credits they can get for making changes to the workplace. Are there laws to protect me against job discrimination? The Civil Rights Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act all protect you from job discrimination. Examples of discrimination include being fired or being turned down for a job or a promotion because of an illness or condition that does not affect your ability to do your job. The Department of Labor handles complaints filed under the Rehabilitation Act. If you work for a company with 15 or more employees, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires your employer to make any reasonable accommodations that you might need in order to work.

Am I entitled to company health insurance? If the company offers health insurance to all of its employees who work the same number of hours that you work, you must be offered the same coverage. Read the policy carefully to see if it covers treatment for kidney disease. If the policy says there is a waiting period for employees with existing health conditions, there could be a delay in your coverage. If you had health insurance less than 63 days before getting new coverage, you may have met all or part of the waiting period. Ask your old insurance company to give you a Certificate of Credible Coverage and give it to 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION your new health plans administrator. Your state insurance commissioners office can tell you more about the laws covering group health insurance companies. TIP If you are undergoing treatment for kidney failure, you should know that many of the costs for dialysis and kidney transplant are covered by the federal government through Medicare. Medicare is not just for people who are 65 and older. The program also helps Americans and legal residents of all ages who need dialysis or a kidney transplant and qualify for coverage. What kinds of disability benefits can I get if I cant work? Most people need financial help if they cant work. Your social worker can give you information about financial programs, what the qualifications are, and how to apply. The Federal government runs two of the bestknown programs. Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is a program of the Social Security Administration. It pays a monthly cash benefit to people who are not able to work for a year or more because of a disability. The amount you get depends on the WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 11 length of time you worked before your disability and the amount of tax taken out of your earnings during that time. Your familys current income level doesnt affect the amount that you get. There is a 35 month review period for applications. If you stopped working before you applied, you may qualify for back benefits. You can apply for SSDI online at: www. ssa. gov/ applyfordisability/ Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is also paid by the Social Security Administration. Benefits are calculated based on the persons financial needs, not the amount of tax that they paid. SSI pays its benefits on a monthly basis. This amount may be supplemented by state or local benefits. You must file an application with Social Security to be considered. Are there any government programs that help people with kidney disease or kidney failure find work? Social Security has many programs to help you find work. If you receive either SSDI or SSI, ask your social worker or Social Security representative for information about work incentive programs to help you 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION ease back into work. One of them is the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency program.

Most people with kidney disease or kidney failure have anemiaa low red blood cell countwhich causes muscle weakness and fatigue. A medication called an erythropoiesisstimulating agent (ESA) is used to treat anemia. Ask your doctor about ESA therapy. WWW. KIDNEY. ORG 15 Stay active. Doing chores, exercising, or enjoying your hobbies will keep your body in motion; this can give you more energy. It also helps your muscles. Talk to your doctor about an exercise program that is right for you (see the National Kidney Foundation brochure Staying Fit with Kidney Disease). Follow a healthy diet. Talk to your dietitian about foods that can help. (See the National Kidney Foundation brochures Nutrition and Hemodialysis, Nutrition and Peritoneal Dialysis, and Nutrition and Transplantation. ) What else can I do to cope? At first, changes in your health may make it hard to think about the future. You may feel angry, sad, or even guilty. These are normal feelings and are part of the adjustment process. Sometimes these bad thoughts or feelings can drain your energy and make it hard to enjoy life. Many people find that staying busy helps. When bad thoughts or feelings like sadness, anger or guilt last longer than a couple of weeks, they can lead to depression. Talk with your social worker or your doctor about how to get help if youre feeling overly sad, sleeping or eating too much, being 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION unable to sleep or eat, feeling like you want to give up or harm yourself, or feeling isolated and alone. You may be experiencing depression. Depression can be treated with counseling and medication. Rememberyou have choices. Many people say they feel better and more in control of their lives when they learn more about kidney disease and how to take care of themselves. What else should I know? You might need help to go back to a full, productive life after being diagnosed. Your family, friends, employers, and healthcare staff can help. But the most important person in the rehabilitation plan is YOU. It will take hard work to cope with the changes caused by your illness. But the results can be worth the effort. If you take charge of your rehabilitation, and ask others for help when you need it, you are likely to be successful. The National Kidney Foundation can provide information.

Review Chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology in Sri Lanka Senaka Rajapakse1, Mitrakrishnan Chrishan Shivanthan2, Mathu Selvarajah3 1Faculty of Medicine, Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Colombo, Colombo, Sri Lanka, 2Vijaya Kumarathunga Memorial Hospital, Seeduwa, Sri Lanka, 3Nephrology Unit, General Hospital, Kurunegala, Sri Lanka Introduction: In the last two decades, chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) has emerged as a significant contributor to the burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in rural Sri Lanka. It is characterized by the absence of identified causes for CKD. The prevalence of CKDu is 15. 122. 9% in some Sri Lankan districts, and previous research has found an association with farming occupations. Methods: A systematic literature review in Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, and Lilacs databases identified 46 eligible peer-reviewed articles and one conference abstract. Results: Geographical mapping indicates a relationship between CKDu and agricultural irrigation water sources. Health mapping studies, human biological studies, and environment-based studies have explored possible causative agents. Most studies focused on likely causative agents related to agricultural practices, geographical distribution based on the prevalence and incidence of CKDu, and contaminants identified in drinking water. Nonetheless, the link between agrochemicals or heavy metals and CKDu remains to be established. No definitive cause for CKDu has been identified. Discussion: Evidence to date suggests that the disease is related to one or more environmental agents, however pinpointing a definite cause for CKDu is challenging. It is plausible that CKDu is multifactorial. No specific guidelines or recommendations exist for treatment of CKDu, and standard management protocols for CKD apply.
