ABSTRACT This article discusses in detail the drugs used to prevent chronic kidney disease and the diseases that result from them. Chronic kidney disease is developing rapidly today, and short-term treatments are being found in medicine. KEYWORDS Chronic kidney disease, diagnosis, transplant, glomerular filtration rate.

This can happen all kidney disease. Also called renal disease, of a sudden or over time. 1 Chronic kidney kidney disease is the general term for damage disease (chronic kidney disease) has five distinct stages. that reduces function of the kidney.
