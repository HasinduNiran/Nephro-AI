ORG 25 Setting a standard for care The National Kidney Foundation, through its Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI), defines stages of kidney disease and offers guidelines that help your healthcare professional and healthcare team make important decisions about your medical treatment. The information in this booklet is based on those recommended guidelines. The information contained in this publication is based on current data and expert guidance available at the time of publication. The information is intended to help patients become aware of their disease and its management. This publication is not intended to set out a preferred standard of care and should not be construed as one. Neither should the information be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. Patients should always consult with their healthcare professional regarding decisions about their individual plan of care. 26 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION KIDNEY.
