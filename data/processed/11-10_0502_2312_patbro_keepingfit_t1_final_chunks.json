ORG 3 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition that affects the kidneys ability to function effectively. Over time, CKD can lead to a range of health issues, including high blood pressure, anemia, and bone health problems. The disease often progresses silently, making it crucial to manage it proactively. Exercise is important because it can improve some common health issues people with CKD face. Physical activity can help control blood pressure, improve muscle function, and enhance overall well-being. A simple 20-minute walk daily can make a big difference in your health. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION The Importance of Exercise Exercise isnt just for those who are already fit; its an important part of helping to manage chronic diseases, including CKD. Doing regular exercise is good for you in a number of ways. Its not just about getting stronger; it also helps you feel better emotionally and may also slow down the progression of CKD.

Heres how: Physical Benefits Exercise is good for your body in many ways. It can strengthen your heart, help you build muscle, and give you more energy. Many people with CKD often feel tired and notice their muscles getting weaker. Exercise can help turn this around, making you feel more energetic and stronger. Psychological Benefits Regular exercise can also lift your spirits and help you feel less stressed or down. Many people with long-term health issues like CKD often feel anxious or sad, and exercise can make a big difference in improving these feelings. Plus, when you see what your body can achieve, it boosts your self-confidence. If you join a group for exercise, like a walking group or a fitness class, you also get the chance to meet new people and make friends, which can make you feel even better. KIDNEY. ORG 5 How Exercise Can Help Exercise can make a big difference in slowing down the effects of CKD. It can help keep your blood pressure in a healthy range and make sure your body uses sugar properly. This is really good for your kidneys. Plus, if you have other health problems like diabetes or heart issues, which many people with CKD do, exercise can help manage those too. Before You Start Talk to Your Doctor Before you start any kind of exercise program, its really important to talk to your doctor. Exercise may have an effect on how certain medicines work and other parts of your treatment. Some people have even needed to change their medicines to fit better with their new exercise routine. Check-Ups You Might Need Your doctor might want to do tests like blood work or heart checks to see how fit you are and what kind of exercise is safe for you. These tests give you and your doctor a starting point to make an exercise plan just for you. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Make a Plan You Can Stick To After youve talked to your doctor and maybe had some tests, the next step is to make a plan. Choose goals that you can really achieve. It could be as simple as walking for 20 minutes a day or going to a yoga class once a week. When you set goals you can reach, youre more likely to stick with your exercise routine. KIDNEY. ORG 7 Types of Exercise When it comes to exercise, variety is key. Mixing up your routine with stretching, strength training, and cardiovascular activities can offer a well-rounded approach to fitness. This is especially helpful for people with conditions such as muscle stiffness or high blood pressure. Use this guide to help you choose the right mix of activities.",

This is really good for people with CKD, who might get muscle cramps or feel stiff. Try doing 10 minutes of stretching and bending before and after you do any harder exercises to make your workout even better. Building Muscle Lifting light weights or using resistance bands helps build muscle and make your bones stronger. This is especially important for people with CKD, who might notice their muscles getting weaker. Just make sure to start with lighter weights and slowly work your way up to avoid hurting yourself. KIDNEY. ORG 9 Get Your Heart Pumping Walking, biking, and swimming are all good for your heart and can give you more energy. These are also good for helping to keep your blood pressure in check. Starting with a 30-minute walk, three times a week is a good way to get started. Making an Exercise Plan Creating a workout plan is a great first step. Its important to set up a daily exercise plan, figure out how much exercise you need every week, and understand why rest days are important. Setting Up a Routine Having a regular exercise schedule can help you get the most out of being active. You may think about doing different exercises at different times of the day. For example, you could stretch in the morning, lift some light weights in the afternoon, and take a walk in the evening. 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How Often and for How Long Most experts say you should aim for about 150 minutes of heart-pumping exercise each week. You can break this down in different ways to best fit your schedule. For example, you could do five 30-minute workouts or three longer ones that last about 50 minutes each. Taking Breaks Dont forget! Rest days are just as important as the days you exercise. Your muscles need time to recover so you dont get hurt. Make sure to take at least one or two days off each week to rest and recover. Patients on Dialysis and Exercise People on dialysis who exercise regularly report they sleep better, have more energy and more muscle strength, and are better able to do the things they need to do in their lives. Exercise Timing for People on Dialysis Timing your exercise around your dialysis sessions is important for avoiding fatigue and muscle cramps.",

    "text": "Exercise Timing for People on Dialysis Timing your exercise around your dialysis sessions is important for avoiding fatigue and muscle cramps. Its usually best to avoid working out right before or after your dialysis session. Some people find that exercising on non-dialysis days or at least 3 to 4 hours before or after a session works best for them. Some helpful tips include: Be careful about exercising right after hemodialysis, as it may lower your blood pressure too much. KIDNEY. ORG 11 If you want to do weight or resistance training, you should check with your dialysis team before starting, since people on: Hemodialysis should avoid any stress on your fistula or graft arm. Peritoneal dialysis need to make sure that your catheter stays securely in place. Ask your hemodialysis team about exercise with a minibike or any other exercises that can be done during treatments. If you are on peritoneal dialysis, you might be more comfortable exercising on an empty stomach. Skip exercise if youve missed a dialysis session and have extra fluid. Choose Low-Impact Exercises People on dialysis often find that low-impact exercises are the most comfortable. Swimming and cycling are good choices because theyre easier on your joints but still give you a solid workout. Water aerobics is another good choice that is easy on the joints and can improve strength and flexibility. If you are on peritoneal dialysis and would like to swim, talk to your dialysis team about how to protect your exit site and which kinds of water are safe to swim in. 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Keeping Track of Your Health Its really important to keep a close eye on how youre doing if youre on dialysis and starting to exercise. Your healthcare team should know about your exercise plans and may need to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and your dialysis prescription more often. This makes sure that the exercise you choose is both good for you and doesnt cause any problems with your dialysis treatment. KIDNEY. ORG 13 Talk to Your Kidney Dietitian Dialysis and exercise both have an impact on the nutrients in your body. Dialysis can remove some important nutrients, while exercise uses up energy and can affect things like your blood sugar and electrolyte levels. Sweating may also affect how much fluid you need. Thats why its a good idea to talk to a kidney dietitian. They can tell you which foods to eat and how much fluid to drink to keep everything well-balanced. This is especially important if youre planning to exercise more, as youll need the right fuel and fluid to keep you healthy and help your body recover well afterward. 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION A dietitian can also help you adjust your meal timing around your exercise and dialysis schedules for the best results.

Exercise After Kidney Transplant After a kidney transplant, staying active is still important for keeping healthy. However, there are some special things to think about: Talk to Your Healthcare Team: Talk to your healthcare provider before starting or changing your exercise routine. They can help you understand how your medications and new kidney will react to physical activity. Start Slow: Your body has been through a lot. Start with low-impact exercises and gradually build up your strength. Be Mindful of Surgical Sites: In the early months after a kidney transplant, avoid exercises that put pressure on or involve the surgical area. Monitor for Symptoms: Pay close attention to how you feel during and after exercise. If you notice anything unusual, contact your healthcare provider immediately. KIDNEY. ORG 15 Nutrition and Hydration: Your nutritional needs may be different post-transplant. Talk to your healthcare provider or a kidney dietitian about choosing foods and fluids that are best for you, especially when you are exercising. By paying attention to these important tips, you can exercise in a way thats safe for you and also helps your new kidney work well for a long time. 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Nutrition and Hydration Eating well and staying hydrated are important parts of an effective exercise routine. Here are some tips to help you make good choices before, during, and after your workouts. Plan Your Pre-exercise Meal Eating the right foods before you exercise can give you the energy you need to get through your workout. Try to eat a well-balanced meal about 1 to 2 hours before you start exercising. A meal with plenty of carbohydrates, a moderate amount of protein, and low fat is a good choice. For example, a sandwich made with whole-grain bread and lean meat, along with a side of fruit. Stay Well-hydrated Hydration is super important, especially for people with CKD who may have limits on how much fluid they can have. Always check with your healthcare provider to find out how much you should be drinking when you exercise. A small glass of water before and after your workout is usually a good idea, but your doctor can give you personalized advice. KIDNEY. ORG 17 Eating After Exercise Once youve finished your workout, its important to eat something to help your body recover. Your muscles need protein to repair themselves, and youll need carbohydrates to regain your energy. A lowsugar protein shake or a bowl of whole-grain cereal with skim milk are usually good options. Timing Matters The timing of your meals and hydration can also affect how well you perform and recover. Eating too close to your workout can make you feel sluggish, while not eating enough can leave you feeling weak.",

However, these products often contain added sugars, electrolytes, or other compounds that may not be best for people with CKD. Before using any products, check with your healthcare provider to make sure its right for you. Staying Safe While Exercising Safety is a top priority when exercising, especially for people with certain health conditions. Here are some guidelines to help you exercise safely and recognize warning signs. Warm-Up and Cool-Down Starting and finishing your workout the right way can make a big difference. A 5to 10-minute warm-up, like a brisk walk, gets your body ready. After your workout, take another 5 to 10 minutes to cool down with some easy stretches. This helps your muscles relax, and your heart rate returns to normal. KIDNEY. ORG 19 Listen to Your Body Being in tune with your body is key to a safe and effective workout. While exercise should challenge you, it shouldnt cause pain or extreme discomfort. Here are some things watch for: Breathing: Its normal to breathe faster when you exercise, but you should still be able to talk. If youre gasping for air, its a sign to slow down. Muscle Sensations: A mild burn in your muscles is a good sign theyre being worked, but sharp, sudden pain is a red flag. Energy Levels: Feeling tired is part of exercising, but theres a difference between workout fatigue and extreme exhaustion. If you feel like you cant go on, its time to stop. Mental State: Exercise often boosts mood, but if you feel irritable, agitated, or mentally drained, consider winding down your session. Heart Rate: While its normal for your heart rate to increase, it shouldnt feel like your heart is pounding. You may find it helpful to use a monitor to keep track of your heart rate. If you start to feel somethings not right, like youre too tired or hurting, its a good idea to stop exercising right away. Take a break, drink water, and see if you feel better. 20 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Getting Medical Attention Being aware of how you feel during exercise is key to your safety.
