If cystatin C is available, the GFR category should be estimatedfromthecombinationofcreatinineandcystatinC(creatinineandcystatin Cbased estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFRcr-cys) (1B). 1. 1. 3 Evaluation of chronicity Practice Point 1. 1. 3. 1: Proof of chronicity (duration of a minimum of 3 months) can be established by: (i) review of past measurements/estimations of GFR; (ii) review of past measurements of albuminuria or proteinuria and urine microscopic examinations; (iii)imaging findings such as reduced kidney size and reduction in cortical thickness; (iv) kidney pathological findings such as fibrosis and atrophy; (v) medical history, especially conditions known to cause or contribute to CKD; (vi) repeat measurements within and beyond the 3-month point. Practice Point 1. 1. 3. 2: Do not assume chronicity based upon a single abnormal level for eGFR and ACR, as the finding could be the result of a recent acute kidney injury (AKI) event or acute kidney disease (AKD).

Practice Point 1. 3. 2. 2: Implementation of an external quality assessment scheme/program for urine albumin and creatinine, including calculation of the ACR, is a preferred practice for laboratories. 1. 4 Point-of-care testing Recommendation 1. 4. 1: We suggest that point-of-care testing (POCT) may be used for creatinine and urine albuminmeasurementwhereaccesstoalaboratoryislimitedorprovidingatestatthe point-of-care facilitates the clinical pathway (2C). Practice Point 1. 4. 1: Whenever a POCT device is used for creatinine and urine albumin testing, ensure that the same preanalytical, analytical, and postanalytical quality criteria relating to the specimen collection and performance ofthedevice, includingexternal qualityassessment, andthe interpretationofthe resultisused. Practice Point 1. 4. 2: Where a POCT device for creatinine testing is being used, generate an estimate of GFR. Use the equation consistent with that used within the region. Practice Point 1. 4. 3: Where a POCT device is being used for albuminuria testing, the capability of also analyzing creatinine and producing an ACR is important. Assess the ability of the POCT ACR devices to produceapositiveresultin85%ofpeoplewithsignificantalbuminuria(ACR30mg/gor3mg/ mmol), as part of the evaluation and consideration of using the device. Chapter 2: Risk assessment in people with CKD 2. 1 Overview on monitoring for progression of CKD based upon GFR and ACR categories Practice Point 2. 1. 1: Assess albuminuria in adults, or albuminuria/proteinuria in children, and GFR at least annually in people with CKD. Practice Point 2. 1. 2: Assess albuminuria and GFR more often for individuals at higher risk of CKD progression when measurement will impact therapeutic decisions. Practice Point 2. 1. 3: For people with CKD, a change in eGFR of 20% on a subsequent test exceeds the expected variability and warrants evaluation. Practice Point 2. 1. 4: Among people with CKD who initiate hemodynamically active therapies, GFR reductions of 30% on subsequent testing exceed the expected variability and warrant evaluation. Practice Point 2. 1. 5: For albuminuria monitoring of people with CKD, a doubling of the ACR on a subsequent test exceeds laboratory variability and warrants evaluation.

Practice Point 2. 2. 2: A 2-year kidney failure risk of 10% can be used to determine the timing of multidisciplinary care in addition to eGFR-based criteria and other clinical considerations. Practice Point 2. 2. 3: A 2-year kidney failure risk threshold of 40% can be used to determine the modality education, timing of preparation for kidney replacement therapy (KRT) including vascular access planning or referral for transplantation, in addition to eGFR-based criteria and other clinical considerations.

Key recommendations and practice points are highlighted: Recommendation 3. 6. 1: We recommend starting renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (RASi) (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ACEi or angiotensin II receptor blocker ARB) for people with CKD and severely increased albuminuria (G1G4, A3) without diabetes (1B). Recommendation3. 6. 2: WesuggeststartingRASi(ACEiorARB)forpeoplewithCKDandmoderatelyincreased albuminuria (G1G4, A2) without diabetes (2C). Recommendation 3. 6. 3: We recommend starting RASi (ACEi or ARB) for people with CKD and moderately-toseverely increased albuminuria (G1G4, A2 and A3) with diabetes (1B). Recommendation 3. 6. 4: We recommend avoiding any combination of ACEi, ARB, and direct renin inhibitor (DRI) therapy in people with CKD, with or without diabetes (1B). S158 KidneyInternational(2024)105(Suppl4S), S117S314 www. kidney-international. org summary of recommendation statements and practice points Practice Point 3. 6. 1: RASi (ACEi or ARB) should be administered using the highest approved dose that is tolerated to achieve thebenefitsdescribedbecausetheproven benefitswere achievedintrials using thesedoses. Practice Point 3. 6. 2: Changes in BP, serum creatinine, and serum potassium should be checked within 24 weeks of initiation or increase in the dose of a RASi, depending on the current GFR and serum potassium. Practice Point 3. 6. 3: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi.",
    "Practice Point 3. 6. 3: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi. Practice Point 3. 6. 4: Continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose. Practice Point 3. 6. 5: Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR 15 ml/min per 1. 73 m2). PracticePoint3. 6. 6: ConsiderstartingpeoplewithCKDwithnormaltomildlyincreasedalbuminuria(A1)onRASi(ACEior ARB) for specific indications (e. g. , to treat hypertension or heart failure with low ejection fraction). Practice Point 3. 6. 7: ContinueACEiorARB in peoplewithCKD even when the eGFR falls below 30 ml/min per 1. 73 m2. 3. 7 Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease, which stated: We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR 20 ml/min per 1. 73m2withanSGLT2i(1A). 23However, inthepresentguideline, weofferamoregeneral1Arecommendationforadultswith CKD.

Practice Point 3. 7. 1: Once an SGLT2i is initiated, it is reasonable to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR falls below 20 ml/min per 1. 73 m2, unless it is not tolerated or KRT is initiated. Practice Point 3. 7. 2: It is reasonable to withhold SGLT2i during times of prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical medical illness (when people may be at greater risk for ketosis). Recommendation 3. 7. 2: We recommend treating adults with CKD with an SGLT2i for the following (1A): (cid: 3) eGFR 20 ml/min per 1. 73 m2 with urine ACR 200 mg/g (20 mg/mmol), or (cid: 3) heart failure, irrespective of level of albuminuria. Practice Point 3. 7. 3: SGLT2i initiation or use does not necessitate alteration of frequency of CKD monitoring and the reversible decrease in eGFR on initiation is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy. Recommendation 3. 7. 3: We suggest treating adults with eGFR 20 to 45 ml/min per 1. 73 m2 with urine ACR 200 mg/g (20 mg/mmol) with an SGLT2i (2B). 3. 8 Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) TheWorkGrouphighlightsakey recommendation andpracticepointsfromtheKDIGO2022ClinicalPracticeGuidelinefor Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease. 23 Recommendation 3. 8. 1: We suggest a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with proven kidney orcardiovascularbenefitforadultswithT2D, aneGFR25ml/minper1. 73m2, normal serum potassium concentration, and albuminuria (30 mg/g 3 mg/mmol) despite maximum tolerated dose of RAS inhibitor (RASi) (2A).
