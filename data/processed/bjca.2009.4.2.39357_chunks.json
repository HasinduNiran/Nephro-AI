Serum potassium should be measured and potassium dietary intake reduced (such as avoiding potatoes and bananas) if abnormal laboratory values are noted. Dietary phosphate intake should be limited to 8001000 magnesium/day, while calcium intake should not exceed 2000 magnesium. Fluid intake should only be reduced if there is evidence of oedema or fl uid retention (Alderdice and Poulia, 2008). Loop diuretics such as furosemide can assist with sodium excretion from the kidneys and thus prevent sodium retention (Hurst and Th omas, 2008). Engel (2008) identify that when a patient becomes oliguric and ultimately anuric, the intake of salt and fl uid will need to be restricted to control interdialytic weight gain with haemodialysis treatment and fl uid balance with peritoneal dialysis. Th e issue of obesity is important when assessing chronic kidney disease patients. It is important that the diet is low in fat, given the strong association between chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease.
