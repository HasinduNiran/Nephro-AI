Or Evidence of kidney damage, with or without decreased GFR that is present for ≥3 months, as evidenced by the following: Albuminuria Structural abnormalities Haematuria after exclusion (e. g. , on kidney imaging tests) of urological causes Pathological abnormalities (e. g. , kidney biopsy) CKD is generally asymptomatic Up to 90% of kidney function may be lost before symptoms are present, so 1-2 yearly checks for individuals at increased risk are essential. Signs and symptoms of advancing CKD may be general in nature and include: Hypertension Malaise Pruritis Anorexia Nocturia Restless legs Lethargy Haematuria Nausea/vomiting Dyspnoea 11 Targeted detection of CKD Three out of four Australians aged 18 years and over are at increased risk of developing CKD. Detection of CKD should be targeted and focus on people who are known to be at increased risk of developing the condition. The following people are at increased risk of CKD: Diabetes Hypertension Established Family histo ry cardiovascular of kidney failure disease Obesity (body mass Current or past History of acute index ≥30kg/m2 smoker/vaper kidney injury 18 All people aged First Nations Australians 60 years or older aged 18 years or older First Nations Australians experience a higher burden, earlier onset, and faster progression of kidney disease, due to ongoing impacts of colonisation. Clinical tip Individuals at increased risk of developing CKD should be offered a Kidney Health Check (BP, uACR, eGFR) every 1-2 years (annually for First Nations Australians aged ≥18 years, and anyone with diabetes or hypertension). See for information on testing people at risk of CKD. 12 Kidney Health Australia Detecting and diagnosing CKD Early detection of CKD Benefits of early detection Allows for early intervention with treatment approaches and medications that can slow the progression of kidney disease and reduce cardiovascular risk. Facilitates appropriate adjustments to drug dosing, prescribing of medications to slow CKD progression, establishment of a sick day action plan, and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications. Gives patients time to make positive lifestyle changes and appropriately consider treatment options before reaching kidney failure. Has economic benefits for the health system, with every 1 invested leading to 45 of savings in the cost of treating kidney failure and associated CVD. 24 The Kidney Health Check Targeted detection of CKD occurs via Kidney Health Checks for patients at increased risk. The Kidney Health Check involves the following: Blood pressure check Urine test Blood test Consider ambulatory Albumin/creatinine eGFR calculated from blood pressure (ABP) ratio (ACR) to check serum creatinine. monitoring or home BP for albuminuria. monitoring in addition to in-clinic readings.",

To correctly stage CKD, combine the persons kidney function stage (stage 1-5 determined by their eGFR) with their albuminuria stage. This is then plotted on the colour-coded CKD staging table to determine which action plan they should follow.

Healthy dietary patterns are associated with reduced risk of mortality and kidney failure, 37 developing CKD, 38 and progression of CKD39. Consuming adequate fruits (2 serves /day) and vegetables (5 serves / day) can reduce the rate of kidney function decline, decrease body weight and blood pressure, and net acid production to manage metabolic acidosis in CKD. 40 Fluid Make water your drink of choice. There is no recommendation for the number of glasses of water that should be consumed daily for kidney health. It is recommended that people should drink water to satisfy thirst. Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) have shown to elevate the risk and progression of CKD and should be avoided. Salt Salt intake should be reduced to 5 g per day. This may be achieved by adopting strategies, such as: not adding salt in cooking or at the table. choosing packaged foods with 120 mg sodium per 100 g. People with a history of hyperkalaemia should not use salt substitutes and use caution with some reduced salt products, due to them containing high amounts of potassium chloride. Ultra- All people with CKD should avoid ultra-processed foods high processed in fat, sugar, and salt, such as biscuits, cakes, packaged snack foods and foods, takeaway foods, soft drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks, sugar fruit juices and cordials. Individualised diets, tailored to cultural differences, food intolerances, cooking skills, food security, comorbidities (such as diabetes), and cost should be considered when recommending dietary options to patients with CKD and their families. For adults with diabetes and CKD, there is no one specific eating pattern that is superior. Individualised advice is recommended to help optimise glycaemic control. 41 Consider referral to an Accredited Practising Dietitian (APD), especially for help with implementing complex dietary changes, such as potassium restrictions, and if other chronic conditions such as diabetes, are present. 30 Kidney Health Australia Managing CKD in Primary Care Further information and resources Kidney Health Australia Diet and Nutrition resources.

In a primary care setting, it is very likely that individuals will have a CKD diagnosis that sits alongside one or more other chronic conditions.

Hypertension should be considered as part of cardiovascular risk (see ). Hypertension treatment targets Who? Target All people with CKD Maintain blood pressure consistently below 130/80 mmHg Some evidence and clinical guidelines suggest aiming for a lower blood pressure target (systolic BP 120mmHg) in people with CKD who are at high CVD risk may improve outcomes. 72-75 Aiming for a systolic blood pressure of 120 mmHg may be appropriate in certain individuals who are at very high cardiovascular risk. Lower blood pressure targets need to be balanced with an increased risk of side effects including: increased risk of falls due to hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities and episodes of AKI. 52 Kidney Health Australia Managing CKD alongside other chronic conditions Algorithm for management of hypertension in people with CKD Person has CKD Is blood pressure consistently below target (130/80 mmHg)?

System (RAS) Based on many clinical trials demonstrating their inhibitors - e. g. , effectiveness in decreasing proteinuria and delaying CKD ACE inhibitors or progression, the use of RAS inhibitors is recommended as ARBs the first-line pharmacologic strategy for patients with CKD and proteinuria with and without diabetes. They cause a reduction in glomerular blood flow, and GFR can decline when treatment is initiated. Provided the reduction is less than 25% within two weeks of starting therapy, the ACE inhibitor or ARB should be continued. If the reduction in GFR is greater than 25% below the baseline value, the ACE inhibitor or ARB should be ceased, and a referral to a nephrologist considered. In general, combined therapy with ACE inhibitor and ARB is not recommended. Caution should be exercised if baseline potassium is ≥5. 5 mmol/L, as rises in serum potassium of approximately 0. 5 mmol/L are expected (see ). ACE inhibitors or ARBs can be safely prescribed at all stages of CKD and should not be ceased as GFR progressively declines but continued if tolerated. 76 Calcium May be used for people with angina, the elderly and those channel with systolic hypertension. blockers Diuretics (e. g. , Loop diuretics are effective in all stages of CKD including thiazides and when GFR is severely reduced to 30 mL/min/1. 73m2. loop diuretics) Typical doses are 20-120 mg/day, but higher doses (up to 500 mg/day) may be required, especially at lower levels of eGFR.

For use of beta-blockers in heart failure, refer to the National Heart Foundation Australia guidelines. 77 Steroidal MRA Steroidal MRAs may be used for people with concomitant heart failure or hypertension. Use with caution in CKD and in combination with RAS blockade, due to risk of decline in eGFR and hyperkalaemia. Non-steroidal MRAs can be safely used in the setting of type 2 diabetes and CKD. Steroidal and nonsteroidal MRAs should not be prescribed together. For both agents, it is recommended to monitor potassium carefully. Clinical tip ACE inhibitors, ARBs, SGLT2 inhibitors and diuretics should be temporarily discontinued during acute illness, especially in the context of sepsis, hypovolaemia, or hypotension, and recommenced when the condition stabilises.

It is caused by the accumulation of the breakdown products of protein metabolism. The symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and in the advanced stages confusion (encephalopathy), muscle twitching, pericarditis, fluid overload, convulsions, and coma. Although urea and creatinine are the substances measured, the symptoms are most likely due to the accumulation of other unmeasured toxic end products. By the time uraemia becomes symptomatic, dialysis is typically indicated. Management Dialysis should be commenced based on assessment of uraemic symptoms, not eGFR or biochemistry. If non-dialysis pathway is planned, the patient should be reviewed by a specialist kidney supportive care team for assessment of symptoms and nondialysis therapies. These may include dietary modifications, fluid restriction, anti-emetics, and therapy to address pruritus. 71 5 Progressive CKD 72 Kidney Health Australia Indications for referral to a nephrologist32, 110 Appropriate referral is associated with positive outcomes, including: Reduced rate of progression to kidney failure. Decreased morbidity and mortality. Decreased need for and duration of hospitalisation. Increased likelihood of timely preparation of permanent dialysis access prior to dialysis onset. Increased likelihood of kidney transplantation. Tests recommended prior to referral: Current blood chemistry and haematology uACR and urine microscopy for red cell morphology Current and historical blood pressure /- Kidneys Ureters Bladder ultrasound scan Clinical tip Anyone with a rapidly declining eGFR (5 mL/min/1. 73m2 over 3 months) and/or signs of acute nephritis (oliguria, haematuria, acute hypertension, and oedema) should be regarded as a medical emergency and referred without delay.
