It is characterized by the absence of identified causes for chronic kidney disease. The prevalence of CKDu is 15. 122. 9% in some Sri Lankan districts, and previous research has found an association with farming occupations. Methods: A systematic literature review in Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, and Lilacs databases identified 46 eligible peer-reviewed articles and one conference abstract. Results: Geographical mapping indicates a relationship between CKDu and agricultural irrigation water sources. Health mapping studies, human biological studies, and environment-based studies have explored possible causative agents. Most studies focused on likely causative agents related to agricultural practices, geographical distribution based on the prevalence and incidence of CKDu, and contaminants identified in drinking water. Nonetheless, the link between agrochemicals or heavy metals and CKDu remains to be established. No definitive cause for CKDu has been identified. Discussion: Evidence to date suggests that the disease is related to one or more environmental agents, however pinpointing a definite cause for CKDu is challenging. It is plausible that CKDu is multifactorial. No specific guidelines or recommendations exist for treatment of CKDu, and standard management protocols for chronic kidney disease apply. Changes in agricultural practices, provision of safe drinking water, and occupational safety precautions are recommended by the World Health Organization. Keywords: Sri Lanka, chronic kidney disease, CKDu, proteinuria, nephropathy, cadmium Introduction of the world. Environmental agents and conditions, such as Sri Lanka has a population of approximately 20 million and heavy metals and industrial chemicals, have been linked to agriculture is a major component of the economy. 1 Chronic the development of CKDu in other parts of the world. 10, 11 kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) is a major burden on the healthIn this systematic review, we seek to synthesize research care system of Sri Lanka.
