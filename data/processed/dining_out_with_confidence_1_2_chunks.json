Your healthcare provider will tell you the stage of kidney disease, based on how well your kidneys are working and your estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate). The estimated glomerular filtration rate number comes from a lab test that measures the amount of blood your kidneys are filtering each minute. As chronic kidney disease gets worse, the estimated glomerular filtration rate number goes down.

ORG 3 Introduction Most people enjoy eating out. This guide gives ideas for making your dining experience fun. Start by asking your kidney dietitian for any tips or advice. If you have sodium, potassium, phosphorus, protein, or fluid restrictions, this booklet will help you make good decisions. Your specific dietary needs will depend on your level of kidney function and other health conditions. PLAN AHEAD If you will be eating out for dinner, plan breakfast and lunch at home accordingly. Cut back on serving sizes and foods high in sodium and potassium during the day. Moderation is key. Call ahead to learn more 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION about the menu and how the food is prepared. Many restaurants now have websites where they list their menus. Many apps also provide nutrition information. Choose a restaurant where it will be easiest to select foods best suited for you. Restaurants where food is made to order are the best choice. Restaurant staff are used to special food requests or methods of preparation. However, some may require that you call at least 24 hours in advance to make arrangements. MAKING YOUR SELECTIONS Look over the menu carefully. Ask your server for more details about anything you do not understand. Practice making requests about the way your food is prepared or served. Consider sharing a main dish with a friend or family member. EXAMPLES OF SPECIAL REQUESTS For salad dressings, gravies or sauces: on the side. For any grilled, sautéed or baked entrées: No salt, please. For Asian foods: with no MSG (monosodium glutamate). For sandwiches or burgers: without cheese or catsup on the side. PROTEIN CONCERNS Your protein needs will depend on your stage of kidney disease. If your kidney diet includes a protein restriction, you may want to request half portions of main dishes that contain meat, poultry, fish, or cheese. You could share a main dish with a dining companion. Another option is to take part of your main dish home in a takeout box. KIDNEY. ORG 5 Tips Lunch protein portion is usually 4 to 6 ounces Dinner protein portion is usually 6 to 8 ounces Plant-based sources of protein are a healthy choice Dont forget that protein is found in cheese and cream sauces; food prepared with milk, nuts, and eggs; and in plant-based dishes containing dried beans or lentils.",

    "text": "6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Guidelines for Specific Meals or Courses Breakfast: Breakfast may be one of the easiest meals for following your meal plan when you dine out. Most restaurants offer à la carte breakfast items. BREAKFAST Better Choices Poor Choices Eggs, cooked to order Cured or salted meats or fish, such as ham, sausage, lox and Canadian bacon. Limit bacon to 2 strips occasionally. Omelettes with lowOmelets with cheese or above potassium vegetables, such as meats, fast-food breakfast mushroom or squash sandwiches, breakfast burritos Toast, bagels, English muffins, Biscuits and bran muffins croissants, plain or blueberry muffins French toast Home fries or hash brown potatoes Margarine, jelly, honey, Real maple syrup or gravy cinnamon, sugar, and imitation pancake syrup Fruits and juices (1/2 cup), Fruits and juices, such as such as applesauce, apple orange juice or a grapefruit juice, berries, and pineapple half Hot and cold cereals Bran cereals and granola with nuts, seeds, or wheat germ Donuts, fruit pastry, sweet Pastries containing chocolate, rolls, coffee cake nuts, coconut, or caramel Tip If you have a fluid restriction save your fluid throughout the day to allow more when you eat out. KIDNEY. ORG 7 Beverages: Choose beverages low in potassium and phosphorus. (Ask your kidney dietitian for specific guidelines. ) If you need to restrict fluids: Plan the amount of fluid you may have during the meal. Plan when you want the beverage: before, during, or after the meal. Decline offers at other times. Request that your glass or cup not be refilled. Order beverages by the glass instead of ordering a pitcher of drinks. Squeeze lemon wedges into your water to help quench your thirst. Turn cups or glasses upside down before they are filled or ask to have them removed. Push your glass or cup away from your plate when you are finished to avoid refills. 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION BEVERAGES Better Choices Poor Choices Non-cola soft drinks, such as Any cola Sprite, 7UP, or orange soda Iced tea or coffee Cocoa, milk, milk shakes, cocoa mixes Lemonade, limeade, water Orange juice-type drinks, tomato juice, vegetable juice Cocktails mixed with club Cocktails mixed with fruit soda, ginger ale, tonic water, juice, tomato juice, vegetable or soft drinks (except colas) cocktail, milk, cream, or ice cream Wine, red or white Beer Avoid beverages with phosphate additives. Salads and Salad Bars: Salads are often part of the appetizer list. Use your allowed fruits and vegetables for these choices. Request that the dressing be served on the side so you can control the amount you eat. Oil and vinegar is always a good choice for dressing. You may bring your own low-sodium dressing. Lemon or lime juice squeezed generously over the salad can replace salad dressing altogether. If they are not listed on the menu, ask the server which vegetables or fruits are in the salad. Often salads are prepared individually, so you can usually make special requests. Some examples are listed on the following chart. KIDNEY.",

If you need to limit protein, a high-protein appetizer can be used as your main course. Portions are usually smaller and less expensive. Some examples are listed on the following chart and will vary with the type of restaurant. Use nutrition apps to learn sodium content of food. APPETIZERS Better Choices Poor Choices Garden salads with thin Cottage cheese, cheese fondue, dressing and chicken or shrimp other cheese dishes, anchovies Chicken, pork, or steak tostadas Quiche, cheese sticks Crab cakes, steamed clams, Oysters fried calamari, most shrimp dishes Crab Louis salad Nachos, potato skins Green salad with meat or fish, Chopped liver or pâté; salted or chefs salad without ham or or smoked meat, fish, or cheese (request dressing on poultry, such as ham, lox or the side) smoked turkey; soup, bouillon, or consommé Others: meat balls, chicken wings, pot stickers and dumplings (without dipping sauces) KIDNEY. ORG 11 LOW-PROTEIN APPETIZERS Better Choices Poor Choices Garden salad with thin dressing Caesar dressing with raw egg Fried zucchini, mushrooms, or Salted chips onion rings Fresh fruit such as berries Melon 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Entrées: Portions served in restaurants may be much larger than what you eat at home. When dining out, estimate an amount close to what you normally have. Plan to take the remainder home, or split the meal with another person in your group. Tip Three ounces of cooked meat, fish, or poultry is about the size of a deck of cards. Or, if you weigh meat portions at home, measure them against your hand to use as a guide when eating away from home, Grilled items are good choices because you can request how you want them prepared. Request that salt not be added when cooking (use apps to determine sodium content if the restaurant does not prepare food on site). Request that gravies or sauces be served on the side. Avoid mixed dishes or casseroles, which are usually higher in sodium and phosphorus. Remove the skin from poultry and any crusts from fried foods to decrease sodium content. It is best NOT to add steak sauce, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, or hot sauce because of the high sodium content. Lemon or lime juice and vinegar make good sauces and will bring out a lot of the natural flavor of foods. Black pepper will add zest to the food without making you thirsty. KIDNEY.",

Use lettuce, fresh tomato slice, peppers, and onions for condiments. Limit use of sauces, mustard, and catsup. Side Dishes: Knowing your kidney diet when eating out will make it easier to choose appropriate foods. Eating out more than 3 times a week will make it difficult to limit sodium. Choose healthy grains and vegetables such as rice, noodles, and green beans (without added salt and sauces). 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Mashed potatoes are lower in potassium than baked potatoes. If your meal does not include a good choice for your diet, request a substitute on the menu. Ask that sauces be omitted or served on the side. Tip If you need to restrict potassium, avoid higherpotassium fruits and vegetables during the day before eating out. KIDNEY.

High-sodium vegetables like sauerkraut, pickled vegetables Tip It you are on a phosphate binder (also called a phosphorus binder) remember to take them with your meal. Carry it with you and keep some in the car so it is always easily available. 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Desserts: Ask for a clear description of the dessert. Choose desserts that have few ingredients to avoid hidden phosphorus and potassium. Choices with chocolate, cream cheese, ice cream, or nuts will be much higher in potassium and phosphorus. Avoid these, share with a friend, or just eat a small amount. If you need to restrict fluids, desserts such as fruit ice, gelatin, sorbet, and sherbet add to your fluid intake for the day. Sweets may or may not be desirable for you. Always follow the advice of your dietitian, who is more familiar with your individual needs.",

ORG 17 Specialized or Ethnic Restaurants: An enjoyable aspect of eating out is trying different ethnic and regional foods. Follow these suggestions for making wise choices. CHINESE Caution: May be very high in sodium. Request no MSG (monosodium glutamate), soy or fish sauce in food preparation. (The menu may include this information. ) Avoid restaurants that cook in bulk; look for those that prepare foods individually. You may call in advance to get this information. Avoid adding soy sauce to the food after it is served. Most Chinese restaurants will provide a hot pepper oil. This can be added to make the food spicier, if desired. Soups served with the meal are usually high in sodium and may add undesired fluid weight. Choose lower-potassium vegetables, such as snow peas, string beans, water chestnuts, bean sprouts, and bok choy. Request stir-fried vegetables that are not served in heavy sauces. 18 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Steamed rice is more authentic and has less sodium than fried rice. The tea is often served in a pot on the table. If you need to restrict fluids, control the amount poured into your cup to help control your fluid weight gain. Enjoy your fortune cookie knowing you have made the best choices. FRENCH Caution: May be very high in phosphorus. French restaurants usually use fresh ingredients, but cream and butter may be added in large amounts. Try to avoid those foods prepared in cheese or cream sauces. Careful questioning of the server can help you make your decision. Choose low-potassium fruits and vegetables, and avoid high-potassium fried potatoes (pommes frites). KIDNEY. ORG 19 French bread is a good choice, low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. The butter served is usually sweet or unsalted. Select a simple, light vinaigrette for salad dressing. Desserts are always a highlight. Look for sorbets (count as fluid), cakes, meringues, or fruits, such as plums, berries or cherries, that are not covered in heavy cream sauces or chocolate. MEXICAN Caution: May be very high in potassium. Put aside the salted chips and salsa that might be at the table when you first sit down. Ask for unsalted chips and a small bowl of fresh pico de gallo for less sodium and potassium. Order à la carte. Some good items are tacos, tostadas, and fajitas. Beware of the salsas and limit to 1 to 2 tablespoons daily. Salsa verde is a green sauce but is made of green tomatoes. Salsas made of chili peppers without tomatoes added are the best choices. Remember, guacamole is made from avocados, which are very high in potassium. Corn or homemade flour tortillas are good bread substitutes. Enjoy them! 20 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION For dessert, try the sopapillas (fried dough) with honey, which are a good choice because they are low in potassium and phosphorus.",

    "text": "Pastries are high in saturated fat, however, so make sure to eat them in moderate portions. Ask for less cheese. ASIAN INDIAN Caution: May be very high in phosphorus. Indian meals are often vegetarian. Beans may be appropriate to eat in place of meat. Ask your kidney dietitian about portion sizes. Enjoy experimenting with different flavors. Masala, tandoori, and curry preparations are widely available on menus as both chicken and vegetable entrées. Remember to ask which vegetables are included in dishes. Make low potassium choices if your blood potassium level is too high. Yogurt is often served as a side dish or as part of side dishes, but remember it is a dairy food and high in phosphorus. A large selection of Indian breads, fried, baked, or roasted, are served with most meals or are available as separate orders. Most desserts contain milk or milk powder in the recipe and will be high in phosphorus. Remember to take your phosphate binders if prescribed. KIDNEY. ORG 21 ITALIAN Caution: May be very high in potassium. Beware of antipasto appetizers that contain salty sausages and pickled or marinated vegetables. These foods could get your meal off to a salty, high-fat start. Also, pass on minestrone soup, which is high in salt and potassium. Request an oil and vinegar dressing for salad. Italian bread is a good choice. Dipping bread in olive oil is a healthy alternative to spreading butter on it. Olive oil contains heart-healthy fats, not the large amount of animal fat in butter. Tomato sauces are poor choices, but pastas are served with many sauces that are not tomato based. If you do select one with tomato sauce, request that it be served on the side. Limit cheese and white sauces. If you choose pizza, look for a light or vegetarian topping, and request that the tomato sauce and cheese be used lightly. It is best to avoid pepperoni or sausage pizzas, which are high in sodium. Other available toppings may include chicken or fish, both good choices. Pesto or garlic oil are good examples of pasta sauces that are low in potassium. One tablespoon of shredded Parmesan or Romano cheese may be used for flavor. Pepper flakes may be used liberally. Italian ices are good dessert choices, but remember to count them as fluid. 22 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION JAPANESE Caution: May be very high in sodium. Avoid the salty soups, like miso, served at the beginning of the meal. Request no MSG (monosodium glutamate) and avoid soy sauce. Sushi can be a good choice, because portions are small. Avoid raw fish choices because they may expose you to parasitic infections. Other rolls include cucumbers and cooked shrimp, crab, or eel. Avoid raw and undercooked foods if you have a kidney transplant. Try the yakitori, or food grilled on skewers over a charcoal fire. Foods fried in tempura batter are good choices if not dipped in highsodium sauces. Tofu, or soybean curd, is used regularly in Japanese cooking. It is substituted for meat in the kidney diet. Be aware that it is often cooked with soy sauce for added flavor. Japanese steak houses offer good choices of grilled meat and vegetables, but portions may be large. Limit portion size of meat if you need to restrict protein. KIDNEY. ORG 23 SOUL FOOD Caution: May be high in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. Soul food is very challenging to the kidney diet because it is frequently high in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus, as well as fat. Salted and cured meats, such as ham, sausages, bacon, and salt pork should be avoided.",

Organ meats, such as chitterlings, are higher in phosphorus than cuts of muscle meat. Limit these to occasional use. Dried beans and black-eyed peas are high in phosphorus and potassium. Limit these to small amounts (12 tablespoons). Cooked greens and spinach are popular. Both are high potassium vegetables. Mustard greens are slightly lower in potassium. Yams and sweet potato pie are high in potassium. Best meal choices might include fried chicken (with skin removed), corn, string beans or okra, wilted lettuce, corn bread, butter, and banana cake, apple cake or peach cobbler for dessert. Enjoy, and dont forget your phosphate binders. 24 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Fast Foods: Eating at fast-food restaurants is not totally out of the question. It does, however, take some thought and planning. While many fast-food items are pre-salted, there may be some items that are prepared without salt. You can also avoid high-sodium condiments, such as BBQ or soy sauce, and limit others, such as catsup, to one package. Many fast-food restaurants provide nutrition information, so you can check the sodium and potassium content. Your dietitian can also provide this information and tell you the specific amounts of sodium and potassium allowed in your diet.
