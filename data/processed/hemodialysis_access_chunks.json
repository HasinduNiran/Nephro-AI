ORG 3 Introduction Whether you are already on hemodialysis treatment or you will soon be starting dialysis, this booklet will help you better understand the ways hemodialysis machines reach (access) your blood for filtering. Some of the covered topics include: Choosing the best access for you Pros and cons of different access types Your access is important for best results from hemodialysis treatment Access care Maintaining your access 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION What is a hemodialysis access? A hemodialysis access, sometimes called a vascular access, is an opening made in your skin and blood vessel during a short surgical procedure. When you have dialysis, your blood flows out of the access through soft tubes and into a hemodialysis machine. After your blood is filtered in the machine, it goes through a soft tube to the access and back into your body. Are different types of access available? Yes, there are three types of accesses that are used for hemodialysis. Your doctor should teach you about the pros and cons of each one. Your doctor should refer you to a special surgeon with hemodialysis access experience at least six months before you need to start treatment. A surgeon can evaluate you and help you choose the type of access that is best for you. When your doctor tells you that you will need dialysis in the near future, you should protect the arm where the surgery will be done. Dont allow anyone to draw blood or give you an injection in this arm. Also, never let anyone use a cuff to take your blood pressure from this arm. You should wear a medical alert bracelet to inform hospital staff about your arm. KIDNEY. ORG 5 AV FISTULA Vein (V) Artery (A) AV Fistula An AV (artery-vein) fistula is the best choice for hemodialysis. It is preferred because it: Usually lasts longer Has fewer problems like clotting and infections A fistula should be placed several months before you need to start dialysis. This allows the fistula enough time to fully heal before starting dialysis. Minor surgery is needed to create the fistula. It is made by connecting a vein to a nearby artery, usually in your arm. This creates a large blood vessel that has a fast flow of blood. Your lower forearm (between the wrist and elbow) is the preferred location for your fistula. A fistula usually takes one to four months to mature, which means the vein becomes larger due to increased blood flow. Once the access has matured, dialysis treatments can start. Ask your healthcare provider when you can start doing exercises, such as squeezing a rubber ball, to help your fistula mature Fistulas usually last for many years. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION AV GRAFT Vein Artery An AV (artery-vein) graft is usually the second choice for an access.",

Minor surgery is done using an artificial tube between a vein and a nearby artery. The AV graft generally needs to be in place at least two weeks after surgery before they can be used. CATHETER A catheter is most often used for a temporary access. For example, it is sometimes used for a short time in people who get an AV fistula and need to fully healed before it can be used. KIDNEY. ORG 7 Sometimes a catheter is used over a long period of time because a fistula or graft is not possible. Catheters are made of soft plastic tubing. There are two parts, one for removing your blood and the other for returning the cleaned blood to your body. A catheter is typically placed only when you need to start dialysis immediately. It is put in a large vein, usually in your neck but sometimes in your upper chest. Catheters have more problems (like clotting and infections) than fistulas or grafts. They may not allow for enough blood flow for good dialysis treatment. 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Pros and Cons of different access types AV Fistula Pros and Cons PROS: Lasts longer Not prone to infection Provides excellent blood flow once it is ready to use Less likely to develop blood clots and become blocked You can take showers once the access heals after surgery CONS: Needs to mature, which takes one to four months, before it can be used Needles are used to connect to the dialysis machine KIDNEY. ORG 9 AV Graft Pros and Cons PROS: Provides excellent blood flow once it is ready to use You can take showers once the access heals after surgery CONS: Does not last as long as an AV fistula More prone to infection than an AV fistula Needs at least two weeks before it can be used Clotting can be a problem that may require surgery or other treatment to correct Needles are used to connect to the dialysis machine 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Catheter Pros and Cons PROS: Can be used right away No needles are needed to connect to the machine. CONS: Usually a temporary access Most prone to infection May not have enough blood flow for best dialysis results Blood clots can form that block blood flow through the catheter Can cause narrowing of major blood vessels Check with your care team to see if showering is an permitted KIDNEY.",

ORG 13 What happens when I start dialysis? If you have an AV fistula or AV graft, two needles are inserted into your access at the beginning of each dialysis. These needles are connected to soft plastic tubes that go into the dialysis machine. Your blood goes into the machine through one of the tubes. The blood passes through the dialyzer (artificial kidney), where it is filtered (cleaned). It is returned to you through the other tube. If you have a catheter, it can be connected directly to the dialysis tubes, and no needles are used. 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION What happens if my access is not working well? If your access is not working well, it can decrease the amount of dialysis you get. Getting enough dialysis is important to: Improve your overall health Help you live longer Improve your quality of life Keep you out of the hospital To make sure you are getting the right amount of filtering, your care team will measure your delivered dose of dialysis. This tells them if enough fluids and waste products are being removed from your blood. Your delivered dose of dialysis will be checked by doing a blood test to measure your Kt/V (pronounced kay tee over vee).",

How are they treated? Sometimes, even when you take the best care of your access, you may have problems. If an infection occurs, your doctor will order antibiotics for you. If your access develops a clot, it needs to be treated with special medications. Sometimes this medication can be given in the dialysis unit. Other times, you may need to go to the hospital for treatment. Sometimes surgery is needed to remove a clot or repair an access. Angioplasty may be needed to widen a narrowed fistula or graft. Your dialysis care team will check your access for problems. You, too, can help spot possible problems. Learn the warning signs listed on pages 20-21. Contact your doctor or dialysis center right away if you notice any of them. KIDNEY. ORG 19 Warning signs of access problems INFECTION Warning signs: Redness, swelling, soreness, and/or a feeling of warmth around your access site; fever, chills, and/or achy feeling. Steps to take: Call your doctor or dialysis care team at once. Youll need to take antibiotic medicine prescribed by your doctor. CLOTTING OR POOR BLOOD FLOW IN YOUR ACCESS Warning signs: Absence of the vibration (thrill) or sound (bruit) at your fistula or graft site; swelling of your arm; lower skin temperature around the access site; a decrease in your delivered dose of dialysis (Kt/V or URR); or changes in other lab values. 20 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Steps to take: Call your doctor or dialysis center. Keep a record of your Kt/V or URR and other labs. Speak to your dialysis care team when there are changes.

ORG 21 Summary Key points to remember Keeping your access working well will help you get the most from hemodialysis and help you feel your best. If your access is not working well, it can decrease the amount of dialysis you receive, which may affect your overall health and how long you live on dialysis. A fistula is the preferred type of access. If you are already receiving hemodialysis and you do not have a fistula, ask your doctor or dialysis care team if you are a candidate for a fistula. Make sure your dialysis care team checks your access often. They should do some special tests to make sure it is working well. 22 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Do not let anyone measure your blood pressure on your access arm, or take blood from your access arm when you are not getting dialysis. Your other arm should be used to measure blood pressure and do blood tests. Ask your dialysis care team to teach you the steps for good access care to prevent infection and keep your access working well. Know the warning signs for problems with your access. Track your important test results, such as your Kt/V and your URR. Ask your dialysis care team if you have any questions about your access or any other aspects of your hemodialysis care. KIDNEY.
