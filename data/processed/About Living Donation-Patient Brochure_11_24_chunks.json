ORG 3 About Living Donation What is living kidney donation? Living donation is when a living person donates an organ (or part of an organ) to another person. A healthy person who has two kidneys can donate one to someone in need. A living donor may donate to someone they know, like a family member, friend, or spouse, or a stranger who theyve never met. A potential donor is someone who is thinking about donating. A recipient is someone with kidney failure who needs a kidney transplant. Who can be a living kidney donor? To donate a kidney, the person must be in good physical and mental health. Living donors must be at least 18 years old to donate at a transplant center in the United States. Some centers require a donor to be 21 or even a little older. There are some medical conditions that could prevent someone from being a living donor, including having uncontrolled high blood pressure or cancer. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION KIDNEY.

The surgeon will also talk about pain management medicine for a short period after surgery. If the donation goes ahead, the surgeon will visit the donor a few times in the hospital after surgery. Dietitian The dietician will review daily eating habits and talk about life after donation. Even though living donors dont have to change their diet after donating, the dietician will review what a healthy, well-balanced diet looks like, to help donors take proper care of their body before and after donating. Independent Living Donor Advocate An Independent Living Donor Advocate (also known as an ILDA) is a care team member who is totally separate from the living donor team. Every living donor meets with an ILDA during the evaluation to talk about their reasons for wanting to donate.

Most donors stay in the hospital one to two nights after surgery. Most donors are fully recovered after four to six weeks. Some donors return to work two weeks after surgery if they dont have a very physical job.
