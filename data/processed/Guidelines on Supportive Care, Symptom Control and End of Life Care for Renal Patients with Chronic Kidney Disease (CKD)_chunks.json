Symptom control is complicated by delayed drug clearance, dialysis effects and care is needed with some drugs that have high renal toxicity eg NSAIDs. Whilst some patients are offered and accept renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplant), other patients will decide not to undergo treatment and will instead opt for conservative management. In these guidelines we aim to provide information on chronic kidney disease and the management of common symptoms associated with it. The final section provides guidance on end of life care. What is Chronic Kidney Disease? chronic kidney disease means that both kidneys have been damaged irreversibly. The chemical waste products and toxins that are normally removed by the kidneys build up in the blood causing the symptoms of kidney failure. Chronic Kidney Disease (chronic kidney disease) chronic kidney disease stage 1 Normal renal function chronic kidney disease stage 2 Mild impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate 60-89 Asymptomatic milliliters per minute) chronic kidney disease stage 3a Moderate impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate 45 - Asymptomatic 59 milliliters per minute) chronic kidney disease stage 3b Moderate impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate 30Anaemia, fatigue, muscle 44 milliliters per minute) cramps chronic kidney disease stage 4 Severe impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate 15-29 In addition: anorexia, nausea, milliliters per minute) insomnia, neuropathy, gout chronic kidney disease stage 5 End stage renal disease In addition: itch, headache, (estimated glomerular filtration rate 15 milliliters per minute) cognitive impairment; death At chronic kidney disease stage 5, renal replacement therapy (RRT) is required to relieve symptoms and to preserve life. However, for many, due to the limitations of transplantation, the only available modality is dialysis, which is demanding and time-consuming and it is often necessary for the patient to make lasting lifestyle changes, including modification to diet and fluid intake. Haemodialysis is usually started at Southmead Hospital and then transferred to a satellite unit nearer home for treatment three times per week. Understandably, this can be a physical and psychological burden to both patient and carers. Dialysis treatment only replaces some functions of the kidney. It cannot reverse the effects of the patients other co-morbid conditions and in some cases may not improve the patients quality of life. In such situations it is important for all concerned to have a clear view of the likely advantages and disadvantages of undertaking dialysis treatment and this usually involves a good deal of discussion over a period of time between the patient, their relatives and carers and the renal team at Southmead. If dialysis is not started, patients are managed conservatively.",

    "text": "If dialysis is not started, patients are managed conservatively. 2 Supportive Care Supportive care for renal patients recognises that: Some patients may not benefit from dialysis, particularly those 75 years old with multiple co-morbidities Some patients may choose not to have dialysis Some patients may choose to stop dialysis and it is important to establish their wishes about future care, particularly their preferences for place of death These patients should be on the GP practice supportive care register They may be well and relatively symptom free, but evidence shows that once their function starts to decline, they deteriorate rapidly As stated in the Renal NSF a no-dialysis option is not a no treatment option. The patient and their family will receive continued support from the renal multidisciplinary team working in conjunction with GP and district nurses, with targeted input from social workers, occupational therapists and specialist palliative care. The patient will have active symptom management including treatment of anaemia with erythropoietin and optimal management of comorbid conditions to improve quality of life. Recognising poor prognosis and end of life information sharing The symptoms associated with chronic kidney disease vary. Symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, anorexia, insomnia, anxiety, depression and lethargy with decreasing performance status may be present for months. Severe symptoms usually only arise within the last two weeks of life. Introducing palliative care at an early stage for those patients who have chosen not to have dialysis can result in better symptom control and can help the transition into end of life care. Discussion early in the course of disease about a persons wishes for end of life care should aid in decision making and should be recorded to help all those involved in the patients care know what the wishes are for an individual. (link to ACP documents) In the BNSSG area, there are electronic registers available for recording important end of life information, so that it can be accessed by professionals in both the acute and community setting, by ambulance crews and by Out of Hours staff. A patient must give consent prior to entry of their data onto the system. Ongoing support from the renal team Patients whose chronic kidney disease is being managed without dialysis or transplantation will usually remain under the care of a renal physician via outpatient clinics and liaison with their general practitioner and district nurse team. In complex situations, joint home visits may be undertaken.

End of Life artery disease, osteoporosis, (hyperlink) osteoarthritis 6 Dialysis-headache, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal cramps, restless legs, fistula problems, calciphylaxis Other pathology-myeloma, other malignancy The origin of the pain may be neuropathic, musculoskeletal or ischaemic. General Principles of Pain Management Assess pain fully before treatment. Use WHO ladder on next page to titrate analgesia according to response. Avoid codeine, morphine, oxycodone and diamorphine as they have active metabolites that are renally excreted. Use adjuvant analgesics as needed at any step as indicated by type of pain. NSAIDs should not be used in patients who are not being dialysed as they may actively worsen renal function. If this is the only route to achieving good symptom control, discuss with one of the renal physicians and ensure that patient and carers are aware of the potential harm. Oral route is first choice if available. Seek advice if: Severe pain Pain not coming under control despite careful titration Dose of opioid is escalating rapidly Patient showing signs of opioid toxicity Patient is having episodes of acute severe pain You are not sure of the underlying cause of the pain Pain is worse on movement 7 14a Pain Management in Renal Disease-WHO Analgesic Ladder Modified for chronic kidney disease STEP 1: Mild Pain Paracetamol 1g qds /- adjuvant analgesic If pain persists, proceed to Step 2 STEP 2: Mild to Moderate Pain Paracetamol 1g qds Tramadol up to 50mg bd max /- adjuvant analgesic If pain persists, proceed to Step 3 STEP 3: Moderate to Severe Pain Paracetamol 1g qds opioid for moderate to severe pain /- adjuvant analgesic The opioids of choice in chronic kidney disease are: Oral route: Hydromorphone Normal release (NR) or Modified release (MR) (Hydromorphone 1. 3mg is equivalent to Morphine 10mg) Transdermal route: Fentanyl patches (25microgram/hour patch equivalent to Morphine 90mg) Subcutaneous route: Fentanyl Intermittent Prescribe Hydromorphone NR 1. 3mg po up to hourly. Pain If 3 or more doses needed per 24 hours or patient still in pain, consider giving regularly as for continuous pain. If oral route not available, see End of Life/Pain for guidance with sc Fentanyl. Continuous Prescribe Hydromorphone NR 1. 3mg po 4-6 hourly and 1. 3mg for as needed use. If pain Pain controlled (less than 2 as needed doses), leave for another 24 hours and then convert to Hydromorphone MR 4mg bd or Fentanyl patch (see below). If pain not controlled (3 or more as needed doses), increase 4-6 hourly doses to Hydromorphone NR 2. 6mg plus as needed. Review at least every 24 hours and titrate further according to response until pain stable. Watch for signs of toxicity (myoclonus, drowsiness) especially if not dialysing. Once pain is stable, convert to Hydromorphone MR or a Fentanyl patch. Eg: If pain is stable on Hydromorphone NR 1. 3mg 4-6 hrly, this is equivalent to a Fentanyl 12microgram/heart rate patch. Apply patch to clean, dry skin at 0900. It takes 12 hours for the patch to become effective, so continue with Hydromorphone 1. 3mg at 6 hourly intervals until patient goes to bed. Then instruct them to stop taking regular Hydromorphone and leave the Fentanyl patch on, which will then need to be changed every 72 hours. Fentanyl is well tolerated, has no active renally excreted metabolites and is not removed by dialysis. Patients should be warned that with fever or if they soak in a hot bath, absorption can be dangerously increased.",

End of Life Care General Principles of End of Life Care Assessment Use these guidelines when the whole team, the patient and their carers agree that the patient is in the last days of life. It is intended as a guide and does not replace the professional judgment that should be exercised according to the clinical situation. Diagnosis of the terminal phase can be difficult. Ensure that there are no appropriately reversible causes of deterioration such as hypercalcaemia, infection or opioid toxicity. Rapid functional decline often heralds the end of life and includes: Poor tolerance of renal replacement therapy Patient becoming bed bound and increasingly drowsy /- confusion Patient only able to take sips of fluid / difficulty swallowing tablets Survival after withdrawal of renal dialysis is usually about 7-10 days, but a few patients have residual renal function and may live up to 6 weeks. Aims of Treatment The aim of treatment is the comfort of the patient and the support of those close to them. Management Ensure that you have considered the following questions: Do the patient, carers and health professional recognise that the end of life is close? Discuss prognosis, goals of care and preferred place of death if possible with patient and family Clarify resuscitation status With patient consent, enter end of life information and limits of treatment escalation on electronic patient record, so that it is available for out of hours teams and ambulance service. Have all unnecessary investigations, including blood tests and routine monitoring such as blood pressure, been discontinued? Have all non-palliative medications been discontinued? Note: Some patients still benefit from oral diuretics, adjuvant analgesics, bicarbonate and if they can still manage oral medications, these can be continued Is comfort care, particularly care of mouth, pressure areas and itchy skin in place? Anticipatory Prescribing Are the drugs needed for palliation prescribed by route appropriate for the patients situation and are they available as needed? All patients should have as needed medication prescribed and available for pain, agitation, respiratory tract secretions, nausea and vomiting and breathlessness.
