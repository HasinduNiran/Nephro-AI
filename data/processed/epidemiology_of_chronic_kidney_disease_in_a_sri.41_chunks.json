Sheriff2 University Medical Unit1, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Department of Clinical Medicine2, Faculty of Medicine, Colombo, Sri Lanka ABSTRACT. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing problem in Sri Lanka. Diabetes and hypertension are the main contributors to the disease burden. A new form of CKD of uncertain etiology (CKD-u) is the predominant form of CKD in certain parts of Sri Lanka, threatening to reach epidemic proportions. A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out over a three-month period at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka to identify the underlying etiologic factors for the disease in a cohort of patients with CKD. A total of 200 patients were studied with a mean age of 50. 57 years. Of them, 108 (54%) were in CKD stage V. Majority of the patients were from the western province (137, 68. 5%) with only five (2. 5%) from provinces with high prevalence of CKD-u. The most common underlying causes of CKD were diabetes (88, 44%) and hypertension (34, 17%). However, in patients younger than 40 years of age the most common cause was glomerulonephritis (20, 42. 6%). Diabetes was the most common cause of CKD among patients from the western province (74, 54%). The prevalence of CKD-u was twice as high in patients from areas outside the western province compared with patients from this province (P 0. 05). The low prevalence of CKD-u in the study population could be the result of poor representation of patients from provinces with high prevalence of CKD-u. Introduction stage renal disease (ESRD), there are more than 200 with overt CKD (stage III or IV) and Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is fast becoalmost 5000 with covert disease (stage I or II). 2 ming a global epidemic. 1 Data from the United Unfortunately, such data are not available for States suggest that for every patient with endmost of the developing countries, including Sri Correspondence to: Lanka.

CKD of uncertain or unknown etiology is an entity described in certain provinces of Sri Lanka. The geographic distribution of CKD-u appears to be based toward the northern regions of the country in which the north central, part of north western, and part of Uva provinces are included. The population at risk are scattered in the north central region with high prevalence observed at Medawachchiya, Padaviya, Dehiattakandiya, Girandurukotte, Medirigiriya and recently Nikawewa (Figure 1). This entity was discovered when several studies failed to identify a specific cause for CKD in the vast majority of the patients from these areas.
