The high CKD burden in this region is predominantly driven by an increased prevalence of risk factors including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and use of traditional medicines and is further aggravated by challenges associated with effective implementation of population-based screening and surveillance systems in early detection and intervention of CKD. The Asian continent mostly comprised of lowand middle-income countries with resource restraints lacks robust population-based CKD registries resulting in a paucity of data on CKD incidence and prevalence, various treatment modalities, uptake of current guidelines, and the overall impact of implementation of developmental programs. There is an urgent need for a collaborative action plan between the healthcare community and governments in this region to detect CKD in its early stages and prevent its complications including kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and death. Research-based evidence on the impact of early detection, sustainable treatment options, quality of life, delay or avoidance of dialysis, and related cost analysis is the need of the hour. We highlight successful implementation of strategic and policy-sharing programs adopted in a few countries; also, consolidate available region-specific data, quantify estimates of CKD burden and propose strategies with a multidisciplinary approach involving patients, the healthcare community and governmental bodies to combat CKD and its complications.

The change in the burden of Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam, was convened to review CKD from 1990 to 2016 in terms of incidence, prevalence, the regional burden, evaluate the role of risk factors on death, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) showed incidence and progression of CKD, and the unmet needs an alarming rise with CKD incidence increasing by 89%, and challenges unique to Asia. The committee aimed to prevalence by 87%, death due to CKD by 98%, and DALYs outline region-specific guidance strategies in the early by 62% 8.

Developmental programs and initiatives for CKD screening Country Developmental programs Taiwan The national kidney care program has resulted in improved clinical outcomes along with a reduction in health care system costs. The Department of Health made CKD prevention and care a major public health priority and an integrated CKD care program was initiated to promote the screening of high-risk populations, patient education, and multidisciplinary team care. Nephrotoxic Chinese herbs containing aristolochic acid were prohibited through public health legislation in 2003. National pay-for-performance programs for CKD were implemented as part of health care improvement projects, along with diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease care in 2006 (pre-ESKD program) and 2011 (early CKD program) 119. The Taiwan model has been proposed for adoption by the Indonesian Ministry of Health as well. Republic of Korea The Korean National Health Screening Program for CKD was implemented in 2002 with biannual screening starting at the age of 40 years for CKD by proteinuria (dipstick) and eGFR testing. Korean organ transplantation policies have ensured an increase in the availability of donor transplants, the Korean Society for Transplantation established a webbased registry, the Korean Organ Transplantation Registry to educate patients, donor families, and healthcare professionals. Philippines The Philippines national insurance covers kidney transplantation as a single largest payment for any surgical procedure. Thailand The Chronic Kidney Disease Prevention in the Northeast Thailand (CKDNET) is an initiative to reduce the CKD burden in the region. Pamphlets, posters, brochures, and other media are distributed for CKD education and awareness at the community level. Locally suitable practice guidelines have been formulated 120. Hong Kong The Screening for Hong Kong Asymptomatic Renal Population and Evaluation (SHARE) program is an effective screening program at the primary care level that identified potential subjects for further evaluation and aided in educating the public about the significance of following up even asymptomatic renal diseases 121. Singapore The HALT-CKD program was started in 2017, the Holistic Approach in Lowering and Tracking Chronic Kidney Disease (HALT-CKD) program concentrates on a concerted effort for timely detection and delaying the progression of CKD in primary care settings through an integrated and multi-faceted approach. The program focuses on a series of lifestyle modifications (low-salt diet, physical activity, smoking cessation) and medical interventions such as optimization of RAASi, MRA, and SGLT2i government has also authorized subsidies and reimbursements to reduce the financial burden in CKD patients 122. Malaysia Under the Strategic Action Plan for Healthy Kidneys (ACT-KID) 2018-2025 there are various initiatives utilizing multisectoral collaborations to promote public and healthcare practitioner awareness of CKD which emphasize the need for screening and early detection, as well as guideline-directed CKD management 123. Indonesia The government NHIS launched a noncommunicable and chronic disease management program named Indonesian Chronic Disease Management Program (PROLANIS) in 2014 with T2DM and hypertension as the main focus.",

Indications requiring referral to kidney specialists. Referral indications based on CKD staging and specific conditions warranting comprehensive evaluation and management are elaborated. These indications emphasize the importance of specialized assessment and intervention by kidney specialists to optimize patient care and outcomes in CKD management. Albuminuria and proteinuria can be measured using excretion rates in timed urine collections, the ratio of concentrations to creatinine concentration in spot urine samples, and using reagent strips in spot urine samples. Relationships among measurement methods within a category are not exact. For example, the relationships between AER and ACR and between PER and PCR are based on the assumption that average creatinine excretion rate is approximately 1. 0 g/day or 10 mmol/day. The conversions are rounded for pragmatic reasons (for an exact conversion from mg/g of creatinine to mg/mmol of creatinine, multiply by 0. 113). Creatinine excretion varies with age, sex, race, and diet; therefore, the relationship among these categories is approximate only. ACR 10 mg/g (1 mg/mmol) is considered normal; ACR 1030 mg/g (13 mg/mmol) is considered high normal. ACR 2, 200 mg/g (220 mg/mmol) is considered nephrotic range.",
