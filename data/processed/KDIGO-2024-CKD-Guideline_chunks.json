In all cases, a first void in the morning midstream sample is preferred in adults and children. (i) urine albumin-creatinine ratio, or (ii) reagent strip urinalysis for albumin and albumin-creatinine ratio with automated reading.

Practice Point 1. 3. 1. 2: Use more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected using less accurate methods.

Key recommendations and practice points are highlighted: Recommendation 3. 6. 1: We recommend starting renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (RASi) (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker angiotensin receptor blocker) for people with chronic kidney disease and severely increased albuminuria (G1G4, A3) without diabetes (1B).

S158 KidneyInternational(2024)105(Suppl4S), S117S314 www. kidney-international. org summary of recommendation statements and practice points Practice Point 3. 6. 1: RASi (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker) should be administered using the highest approved dose that is tolerated to achieve thebenefitsdescribedbecausetheproven benefitswere achievedintrials using thesedoses. Practice Point 3. 6. 2: Changes in blood pressure, serum creatinine, and serum potassium should be checked within 24 weeks of initiation or increase in the dose of a RASi, depending on the current glomerular filtration rate and serum potassium. Practice Point 3. 6. 3: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi. Practice Point 3. 6. 4: Continue angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose. Practice Point 3. 6. 5: Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in the setting of either symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate estimated glomerular filtration rate 15 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2). PracticePoint3. 6. 6: ConsiderstartingpeoplewithCKDwithnormaltomildlyincreasedalbuminuria(A1)onRASi(ACEior angiotensin receptor blocker) for specific indications (e. g. , to treat hypertension or heart failure with low ejection fraction). Practice Point 3. 6. 7: ContinueACEiorARB in peoplewithCKD even when the estimated glomerular filtration rate falls below 30 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2. 3. 7 Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor) The Work Group concurs with the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease, which stated: We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic kidney disease, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate 20 milliliters per minute per 1. 73m2withanSGLT2i(1A). 23However, inthepresentguideline, weofferamoregeneral1Arecommendationforadultswith chronic kidney disease.

Practice Point 3. 7. 1: Once an sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor is initiated, it is reasonable to continue an sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor even if the estimated glomerular filtration rate falls below 20 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2, unless it is not tolerated or KRT is initiated. Practice Point 3. 7. 2: It is reasonable to withhold sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor during times of prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical medical illness (when people may be at greater risk for ketosis). Recommendation 3. 7. 2: We recommend treating adults with chronic kidney disease with an sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor for the following (1A): (cid: 3) estimated glomerular filtration rate 20 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2 with urine albumin-creatinine ratio 200 magnesium/g (20 magnesium/mmol), or (cid: 3) heart failure, irrespective of level of albuminuria. Practice Point 3. 7. 3: sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor initiation or use does not necessitate alteration of frequency of chronic kidney disease monitoring and the reversible decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate on initiation is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy. Recommendation 3. 7. 3: We suggest treating adults with estimated glomerular filtration rate 20 to 45 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2 with urine albumin-creatinine ratio 200 magnesium/g (20 magnesium/mmol) with an sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (2B). 3.",

Practice Point 4. 2. 2: For most people and clinical settings, validated estimated glomerular filtration rate equations using serum creatinine are appropriate for drug dosing. Practice Point 4. 2. 3: Where more accuracy is required for drug-related decision-making (e. g. , dosing due to narrow therapeuticortoxicrange), drugtoxicity, orclinicalsituationswhereeGFRcrestimatesmaybeunreliable, use of equations that combine both creatinine and cystatin C, or measured glomerular filtration rate may be indicated.

Practice Point 4. 2. 5: Consider and adapt drug dosing in people where glomerular filtration rate, non-glomerular filtration rate determinants of the filtration markers, or volume of distribution are not in a steady state. 4. 3 Polypharmacy and drug stewardship Practice Point 4. 3. 1: Perform thorough medication review periodically and at transitions of care to assess adherence, continued indication, and potential drug interactions because people with chronic kidney disease often have complex medication regimens and are seen by multiple specialists.
