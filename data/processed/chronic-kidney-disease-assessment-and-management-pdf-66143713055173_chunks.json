All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (notice-of-rights). Chronic kidney disease: assessment and management (NG203) Your responsibility The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service. It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian. All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme. Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with complying with those duties. Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

It aims to prevent or delay the progression, and reduce the risk of complications and cardiovascular disease. It also covers managing anaemia and hyperphosphataemia associated with chronic kidney disease. Who is it for? Healthcare professionals Commissioners and providers People with chronic kidney disease, their families and carers NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights ( conditionsnotice-of-rights). 78 Chronic kidney disease: assessment and management (NG203) Recommendations People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care, as described in NICEs information on making decisions about your care. Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding. Adults, children and young people Some recommendations in this guideline apply to adults only, and we have specified adults in these individual recommendations. When a recommendation applies to children and young people only, we have also specified this in the recommendation. When recommendations apply to adults, children and young people we have specified this in recommendations at the beginning of a section. But for brevity, we have used people for later recommendations. When a recommendation refers to people, this means adults, children and young people. 1. 1 Investigations for chronic kidney disease Measuring kidney function Creatinine-based estimate of glomerular filtration rate 1. 1. 1 Whenever a request for serum creatinine measurement is made, clinical laboratories should report an estimate of (eGFRcreatinine) using a prediction equation (see recommendation 1. 1. 2) in addition to reporting the serum creatinine result. eGFRcreatinine may be less reliable in certain situations (for example, acute NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights ( conditionsnotice-of-rights). 78 Chronic kidney disease: assessment and management (NG203) kidney injury, pregnancy, oedematous states, muscle wasting disorders, and in adults who are malnourished, who have higher muscle mass or use protein supplements, or who have had an amputation) and has not been well validated in certain ethnic groups (for example, black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups with chronic kidney disease living in the UK). 2014 1. 1. 2 Clinical laboratories should: use the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (chronic kidney disease-EPI) creatinine equation to estimate GFRcreatinine for adults, using creatinine assays with calibration traceable to standardised reference material use creatinine assays that are specific (for example, enzymatic assays) and zero-biased compared with isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) participate in a UK national external quality assessment scheme for creatinine. 2014 The committee reviewed the evidence on creatinine-based estimation of glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate) in 2021. For a short explanation of why they did not make new recommendations, see the rationale and impact section on creatinine-based estimate of glomerular filtration rate. Full details of the evidence and the committees discussion are in evidence review A: diagnostic accuracy of estimated glomerular filtration rate calculations in adults, children, and young people from black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups with chronic kidney disease. 1. 1. 3 Interpret eGFRcreatinine with caution in adults with extremes of muscle mass, for example, in bodybuilders, people who have had an amputation or people with muscle wasting disorders. (Reduced muscle mass will lead to overestimation and increased muscle mass to underestimation of the glomerular filtration rate. ) 2008 1. 1.",

All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (notice-of-rights). of 78 Chronic kidney disease: assessment and management (NG203) Rationale and impact These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice. Creatinine-based estimate of glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate) Why the committee did not make recommendations Evidence on the specific estimated glomerular filtration rate equations or ethnicity adjustments seen by the committee was not from UK studies so may not be applicable to UK black, Asian and minority ethnic groups. None of the studies included children and young people. The committee was also concerned about the value of P30 as a measure of accuracy (P30 is the probability that the measured value is within 30% of the true value), the broad range of P30 values found across equations and the relative value or accuracy of ethnicity adjustments to estimated glomerular filtration rate equations in different ethnic groups. The committee agreed that adding an ethnicity adjustment to estimated glomerular filtration rate equations for different ethnicities may not be valid or accurate. Categorisations based on ethnicity lump together people with a diverse range of family backgrounds and differences in estimated glomerular filtration rate across ethnicities are likely to at least partly arise because of differences in average muscle mass between ethnic groups. However, muscle mass also differs from person to person within the same ethnicity and so making an adjustment based on ethnicity may be inaccurate for some people. Therefore, the committee agreed to remove the 2014 recommendation on how to adjust the chronic kidney disease-EPI creatinine equation for adults of African-Caribbean or African family origin. The committee highlighted the 2008 recommendation, which states that caution should be used when interpreting estimated glomerular filtration rate and in adults with extremes of muscle mass and on those who consume protein supplements (this was added to recommendation 1. 1. 1). The committee made recommendations for research on appropriate estimated glomerular filtration rate equations for black, Asian and minority ethnic groups (adults, children and young people) in the UK. They agreed that factors other than ethnicity should also be explored as biomarkers.",

    "text": "They agreed that factors other than ethnicity should also be explored as biomarkers. The committee agreed that in the absence of good evidence for their accuracy, the 2014 recommendations that cystatin-c equations should be considered during diagnosis in certain circumstances, should be removed. In particular, they noted that although using NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (notice-of-rights). of 78 Chronic kidney disease: assessment and management (NG203) cystatin-c equations may reduce false-positive results, it is likely to also increase falsenegative results. This will avoid potentially misleading tests being conducted and the costs associated with these. They made a recommendation for research for a large study using UK data to evaluate the accuracy of cystatin-c equations. Impact on practice There will be an impact on practice, as the adjustment of the chronic kidney disease-EPI creatinine equation for adults of African-Caribbean or African family origin has been removed from the guideline. Only a small number of centres in the UK currently use cystatin-c equations regularly, so most should not be affected by the removal of the cystatin-c recommendations. Return to recommendations Investigations for proteinuria Recommendations 1. 1. 10 to 1. 1. 14 Why the committee made the recommendations For children and young people with chronic kidney disease, there was no evidence for the accuracy of measuring albumin: creatinine ratio (albumin-creatinine ratio) compared with protein: creatinine ratio (protein-creatinine ratio) to quantify proteinuria. The committee discussed the recommendations for adults and agreed that, overall, these fit well with current practice and can be recommended for children and young people as well. The committee discussed the estimated glomerular filtration rate threshold recommended for quantifying urinary albumin or urinary protein loss in adults without diabetes. They agreed that this threshold is not appropriate for children and young people because any reduction in glomerular filtration rate in this population would prompt measuring proteinuria. Therefore, for children and young people they set the threshold for creatinine as above the upper limit of the age-appropriate reference range. The committee agreed to make a recommendation for research to identify the effect of measuring proteinuria with albumin-creatinine ratio compared with protein-creatinine ratio on the timing of treatment changes in children and young people with chronic kidney disease and the consequences of the delay in treatment NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (notice-of-rights). of 78 Chronic kidney disease: assessment and management (NG203) changes on different levels of proteinuria. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations are in line with current practice, so no additional resources should be needed. Return to recommendations Reagent strips for proteinuria and haematuria Recommendations 1. 1. 15 to 1. 1. 16 Why the committee made the recommendations The evidence showed that reagent strips were less useful to rule out than to rule in proteinuria. The committee highlighted that ruling out proteinuria with confidence was the main goal when using reagent strips. Therefore, they agreed that reagent strips should not be used to identify proteinuria in children and young people. The evidence was not reviewed for adults and so the committee agreed to retain the 2014 recommendation not to use reagent strips to identify proteinuria in adults unless the strips are capable of specifically measuring albumin at low concentrations and expressing the result as an albumin-creatinine ratio. The committee also highlighted that these tests are commonly used in clinical practice and agreed to make a further recommendation for further investigations in adults, children and young people with an incidental finding of unexplained proteinuria on reagent strips.",

There were only 2 studies, and only 1 showed that reagent strips could be useful. There was no evidence on the accuracy of reagent strips for haematuria in children and young people. The 2014 guideline (which did not cover children and young people) recommended reagent strips for detecting haematuria in adults.

Return to recommendations Who should be tested for chronic kidney disease Recommendations 1. 1. 20 to 1. 1. 25 Why the committee made the recommendations For children and young people, the evidence showed that acute kidney injury and solitary functioning kidney were clinically significant risk factors for developing chronic kidney disease. The committee highlighted that solitary functioning kidney was not due to kidney donation but to nephrectomy secondary to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract or to a lack of a kidney at birth or a non-functioning kidney. The committee highlighted that there were other important risk factors for developing chronic kidney disease in children and young people, but that no evidence was found for these. Based on their clinical knowledge and experience, they added gout as a risk factor for adults and low birth weight as a risk factor for children and young people. The committee agreed that the frequency of monitoring (for developing chronic kidney disease or progression) should be individualised for adults, children and young people. This is to address the different characteristics and risks that each person will have.

The committee agreed this is observed in clinical practice and any person presenting with an increase in estimated glomerular filtration rate decline would be monitored more frequently. The committee reviewed the recommendations and agreed that they are consistent with the evidence and clinical practice.

This should also be guided by rate of change in estimated glomerular filtration rate or albumin-creatinine ratio and specific comorbidities, including diabetes. albumin-creatinine ratio monitoring should be individualised. For example, albumin-creatinine ratio might be monitored more frequently in people with high albumin-creatinine ratio (categories A2 or A3), or if a change in albumin-creatinine ratio would affect management. The committee made a recommendation for research to identify the optimal frequency of albumin-creatinine ratio monitoring in adults, children and young people with chronic kidney disease. The committee discussed whether specific recommendations are needed for children and young people with chronic kidney disease and decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate, but agreed that this population would be referred to specialist care. How the recommendations might affect practice The committee noted that no changes had been made to the previous suggested monitoring schedule, and they believed it was relatively well implemented in clinical practice. Therefore, they were confident there should not be a substantial impact on practice from the new recommendations. NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

The results of both the validation study and costeffectiveness modelling undertaken for the guideline showed using this equation and threshold as a referral criteria (rather than an estimated glomerular filtration rate threshold) was likely to be both more sensitive and more specific than the criteria in the 2014 NICE guideline, meaning people who will progress to needing renal replacement therapy are identified earlier, and there are fewer unnecessary referrals to secondary care. The benefits of this approach over using an estimated glomerular filtration rate threshold (as in the 2014 NICE guideline) were not large, but the committee agreed they were meaningful. They also agreed there were additional potential benefits of using the 4-variable Kidney Failure Risk Equation, including the ability to provide people with an individual risk assessment, which could help them to proactively manage their own risk, and inform the management plans in secondary care. However, validation of the risk equation was only in adults, so the committee made a separate recommendation for children and young people. Black people were underrepresented in the study and, although there was a sizeable proportion of people of Asian family origin, the location of the study suggests that people of east Asian family origin were likely to be under-represented. Therefore, the committee agreed to make a recommendation for research for validation of the risk equation. The committee agreed that it is important to discuss with a person with chronic kidney disease what risk means. They added additional recommendations on providing information about risk, using jargon-free language, allowing enough time for discussions and documenting any decisions made. NICE 2025.

    "text": "Because the calculation requires both an estimated glomerular filtration rate and albumin-creatinine ratio value, it can only be produced if the GP requests both those measurements. These recommendations are intended to provide additional information to supplement estimated glomerular filtration rate and albumin-creatinine ratio values, rather than changing how often these values are requested by GPs. There may be particular difficulties for laboratories that store estimated glomerular filtration rate and albumin-creatinine ratio values on separate systems that cannot automatically communicate. In this situation, calculations may have to be done manually. However, this is still likely to be a more efficient system than calculations being carried out routinely by GPs. Overall, the referral criteria are predicted to slightly reduce monitoring costs but, excluding costs associated with dialysis, overall there should be no substantial impact on resource use. There may be an implementation period before the risk equation results are available to all GPs. Until then, some GPs may have to continue to base referral decisions on estimated glomerular filtration rate and albumin-creatinine ratio values independently, as is currently done, without providing patients with a quantitative assessment of their risk of needing renal replacement therapy. The faster these recommendations can be routinely adopted the less time it will be necessary for these 2 parallel approaches to both be in use. Return to recommendations Pharmacotherapy for blood pressure control Recommendations 1. 6. 1 to 1. 6. 3 Why the committee made the recommendations Results from a meta-analysis (including the SPRINT trial) showed no meaningful difference between standard and more intensive blood pressure targets for adults with chronic kidney disease. The 2014 guideline recommended maintaining systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg. This is consistent with clinical practice and with the NICE guideline on managing hypertension for people aged under 80. The committee noted that although there is limited evidence on blood pressure targets in people with chronic kidney disease NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (notice-of-rights). of 78 Chronic kidney disease: assessment and management (NG203) and proteinuria, it is important to maintain a systolic blood pressure below 130 mmHg and a diastolic pressure below 80 mmHg. The committee agreed that none of the evidence they had seen warranted changing the recommendations. They also noted that intensive blood pressure targets only result in a marginal reduction in stroke and kidney failure, but put a large burden on patients in terms of polypharmacy and associated risks and side effects (such as falls). The committee agreed that a useful target for blood pressure in children and young people with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria is a systolic blood pressure below the 50th percentile for height. The committee agreed that particular care had to be taken with people who were frail or who had multiple morbidities. However, the NICE guideline on hypertension already covers this group, so the committee did not make new recommendations. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations for adults are consistent with current practice and should not have an impact on resources. The recommendation for blood pressure targets in children and young people may have some cost implications, although the committee did not think they would be significant.

Paediatric experts on the committee agreed that the evidence for adults was also applicable to children and young people. Therefore, the committee did not make separate recommendations for different age groups. NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (notice-of-rights). of 78 Chronic kidney disease: assessment and management (NG203) The evidence for adults covered people with proteinuria or albuminuria, and included people with diabetes. This allowed the committee to make separate recommendations for people with and without diabetes. In the committees experience, many people with diabetes and chronic kidney disease are frail, or are taking a lot of medicines, so they made a recommendation to address this. People without diabetes The evidence showed that, compared with placebo, ACE inhibitors reduced the risk of end-stage renal disease in people without diabetes. ARBs did not show the same effect. However, the committee did not believe the evidence was sufficiently robust to show that ACE inhibitors were better than ARBs. In addition, for people with type 2 diabetes, ARBs did reduce the risk of end-stage renal disease and heart failure. Based on the limitations of the evidence and the evidence available for people with type 2 diabetes, the committee recommended both ACE inhibitors and ARBs. People with type 2 diabetes For people with type 2 diabetes, ARBs reduced the risk of end-stage renal disease and heart failure. The committee also recommended ACE inhibitors because the evidence did not show a clear difference between ACE inhibitors and ARBs on the following outcomes: reduction of proteinuria end-stage renal disease all-cause mortality cardiovascular mortality non-fatal cardiovascular events adverse events (hypotension) hospitalisation. There was no evidence comparing ACE inhibitors with placebo in people with type 2 diabetes. The evidence for people without diabetes did show that ACE inhibitors reduced the risk of end-stage renal disease, compared with placebo.

Return to recommendations Diagnostic role of glomerular filtration rate Recommendation 1. 7. 2 Why the committee made the recommendation There was limited evidence showing that estimated glomerular filtration rate thresholds below 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 could be used to identify anaemia as being due to chronic kidney disease. The committee questioned the applicability of this evidence because the studies did not rule out other causes of anaemia (which is usually done in practice). The limited evidence meant that the committee was unable to recommend specific thresholds or probabilities. Instead, they used the available evidence and their expertise to specify ranges of glomerular filtration rate indicating that anaemia is more or less likely to be caused by chronic kidney disease. When anaemia may have other causes (such as gastrointestinal bleeding and certain cancers), investigating further will increase the chance of the real cause being identified and treated. Clinical judgement is needed on how extensively to look for other causes when estimated glomerular filtration rate is between 30 and 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2. Healthcare professionals will need to balance the risks of: putting people through extensive and unnecessary investigations when their anaemia is caused by chronic kidney disease missing the real cause of their anaemia by assuming it is caused by chronic kidney disease. The committee agreed that when estimated glomerular filtration rate is below 30 milliliters per minute/1.",

However, healthcare professionals should still use their clinical judgement and think about peoples circumstances when deciding whether further NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (notice-of-rights). of 78 Chronic kidney disease: assessment and management (NG203) assessment is needed. Only 1 study included people with diabetes, and no studies included children and young people. However, the recommendations still apply to these populations, because other causes of anaemia would be ruled out before attributing the anaemia to chronic kidney disease. The committee noted a need for further research on the diagnostic test accuracy of different estimated glomerular filtration rate thresholds, particularly for estimated glomerular filtration rate thresholds of 30 and 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2. They highlighted that in clinical practice, an estimated glomerular filtration rate threshold of 45 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 can also trigger investigation into anaemia due to chronic kidney disease, but limited evidence was identified for the diagnostic accuracy of this threshold. The committee made a recommendation for research on the diagnostic accuracy of these specific estimated glomerular filtration rate thresholds for determining the likelihood of anaemia being chronic kidney disease related. How the recommendations might affect practice These recommendations should not increase the cost to primary care, because they reflect current practice and act as cautions for healthcare professionals to explore the cause of anaemia. They may reduce costs by ensuring that the correct cause of anaemia is identified more quickly with appropriate investigations. Return to recommendations Optimal hemoglobin levels Recommendation 1. 9. 11 Why the committee made the recommendation In the 2015 guideline, an aspirational hemoglobin range between 100 and 120 g/litre was recommended for adults, young people and children aged 2 years and over. For children under 2 years, the hemoglobin range was between 95 and 115 g/litre. These were based on evidence for adults. In 2020, the committee reviewed the evidence specifically for children and young people. The only evidence for this population came from a single small lowquality study, comparing the effects of a high and low hemoglobin target on left ventricular mass index. No difference in effect was found. Given the lack of evidence, the committee agreed that the recommendations made in 2015 should not be changed. NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (notice-of-rights). of 78 Chronic kidney disease: assessment and management (NG203) The 2015 guideline recommended using the same target hemoglobin range as adults for children and young people over 2 years, and a slightly lower level in children under 2. However, children and young people have different coagulation risks than adults, and are more prone to reductions in hemoglobin from blood loss in haemodialysis circuits. In practice, higher hemoglobin targets (up to 130 g/litre) are often used for children and young people. Because of the lack of evidence in this age group, the committee made a recommendation for research on optimal hemoglobin levels for managing anaemia in children and young people to inform future guidance Return to recommendations Correcting iron deficiency Recommendation 1. 9. 18 Why the committee made the recommendation For people with stage 5 chronic kidney disease who are on in-centre haemodialysis, the evidence showed that high-dose intravenous iron was better than a low-dose regimen at increasing levels of serum ferritin and haemoglobin as well as increasing the haematocrit.",

    "text": "The committee agreed that the type of intravenous iron was not relevant and that there was no reason to recommend a specific preparation. They also highlighted that there are differences between iron preparations that affect their bioequivalence. Therefore, pharmacist advice is likely to be needed when choosing iron preparations. An example regimen for adults using iron sucrose was taken from the evidence to help guide practice. Ultimately, the choice of preparation should be based on local availability and policies. The committee agreed that children and young people should be given a high dose as set out in the BNFc, although they noted that use of intravenous iron preparations in children under 14 years was off label. The committee was aware of a MHRA alert on intravenous iron and serious hypersensitivity reactions. The alert states that intravenous iron products should only be administered when staff trained to evaluate and manage anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions as well as resuscitation facilities are immediately available. The committee agreed that intravenous iron should not be administered at home but recognised that this has a significant impact on people on home dialysis. Most of the evidence was from studies with participants on haemodialysis. The committee NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights ( conditionsnotice-of-rights). 78 Chronic kidney disease: assessment and management (NG203) agreed that more research would help to inform future guidance on intravenous iron for people with stage 5 chronic kidney disease who are on peritoneal dialysis. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations are unlikely to lead to a substantial change in costs, as intravenous iron is relatively inexpensive, and there was evidence found in adults that use of high-dose iron leads to lower doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents being used, thereby offsetting any extra costs. Return to recommendations Hyperphosphataemia in people with chronic kidney disease stage 4 or 5 Recommendations 1. 11. 5 to 1. 11. 18 Why the committee made the recommendations There was a significant amount of evidence (of varying quality) for adults with stage 5 chronic kidney disease who are having dialysis. However, evidence was limited for adults not on dialysis, and for children and young people. The committee agreed to extrapolate from the evidence for adults with stage 5 chronic kidney disease on dialysis, so they could make recommendations for the other groups. Peoples preferences need to be taken into account when offering phosphate binders, because this could have an impact on adherence. The differences in phosphate binder formulations (for example, chewable and non-chewable) and the effect this has on how they are taken (before, with or after food) mean that people will often prefer one phosphate binder over the others. Oral phosphate binders are also unpleasant to take, and this might affect adherence as well. It is important to involve people in the choice of phosphate binder as far as possible, to ensure they are prescribed one they are happy with and can take as recommended. The committee highlighted several factors that renal physicians assess at clinical reviews for people who are taking phosphate binders (including parathyroid hormone, vitamin D and serum calcium). NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights ( conditionsnotice-of-rights). 78 Chronic kidney disease: assessment and management (NG203) Which phosphate binders to use for children and young people The committee reviewed the recommendations from the 2013 guideline in the light of limited new evidence. For children and young people with high serum calcium, they agreed to recommend sevelamer carbonate instead of sevelamer hydrochloride.

The committee highlighted that in growing children and young people, calcium is often maintained close to, but not above the upper limit of the age-related reference range. Calcium is essential for bone development in children. Which phosphate binders to use for adults The committee reviewed the evidence for phosphate binders both in adults on dialysis and adults not having dialysis. Although the evidence for those not on dialysis was limited, it did reflect the evidence for adults on dialysis in every area apart from sucroferric oxyhydroxide. As there was no evidence on sucroferric oxyhydroxide in adults not on dialysis, the committee did not recommend it for this group. The evidence showed that the most cost-effective treatment strategy is to start with calcium acetate, and switch to sevelamer carbonate if the person gets hypercalcaemia. This is because: calcium acetate as a first-line treatment provides the best balance of benefits, harms and costs calcium carbonate is cheaper than calcium acetate, but is more likely to cause high serum calcium levels and associated adverse outcomes sevelamer carbonate and sevelamer hydrochloride are more expensive than calcium acetate, and do not provide enough benefit as a first-line treatment to justify the extra expense when people have high serum calcium levels and cannot take calcium acetate, sevelamer carbonate is the best alternative; it is cheaper than sevelamer hydrochloride, and provides similar benefits, however, it still costs more than calcium acetate and, for first-line treatment, it does not provide enough benefit to justify this extra expense sucroferric oxyhydroxide is not cost effective as a first-line treatment, but is a reasonable choice for people who cannot take calcium acetate or sevelamer NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights ( conditionsnotice-of-rights). 78 Chronic kidney disease: assessment and management (NG203) carbonate lanthanum carbonate is much more expensive than calcium acetate and sevelamer carbonate and may provide less benefit than other non-calcium-based phosphate binders. Based on this evidence, the committee recommended a treatment sequence and alternatives for different situations. The committee also agreed that diet and dialysis (when appropriate) had a large impact on serum phosphate levels. Therefore, before offering phosphate binders it is important to provide dietary advice and ensure people are on the dialysis regime that works best for them. The committee made a recommendation for research to address the lack of evidence in adults not on dialysis. How the recommendations might affect practice Replacing sevelamer hydrochloride with sevelamer carbonate may result in lower resource use, because there is a cheap generic version of sevelamer carbonate available. There is currently variation across the UK in use of sucroferric oxyhydroxide. The recommendation on this phosphate binder may increase costs. However, this increase is unlikely to be substantial, because sucroferric oxyhydroxide is only recommended as a third-line option. Return to recommendations NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

    "text": "chronic kidney disease is usually asymptomatic, but it is detectable, and tests for chronic kidney disease are simple and available. There is evidence that treatment can prevent or delay the progression of chronic kidney disease, reduce or prevent the development of complications, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, chronic kidney disease is often unrecognised or diagnosed at an advanced stage. Late presentation of people with kidney failure increases morbidity, mortality and associated healthcare costs. As kidney disease progresses, some coexisting conditions become more common and increase in severity. Hyperphosphataemia is an example of this, occurring because of insufficient filtering of phosphate from the blood by poorly functioning kidneys. This means that a certain amount of the phosphate does not leave the body in the urine, instead remaining in the blood at abnormally high levels. High serum phosphate levels can directly and indirectly increase parathyroid hormone secretion, leading to the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Left untreated, secondary hyperparathyroidism increases morbidity and mortality and may lead to renal bone disease, with people experiencing bone and muscular pain, fracture, bone and joint abnormalities, and vascular and soft tissue calcification. Many people with chronic kidney disease or established renal failure also develop associated anaemia. The prevalence of anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease increases progressively with the stage of chronic kidney disease, especially when the person reaches stage 4 or 5. Anaemia of chronic kidney disease contributes significantly to the burden of chronic kidney disease. However, it is potentially reversible and manageable with appropriate identification and treatment. The Health Survey for England (2016) found that 13% of adults (16 years and over) had any chronic kidney disease (stages 1 to 5). The prevalence of stages 3 to 5 was 5% for all adults, rising to 34% in people aged 75 and over.

Subject to Notice of rights ( conditionsnotice-of-rights). 78 Chronic kidney disease: assessment and management (NG203) Update information November 2021: We reviewed the evidence on SGLT2 inhibitors for adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease and made new recommendations, which are in the section on chronic kidney disease in the NICE guideline on type 2 diabetes in adults. We also clarified the use of the term male in the 4-variable Kidney Failure Risk Equation. August 2021: This guideline is an update of NICE guideline CG182 (published July 2014), NICE guideline CG157 (published March 2013) and NICE guideline NG8 (published June 2015) and will replace them. We have reviewed the evidence and made new recommendations on the assessment and management of chronic kidney disease, management of hyperphosphataemia in people with chronic kidney disease and the management of anaemia for people with chronic kidney disease. These recommendations are marked 2021. We have also made some changes without an evidence review: We have updated some wording to bring the language and style up to date, without changing the meaning. We have updated some recommendations to bring them in line with current terminology and practice. We have combined, clarified or reworded some recommendations to make them clearer and to improve ease of reading. In recommendations ending 2006, 2006, amended 2011, 2006, amended 2015, 2008, 2008, amended 2014, or 2014, we have not reviewed the evidence. In some cases minor changes have been made for example, to update links, or bring the language and style up to date without changing the intent of the recommendation. Minor changes after publication August 2025: We added links to relevant technology appraisal guidance in the sections on pharmacotherapy and managing anaemia. September 2024: We added links to relevant technology appraisal guidance in the NICE 2025. All rights reserved.
