ORG 3 Introduction Thinking about things like sickness and death is not easy for anyone. Yet, each of ultrasound may be faced with choices concerning life and death at some time in our lives. How comfortable we are with these choices affects our lives and the lives of those we love. This booklet has been prepared to help you and your loved ones feel better about making these hard choices. It will answer questions you may be asking yourself. Today, medical advances have made it possible for many diseases to be treated successfully, adding to life expectancy and quality of life. However, lifesaving advances sometimes create situations in which you or someone you love is kept alive but is unable to communicate what their choice would have been about the treatment being given. Often, doctors and loved ones are asked to make difficult treatment decisions. In some cases, the courts have been called on to make life or death decisions. This booklet contains information about decisions you can make before a medical crisis occurs. With this information, you can choose to prepare a legal document to guide loved ones, your doctor, and other healthcare providers in caring for you. Making these decisions in advance helps your loved ones, and spares them the burden of making decisions for you in a medical crisis. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION What is the Patient Self-Determination Act? The Patient Self-Determination Act, which went into effect in December 1991, gives adults with the capability to make medical decisions for themselves, the right to make decisions today about healthcare treatment they would want to receive in the future if they could not communicate what they want at that time. This law requires that hospitals, nursing homes and other health agencies give all patients information about their right to have a legal document called an advance directive. New regulations for dialysis units require that patients be informed about advance directives and the right to refuse treatment. KIDNEY. ORG 5 What is an advance directive? An advance directive is a legal document that informs doctors and healthcare providers of medical decisions you have made for future crisis care if you cannot communicate these decisions for yourself. If you have an advance directive in your medical record, your doctor and other healthcare providers can take care of you according to your wishes as stated in the advance directive. Are there different kinds of advance directives? There are two basic kinds of advance directives.",

    "text": "Are there different kinds of advance directives? There are two basic kinds of advance directives. A living will, the most common type of advance directive, tells your doctor or healthcare provider in writing what type of medical care you want or 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION do not want if you should become unable to make these decisions for yourself. Another type of advance directive is called a durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions or a healthcare proxy. This document allows you to name someone, such as a family member or close friend, to act on your behalf to make medical decisions for you if you are unable to make these decisions for yourself. The person who acts on your behalf is called your surrogate. It is important to ask this person if they are willing to act as your agent and to talk about which treatments you would and would not want as well as your shortand long-term goals and values. Your states laws typically allow you to have both a living will and a durable power of attorney or to combine them in a single form. You may want to speak to a lawyer or contact your state or local bar association about your states laws concerning advance directives. You may also want to speak to a social worker at your dialysis unit. Why is an advance directive important to me? An advance directive is important for two reasons. First, it lets you make your own decisions about your future healthcare, even if you are not able to make decisions, such as whether to continue or stop certain treatments, at the time these decisions are needed. Second, it tells your doctor and loved ones which treatments you want and do not want if you are not able to communicate your wishes. Knowing your wishes helps your doctor and loved ones feel more comfortable making healthcare decisions for you. KIDNEY. ORG 7 What types of decisions can I make? With an advance directive, you may be able to: accept all treatments recommended by a healthcare provider accept some treatments and refuse others refuse all recommended treatments Some states may limit your ability to delegate the authority to refuse one or more types of treatment to someone else, for example, providing artificial nutrition or water. Some states may require that treatment be continued once it is accepted by your surrogate. It is important to speak with a lawyer or a social worker at your hospital or dialysis unit, or get a copy of your states advance directive forms. (See Where can I get advance directives forms? on. ) 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Which treatments can I include in my advance directive? You can choose to receive pain medicine for comfort, even if you refuse other treatments. You may be able to accept or refuse additional treatments, such as: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to attempt to revive a heart that has stopped beating. (CPR includes heart massage, drugs, electric shocks, and artificial breathing machines. ) Tube feedings, including giving food, water or both through a tube into a vein or the stomach. Artificial respiration, which is a machine (ventilator or respirator) that breathes for a person through a tube in the throat. Antibiotics to fight infection. Dialysis, either hemodialysis or peritoneal for kidney failure. Surgery such as heart bypass, gall bladder removal, etc. Blood transfusions or blood products, including specifying whether you would want blood only from your family members or friends. KIDNEY. ORG 9 Can an advance directive state the conditions under which dialysis could be stopped or continued? Yes.",

    "text": "KIDNEY. ORG 9 Can an advance directive state the conditions under which dialysis could be stopped or continued? Yes. An advance directive enables you to tell your doctor and loved ones your feelings and wishes for continued treatment if and when you are no longer able to make this decision for yourself. You may tell your surrogate to stop dialysis if you: Develop severe brain damage (caused by stroke, Alzheimers disease, etc. ) and that you do not know or understand what is happening around you Cannot move independently (due to a stroke, paralysis, etc) Need to totally depend on others You may also state that you want to continue dialysis until: you die from another cause your doctor advises your surrogate that continued treatment is not medically reasonable Am I required by law to have an advance directive? No. The federal law and various state laws and regulations permit patients to sign advance directives but do not require you to sign them. A dialysis unit or hospital cannot require you to sign an advance directive. 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Do I need to see a lawyer to make an advance directive? You do not need to see a lawyer to make an advance directive. Usually, a social worker at your dialysis unit or hospital can help you. To find out more about the laws in your state, you may want to speak to a lawyer, a social worker at your treatment center or senior citizen center, or contact your state or local bar association. Also, see the resources listed starting on. KIDNEY. ORG 11 Where can I get advance directives forms? You can get copies of forms from your state or local bar association, most senior citizen centers, and those healthcare providers who are required to give information. You can also get your state forms on the Internet from state health department websites or from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (call or write for forms at the address or phone number listed on ). You can list the treatments you would or would not want without using a form, but a court or medical provider may not accept it. It is best to complete an advance directive on a state-approved form. 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Do advance directives forms have to be witnessed? Advance directives must comply with your states laws and regulations. State laws may require that these forms be witnessed or notarized. Banks and many other businesses have notaries who will notarize these forms. In some states, doctors and other healthcare providers are not permitted to witness advance directives. Should I speak to my doctor before making an advance directive? Yes. Your doctor can help explain treatment options to help you fill out the form. Also, you can let your doctor know what you would want under an advance directive and find out whether he or she would object to carrying one out. If so, you may want to find a doctor who will agree to treat you the way you want. How will people know if I have an advance directive? The only way your loved ones, friends, doctor or other healthcare providers will know that you have an advance directive is if you tell them. You may also want to give them a copy of your advance directive. The advance directive can be made a part of your medical record. Give a copy to your doctor and ask the hospital where you are treated to put a copy in your medical record.",
