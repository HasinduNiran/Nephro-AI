As a result of the surveillance progamme, the Ministry of Health possesses statistics on patients with the Chronic Kidney Disease. The active surveillance by means of screening asymptomatic people living in the high risk areas for Chronic Kidney Disease of Uncertain aetiology has enabled detection of more cases compared to previous years. I appreciate the deliberations made by the Epidemiology Unit to revise the screening guidelines keeping abreast with the current evidence based practices. I believe that the screening guidelines will be extensively used by the health care works in the field in indemnifying suspected cases. I congratulate the Epidemiology Unit and the panel of experts for accomplishing the task of revising the screening guidelines Dr. P. G. Mahipala Director General of Health Services v Message from the Chief Epidemiologist Screening of inhabitants in high risk areas where Chronic Kidney Disease of Uncertain aetiology is an integral part of the surveillance programme conducted by the Epidemiology Unit. First screening guidelines for community screening was set in 2014 in order to streamline and standardize the ongoing screening programmes. Based on scientific evidence, experts have suggested some changes to the previously set guidelines. Considering evolving science and feasibility at the ground level, revisions were made. I sincerely feel that the revised guidelines will serve as a comprehensive guide for those engaged in the screening programme. I take this opportunity extent my gratitude to those who have contributed their expertise without hesitation.

T. N. Hewageegana Consultant Chemical Pathologist Dr. S Dassanayake Consultant Physician Dr. Zied Badurdeem Temporary Lecture in Pharmacology Dr. Chamly Premajayantha Medical Officer viii Introduction During the recent past, high prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease was observed in some geographic areas of Sri Lanka. Especially the North Central Province (NCP) was noted as an endemic area for chronic kidney disease. Some areas outside the NCP, but geographically adjacent, were later on detected to have similarly high prevalence of chronic kidney disease. Unfortunately, a fair proportion of chronic kidney disease cases were not attributable to known aetiological factors. This scenario has led to coining a term Chronic Kidney Disease of Uncertain aetiology (CKDu). The unknown aetiology has hampered implementation of effective preventive measures over the years. At present, scientific data are available on the high endemicity of chronic kidney disease in these areas. The World Health Organization (WHO) report on Kidney Disease of Uncertain Aetiology (CKDu) in Sri Lanka says that the age standardized prevalence of CKDu among females in the age group of 15 to 70 years of age is 16. 9% and that of males in the same age category is 12. 9%. In January 2014, the Standing Cabinet Appointed Officials Committee for the Mitigation of CKDu in the North Central Province has recommended to establish a criterion for diagnosing CKDu patients and to plan a systematic Screening Programme for early diagnosis. It has further recommended mapping the cases of chronic kidney disease/CKDu considering the Grama Niladhari (glomerulonephritis) divisions as the base for mapping. The Screening Programme for chronic kidney disease/CKDu is intended to detect asymptomatic individuals in the early stages of chronic kidney disease. The screening programme will serve as a comprehensive and active epidemiological surveillance with provisions for mapping and analyzing attributes and possible aetiologies. 1 Surveillance on Chronic Kidney Disease in Sri Lanka The Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka has established surveillance on chronic kidney disease since October 2013. Thirty hospitals were declared as sentinel sites initially with further expansion now the total number is 50. The rationale of selecting the hospitals as sentinel sites was the available statistics on the disease burden and the media reports and public concerns of the presence of the disease in geographic locations. Based on the hospital statistics and the statistics at the renal research unit, the Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura districts and geographically adjacent areas namely, Dehiattakandiya, Girandurukotte, Welioya, Polpithigama, Padavi Sripura, Wilgamuwa and Vavuniya South Divisional Secretariat divisions were proclaimed as high risk areas. The hospitals catering to the populations in the proclaimed areas were selected as sentinel sites. Another set of hospitals were selected on the basis of patients referral mechanisms, resource availability including availability of specialists services, having renal clinics. In Addition, some institutions were selected considering the potentials of having the disease, anecdotal reports on the presence of disease and public concerns on the presence of the disease. As surveillance continues, the list of sentinel sites could be evolved based on the evidence generated. 2 1. DH Padawiya 26. DH Kahatagasdigiliya 2. DH Madawachchiya 27. DH Thanamalwila 3.

DH Hettipola, Wilgamuwa Objectives of the Screening Programme Detect asymptomatic individuals in the preclinical stages of the chronic kidney disease Assess the disease burden of chronic kidney disease/CKDu in the entire country giving priority to CKDu endemic areas Refer those found positive in the screening to the curative care system for further medical evaluation, and if found to have the disease, for clinical care. Study the factors associated with the chronic Kidney Disease with uncertain aetiology 3 Methodology Screening Method Selective Screening The programme will aim at screening high risk group defined by age limits giving priorities to endemic areas. Chemical assays will be carried out on urine and blood to detect chronic kidney disease/CKDu. High risk geographic areas Following a series of consultative meetings, the panel of experts decided upon the under-mentioned areas as high risk considering the present pattern of geographic distribution of cases. No Province District DS Division 01 North Central Anuradhapura All 02 North Central Polonnaruwa All 03 North Western Kurunegala Polpithigama Giribawa 04 Eastern Ampara Dehiattakandiya 05 Eastern Trincomalee Padavi Sripura 06 Uva Badulla Mahiyanganaya Rideemaliyadda 07 North Mullaitivu Welioya 08 North Vavuniya Vavuniya Vavuniya South 09 Central Matale Wilgamuwa Primary Target Group In endemic areas, those who are above the age of twenty years are eligible to be screened. In non-endemic arrears, 4 those who are above the age of thirty will be considered eligible for screening. Exclusion Criteria Those who are suffering from acute illness, pregnant women and women during menstruation are not eligible for screening. Suitable measures need to be assured to screen them once they recover from contraindications. Screening Settings Community Settings Screening will be carried out in community settings on pre determined dates with prior notification given to the target population. Screening will be carried out at Field Screening Clinics conducted in places easily accessible to the catchment population, preferably at the Gramodaya Health Centres, Central Dispensaries, Hospitals, and Offices of the Public Health Inspectors, Offices of Medical Officers of Health or any other facility depending on the programmatic feasibility. Screening Tool The screening tool is a package consisting of a combination of tests, testing for Serum Creatinine with calculating estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate), measuring urine albumin creatinine ratio (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio) on an early morning urine sample and measuring blood pressure. Administration of Screening Tool The tool is expected to be administered in the community setting, in a field screening clinic. The data sheet needs to be filled with legible letters and all fields must be filled. Collecting and Dispatching of Blood Samples 5 The responsibility of venipuncture and proper labelling of samples of blood is vested upon the Public Health Nursing Sister and Nursing Officer.",
    "Venipuncture should follow the routine procedure practised in hospital settings. Either plain tubes or Serum Separating Tubes (Serum separating tubes are preferred) should be used for collecting blood. 3 ml of blood is required. If plain tubes are used, the separated serum needs to be transferred to a secondary tube taking precautions to label properly. The secondary tubes or the Serum Separating Tubes (SST) should be stored in cool boxes with ice packs in a temperature ranging from 10 to 150C. The properly stored samples should reach the laboratory within a maximum of six hours. Collecting and Dispatching Urine Samples Urine sample of 30 ml, preferably from the first or second void needs to be collected in a screw capped container. Overnight rest with a good sleep needs to be ensured before collecting the sample. Practice of proper labelling needs to be adhered to. 6 Samples should be stored in Igloo type cool boxes in the temperature range of 2 to 80C as soon as they reach the field screening clinic. Urine samples should not be stored with blood/serum samples. Urine sample should not be frozen/ kept at below 00C. Testing for serum Creatinine and calculating estimated glomerular filtration rate The testing should be done as soon as the samples reach the testing laboratory, necessarily not exceeding 24 hours from the time of sample collection. Jaffe Kinetic Method should be used in testing for serum Creatinine in an appropriated fully automated analyzer to ensure the validity of the test. chronic kidney disease-EPI formula is suggested to be used to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate. Patients age and sex are required for the calculation. Quality Assurance of laboratory tests Internal Quality Assurance Every testing laboratory should strictly follow the quality control guidelines prescribed here. At the beginning of the day, internal quality control should be performed at two levels. Further, level I II quality control should be performed on completion of every hundred tests. 7 The equipment shall be calibrated with traceability established calibrators on instructions from the manufacturer. In an event of quality failure, the equipments should be calibrated immediately. Proper maintenance of the equipment according to manufacturers instructions is mandatory. External Quality Assurance The Chemical Pathology Department of the Medical Research Institute (magnetic resonance imaging) of Sri Lanka will serve as the national reference laboratory for external quality control of the screening programme. The magnetic resonance imaging would o monitor the internal quality assurance serum creatinine, urine albumin and urine creatinine assays o distribute quality assurance serum and urine samples on a regular basis to selected labs o harmonize serum creatinine results between labs selected for chronic kidney disease screening o achieve traceability of creatinine assay to IDMS traceable creatinine assay o Supervise on a distant basis calculation of estimated glomerular filtration rate in laboratories where chemical pathologists are not available o monitor urine albumin creatinine ratio similarly o training of MLTs in those hospitals for internal and external quality assurance o quality inspection visits Carry out monthly, inter-laboratory evaluation with standard samples. 8 Cutoff Values for Blood Pressure and Laboratory Investigations Blood Pressure 140 mmhg and 90 mmhg would be stipulated as upper limit of normal for systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively. Either of the readings above these levels would be taken as high blood pressure. Serum Creatinine Sex specific reference ranges given for creatinine assay by the manufacturer would be taken as the reference limits for serum creatinine. Any value above the upper reference limit would be considered as positive screening test for chronic kidney disease. Estimated glomerular filtration fate (estimated glomerular filtration rate) below 60ml/1.",
    "Estimated glomerular filtration fate (estimated glomerular filtration rate) below 60ml/1. 73m2/min is taken as positive for screening for chronic kidney disease. Urine Albumin Creatinine Ratio (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio) 30 magnesium/g of creatinine would be considered as the upper normal normal for urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Values above this level would be considered as positive in screening for chronic kidney disease. Interpretation of Results If a person gets any one of the screening tests positive (serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio) he or she would be considered as positive for screening test, irrespective of their blood pressure reading levels. 9 Referral Procedure for Persons with Abnormal Test Results Persons who are negative for both investigations and for blood pressure measurements will be considered as negative for screening and reviewed in three years time in a similar screening programme. Persons who report only elevated blood pressure would be referred to nearby curative care facilities for follow up with regard to elevated blood pressure. This category is also considered as negative for the screening programme. Persons who are considered as positive (having either elevated S. Creatinine or low estimated glomerular filtration rate or elevated urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio irrespective of blood pressure levels) for screening should be channelled to curative care facilities for further evaluation by means of history, clinical examination, biochemical investigations and radiological, histological assessments (protocols need to be developed). Persons who are found positive at secondary evaluation would be referred to the Nephrologists clinics as specified in clinical management guidelines. Responsibilities Provisions of technical guidance and database management for the screening programme are vested with the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health. Implementation of the screening programme comes under the purview of provincial health authorities. In the North Central Province, the Renal Research Unit will take part in the planning and implementation of the screening programme. 10 In the districts where Medical Officers/ chronic kidney disease prevention have been appointed, the MO/chronic kidney disease holds the responsibility of implementation of the screening programme. In other districts where there is no appointed MO/chronic kidney disease, the Regional Epidemiologist is responsible for the implementation of the screening programme. The Medical Officer of Health is held responsible for conducting screening clinics in the area according to an approved advanced programme. The heads of curative care institutions in the areas are expected to support the screening programme specially with respect to human resource mobilization. The RE or MO/chronic kidney disease should liaise with the MOH and heads of curative care institutions in planning and implementation of the screening programme. Field Screening Clinics The screening clinics should be planned in such a way that once a round of screening clinic is over, the entire Medical Officer of Health area should be covered. When identifying the places, accessibility of the catchment population should be considered a priority requirement. The MO/chronic kidney disease or RE should work together to identify the sites to conduct Field Screen Clinics. The clinics should commence by 8. 00 am and continue till the target is covered. The clinics can be planned on any day including weekends considering the ground realities of resource mobilization. Every fortnight, a screening clinic should be conducted in the office of the MOH (Central Screening Clinic) to cater for those who missed the area field clinic. The date, time and venue of the screening clinic should be informed to the population to be screened by any means. 11 All individuals screened at the clinic should be registered in the field screening clinic and a Clinic Registration Card should be issued.",
    "All particulars should be entered in legible letters. At the time of Screening, a session on health education should be conducted according to the guidelines set by the Health Education Bureau. Human Resources The team should consist of the following categories of health staff, Medical Officers Public Health Nursing officer or Nursing Sisters or Nursing officer Public Health Midwife of the respective area Public Health Inspector of the respective area Medical Laboratory Technologists Other necessary supportive staff. Implementation Plan At the outset of the programme, an implementation plan for each district should be drafted covering the entire high risk area. The Provincial and Regional Directors of Health Services, Regional Epidemiologists, Medical Officers (chronic kidney disease Prevention), Medical Officer in Charge of the Renal Research Unit of the NCP (in case of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Districts only) and heads of curative care institutions should take part in the planning process. The areas with high disease burden should be covered in the initial stages of the programme. 12 Following factors need to be considered in planning the programme. Spatial distribution of cases Availability of logistics Availability of human resources Capacities of laboratories to handle samples Routine health care delivery in the field The plan should include The number of clinic sessions per district with a breakdown at MOH division level for each quarter Locations of field screening clinics Tentative date of each clinic Locations and tentative dates of central screening clinics The number of individuals to be covered in each clinic session Human resource mobilization plan for each clinic The tentative district programme should be submitted to the Deputy Director General of Health Services (Public Health Services) I and the Chief Epidemiologist. Monitoring and Evaluation The programe would be continuously monitored and evaluated quarterly at district, provincial and national level. The Regional Directors and the Provincial Directors should continuously monitor the implementation of the screening programme in the respective districts and provinces. At district level, monthly evaluation needs to be conducted 13 before the 10th of the subsequent month and the evaluation report should be submitted to the office of the PDHS and the Chief Epidemiologist. Quarterly review would be conducted at the Epidemiology Unit with the participation of PDHSS, RDHSS, REE, and MOO/chronic kidney disease at the end of each quarter. District level Indicator and targets Total number screened during the month Proportion of Screening Clinics conducted Percent coverage of screening at field clinics Percent positive Number screened at the central clinic Percent screened at central clinic In addition, at district reviews, attention must be paid to any failures in conducting the total planned number of clinics for 14 each month. In-depth fact finding analysis needs to be done as to the cause for failing to conduct the planned number of clinics. Remedial actions need to be identified to prevent further failures of similar nature. Further, analysis needs to done to investigate into any other reasons for the gap between the target and the reported percent coverage of screening. National level Indicators Total number screened Percent coverage Percent positive National level indicators will be analyzed at quarterly reviews. In addition, the programmatic issues will be looked into. Data Analysis and dissemination of information Data will be compiled and analyzed at the Epidemiology Unit together with the statistics generated by the Sentinel Surveillance and information will be published in the Quarterly Epidemiological Bulletin. 15"
