    "Healthy Eating for Adults with Chronic Kidney Disease In this section: Why is healthy eating important for adults with CKD? What aspects of nutrition are important for adults with CKD? How can I eat healthy with CKD? What is medical nutrition therapy? Clinical Trials for Healthy Eating for Adults with CKD Why is healthy eating important for adults with CKD? Healthy kidneys balance salts and minerals in the blood. When you have chronic kidney disease (CKD), the kidneys cant filter your blood the way they should. What you eat and drink can help your kidneys maintain a healthy balance of salts and minerals in your body and help you feel better. Choosing healthy foods and beveragesand avoiding foods high in sodium, potassium, and phosphorusmay prevent or delay some health problems from CKD. What you eat and drink may also affect how well your kidney disease treatments work. Understanding how different nutrients and liquids affect the body is important for people with CKD. As CKD advances, nutritional needs change. Your health care professional may recommend you choose foods more carefully and may suggest you work with a registered dietitian, if possible, to create an eating plan for your individual needs. You can find a registered dietitian External link who specializes in kidney disease through the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics online or through your health care professional. The nutritional needs for children with CKD are different than for adults. Learn more. What aspects of nutrition are important for adults with CKD? Calories The foods and beverages you eat and drink give your body energy. The energy is measured in calories. If you consume fewer calories than your body uses, you may lose weight. Losing too much weight can make you sicker. Fat Fat gives your body energy, helps control your cholesterol and blood pressure levels, and helps your body absorb vitamins. Fat also provides nutrients your body needs and is an important part of a healthy eating plan. Everyone needs some fat in their diet, but too much fat or choosing foods higher in saturated fat or trans fat may cause buildup in your blood vessels, heart, and kidneys. People with CKD have a higher risk of developing heart and blood vessel disease NIH external link and should focus on consuming healthier unsaturated fats while limiting saturated and trans fats. Liquids Your body needs liquids to function properly. However, people with CKD may need to limit how much liquid they consume because damaged kidneys cant remove extra fluid. Talk with your health care professional about how much liquid you should have each day. Phosphorus Damaged kidneys cant remove phosphorus from the blood as well as healthy kidneys can. Phosphorus can build up in the blood in people with CKD. Too much phosphorus in your blood can harm your blood vessels and make your bones thin, weak, and more likely to break. High levels of phosphorus in your blood can also cause itchy skin and bone and joint pain.",
    "Phosphorus can build up in the blood in people with CKD. Too much phosphorus in your blood can harm your blood vessels and make your bones thin, weak, and more likely to break. High levels of phosphorus in your blood can also cause itchy skin and bone and joint pain. Potassium CKD can make it harder for the kidneys to remove potassium from the blood, and the potassium levels in the blood can become very high. Having too little or too much potassium in your blood can cause heart and muscle problems. For this reason, its important to work with a dietitian or health care professional to help find the right amount of potassium for you. Protein Protein helps build and maintain muscle, bone, skin, connective tissue, internal organs, and blood. Protein also helps fight disease and heal wounds. As your body uses protein, the protein breaks down into waste. Your kidneys remove this waste from the blood. Some people with CKD may need to consume moderate amounts of protein so waste doesnt build up in the blood. However, too little protein may lead to malnutrition, a condition that occurs when your body doesnt get enough nutrients. Work with a dietitian or health care professional to find the right balance of protein to make sure you are properly nourished without causing strain to your kidneys. Sodium Sodium is a mineral that helps control the amount of fluids in your body. Sodium is found in table salt and in many processed foods. Too much sodium causes your blood to retainor hold on tofluids. When your body retains fluids, it can cause high blood pressure and swelling, putting stress on your kidneys and heart. Be aware of the amount of sodium in the foods and beverages you consume and work with your dietitian or health care professional to determine your sodium limit. A smiling woman holding a grocery bag of food in her kitchen. Eating healthy with CKD can help your kidneys maintain a healthy balance of salts and minerals in your body and can help you feel better. How can I eat healthy with CKD? There is no single meal plan for everyone with CKD. In the early stages of CKD, you may have few limits to what you can eat and drink. As your CKD advances and your nutritional needs change, you may need to make more changes to your diet. Talk with your health care team about challenges you may have finding healthy food. A health care professional, dietitian, or social worker may be able to recommend resources that can help you. The U. S. Department of Agriculture also has a list of resources External link for finding and affording healthy food. Pay attention to calories People with CKD may avoid eating because they dont feel hungry or because foods or beverages dont taste the same.",
    "The U. S. Department of Agriculture also has a list of resources External link for finding and affording healthy food. Pay attention to calories People with CKD may avoid eating because they dont feel hungry or because foods or beverages dont taste the same. If you find that you dont feel like eating, talk with a dietitian or health care professional to make sure you are getting enough calories and that the calories are from nutritious sources. Your dietitian or health care professional can help you find healthy ways to get the calories your body needs. Choose heart-healthy foods You may protect your heart health and lower your chance of developing heart and blood vessel disease by replacing saturated fats and trans fats in your diet with healthier unsaturated fats, which include monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats. Monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fatsfound in foods such as canola oil, safflower oil, avocados, nuts, and seedsare healthy alternatives to saturated fats and trans fats. Saturated fats and trans fats can raise cholesterol levels and clog blood vessels. Saturated fats, which are found in animal products such as red meat, poultry, and butter, are usually solid at room temperature. Trans fats can be found in fast foods, fried foods, commercially produced baked goods, and other foods cooked with partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated oil or shortening. Tips for following a heart-healthy diet include Choose heart-healthy foods NIH external link, including plenty of fruits and vegetables. Grill, broil, bake, roast, air-fry, or stir-fry foods, instead of deep-frying. Cook with nonstick cooking spray or a small amount of olive oil instead of butter. Trim fat from meat and remove skin from poultry before eating. Limit saturated and trans fats. Look for the amount of saturated fat External link and trans fat External link on the Nutrition Facts label. Limit alcohol. Ask your health care professional how much alcohol is safe for you. Talk with your dietitian or health care professional about healthy ways you can include fat in your diet External link. Track your liquids You may need to adjust how much liquid you have each day, depending on your kidney function. A dietitian or health care professional can work with you to determine how much liquid you should have each day. Contact your health care professional if you notice any swelling in your face, arms, legs, or abdomen. Choose foods and drinks with less phosphorus Phosphorus is found naturally in foods that are rich in protein, such as meat, dairy products, and beans. Phosphorus is also added to many foods. Phosphorus additives are the primary source of phosphorus for many people. Tips to reduce phosphorus in your diet include Limit or avoid packaged and processed foods and drinks that have added phosphorus, such as deli meats, flavored drinks, and other processed foods. Check Nutrition Facts labels External link for added phosphorus. Look for phosphorus or words with PHOS, such as phosphoric acid, disodium phosphate, and monosodium phosphate on the ingredient list.",
    "Check Nutrition Facts labels External link for added phosphorus. Look for phosphorus or words with PHOS, such as phosphoric acid, disodium phosphate, and monosodium phosphate on the ingredient list. Eat larger portions of fruits and vegetables, which are naturally low in phosphorus, and smaller portions of foods high in phosphorus. Keep in mind, your body absorbs more phosphorus from animal-based foods, such as meat and poultry, than from plant-based foods, such as beans and seeds. Some packaged meats and poultry have added phosphorus. Ask someone who works in the meat department to show you which meats do not have added phosphorus. A health care professional can check your blood phosphorus level using a blood test NIH external link. Foods and drinks with added phosphorus may cause your blood phosphorus level to go up more than foods and drinks that naturally contain phosphorus. Your dietitian or health care professional may suggest changes to what you eat and drink to help keep your phosphorus level in a healthy range. As kidney disease advances, you may need to take a phosphate binder with meals to lower the amount of phosphorus in your blood. A phosphate binder is a medicine that acts like a sponge to soak up, or bind, phosphorus while it is in the stomach. Because it is bound, the phosphorus does not get into your blood. Instead, your body removes the phosphorus through your stool. Choose foods that help keep your potassium level in the goal range Your food and drink choices can help you keep your potassium level in a healthy range. If your potassium level is high, your health care professional may recommend you Limit serving sizes of foods that contain potassium. Keep in mind that a large serving of a lower-potassium food may have more potassium than a small serving of a higher-potassium food. Use spices and herbs instead of salt substitutes, which can be high in potassium. Limit foods with potassium chloride on the ingredient list. Potassium chloride is sometimes used in place of salt in some packaged foods. Drain canned fruits and vegetables and throw out the liquid, which is often high in potassium. Use food preparation and cooking methods, such as boiling and leaching, that can lower the amount of potassium in certain vegetables. If you have diabetes and your blood glucose levelalso called blood sugar levelgets low, choose apple, grape, or cranberry juice instead of other fruit juices that are higher in potassium, such as orange juice. A health care professional can check your potassium level using a blood test NIH external link. Talk with your dietitian or health care professional about ways you can adjust your food and drink choices to meet your potassium goal. Your health care professional may suggest you take a potassium binder to lower the amount of potassium in your blood. Similar to phosphate binders, potassium binders are medicines that prevent some potassium from getting into the blood. The potassium is removed from the body through your stool.",

Similar to phosphate binders, potassium binders are medicines that prevent some potassium from getting into the blood. The potassium is removed from the body through your stool. Taking certain medicines, as well as skipping dialysis treatments, can also raise your potassium level. Your health care professional may adjust the medicines you take if your potassium level is too high. If you receive dialysis treatments, be sure to attend all dialysis sessions to help prevent potassium from building up in your blood. A grandfather has dinner with his daughter and granddaughter. Talk with your dietitian or health care professional about changes you can make to what you eat and drink if your CKD gets worse. Choose the amount and types of protein your body needs Protein is in many foods you eat, including foods from plants and animals. You may need to adjust the amount of protein in your diet to help keep your kidneys healthier longer. Your protein needs may also change over time. Work with your dietitian or health care professional to find the amount and sources of protein External link you should include in your diet. Your health care professional may recommend you limit how much meat and dairy foods you consume get the rest of your protein from plant-based foods choose lean, or low-fat, meats that also are low in phosphorus If you dont eat animal products, eat a variety of plant-based proteins to meet your bodys protein needs. People with CKD who are on dialysis may need to eat more protein because the dialysis treatment removes protein from the blood. The amount of protein removed from the blood depends on the type of dialysis treatment. For example, peritoneal dialysis removes more protein than hemodialysis. A variety of animaland plant-based proteins on a cutting board. Talk with your dietitian or health care professional about the amount and sources of protein you should include in your diet. Choose and prepare foods with less salt and sodium Most Americans consume more sodium than they should. Much of this sodium comes from packaged, prepared, and restaurant foods, not from a saltshaker. Even foods that dont taste salty can be high in sodium. Canned foods, some frozen foods, and most processed meats contain large amounts of salt. Snack foods such as chips and crackers are also high in salt. Table salt, some seasonings, ketchup, mustard, and certain sauces such as barbecue, soy, and teriyaki sauces are high in sodium. The 20202025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans External link recommends adults limit their sodium to no more than 2, 300 milligrams per day. 1 Many people with CKD need to limit their sodium even more. Your health care professional can determine your sodium limit, based on your kidney health.

Check for sodium on the Nutrition Facts label External link of food packages. A % Daily Value External link of 20% or more means the food is high in sodium, and a value of 5% or less means the food is low in sodium. Look for foods labeled sodium free, salt free, very low sodium, low sodium, reduced or less sodium, no salt added, unsalted, or lightly salted. Eat more fresh, frozen, and canned fruits and vegetables without added sauce, seasonings, sodium, or salt. Drain and rinse canned vegetables, beans, meats, and fish with water to remove extra salt. Cook foods from scratch. When you prepare your own food, you control what goes into it. Use spices, herbs, and sodium-free seasonings in place of salt. Use alternative seasonings, such as lemon juice, herbs, and hot peppers. Try slowly reducing the amount of sodium in your diet over time. Your taste buds will gradually adjust, and you wont notice the change in flavor. A Nutrition Facts label highlighting serving size, number of servings, and percent daily value for sodium. There may be more than one serving in the package, so be sure to check serving size. Percent daily value for sodium tells you how much sodium in one serving contributes to a daily diet of 2, 000 calories. Look for the serving size and sodium on the Nutrition Facts label. A label showing % Daily Value (%DV) of 5% or less per serving is considered low in sodium. What is medical nutrition therapy? Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is nutrition counseling from a registered dietitian to help meet your medical or health goals. MNT can help delay CKD progression, prevent or treat complications, and improve your quality of life. Medicare and insurance coverage for MNT If you are enrolled in Medicare and have CKD, Medicare will cover MNT services External link. You will need a written referral from a doctor, and the MNT must be provided by a registered dietitian. If you have health insurance, check your insurance companys website or call customer service to find out if your insurance will pay for some or all MNT. If you dont have insurance or Medicare, ask a health care professional about the cost of a dietitians services. A health care professional may be able to connect you with organizations that can help cover the cost of nutrition counseling.

Diabetes and Kidney Disease: What to Eat? What to know About 1 in 3 American adults with diabetes also has chronic kidney disease (CKD). Figuring out what to eat can be a major challenge. Diabetes and CKD diets share many of the same foods, but there are some important differences. Read on for the basics. Woman eating edamame Diabetes diet A healthy diabetes diet looks pretty much like a healthy diet for anyone. Eat lots of fruits, veggies, healthy fats, and lean protein. Eat less salt, sugar, and foods high in refined carbs (cookies, crackers, and soda, just to name a few). Your individual carb goal is based on your age, activity level, any medicines you take, and other factors. Following your meal plan will help keep blood sugar levels in your target range. This will also prevent more damage to your kidneys. Kidney diet With a CKD diet, youll avoid or limit certain foods to protect your kidneys. Youll include other foods to give you energy and keep you nourished. Your specific diet will depend on whether youre in early-stage or late-stage CKD or if youre on dialysis. Foods to limit Eat less salt/sodium. Over time, your kidneys lose the ability to control your sodium-water balance. Less sodium in your diet will help lower blood pressure. It will also decrease fluid buildup in your body, which is common in kidney disease. Focus on fresh, homemade food to better control the amount of sodium in your food. Eat only small amounts of restaurant food and packaged food, which usually have lots of sodium. Look for low sodium (5% or less) on food labels. In a week or two, youll get used to less salt in your food. Add flavor with herbs, spices, mustard, and flavored vinegars.",
    "Eat only small amounts of restaurant food and packaged food, which usually have lots of sodium. Look for low sodium (5% or less) on food labels. In a week or two, youll get used to less salt in your food. Add flavor with herbs, spices, mustard, and flavored vinegars. But dont use salt substitutes unless your doctor or dietitian says you can. Many are very high in potassium, which you may need to limit. Depending on your kidney disease stage, you may also need to reduce the potassium, phosphorus, and protein in your diet. Many foods that are part of a typical healthy diet may not be right for a CKD diet. Phosphorus is a mineral that keeps your bones strong and other parts of your body healthy. Your kidneys cant remove extra phosphorus from your blood very well. Too much weakens bones and can damage your blood vessels, eyes, and heart. Meat, dairy, beans, nuts, whole-grain bread, and dark-colored sodas are high in phosphorus. Phosphorus is also added to lots of packaged foods. The right level of potassium keeps your nerves and muscles working well. With CKD, too much potassium can build up in your blood and cause serious heart problems. Oranges, potatoes, tomatoes, whole-grain bread, and many other foods are high in potassium. Apples, carrots, and white bread are lower in potassium. Your doctor may prescribe a potassium binder, a medicine that helps your body get rid of extra potassium. Eat the right amount of protein. More protein than you need makes your kidneys work harder and may make CKD worse. But too little isnt healthy either. Both animal and plant foods have protein. Your dietitian can help you figure out the right combination and amount of protein to eat. Say no to herbal supplements Herbal supplements arent safe if you have kidney disease. Some can hurt your kidneys and even make kidney disease worse. Some vitamins can cause kidney problems too and should also be avoided. Always talk to your doctor before taking any supplements or vitamins. Diabetes and CKD foods Below are just a few examples of foods a person with both diabetes and CKD can eat. Your dietitian can give you more suggestions and help you find recipes for tasty meals: Fruits: berries, grapes, cherries, apples, plums Veggies: cauliflower, onions, eggplant, turnips Proteins: lean meats (poultry, fish), eggs, unsalted seafood Carbs: white bread, bagels, sandwich buns, unsalted crackers, pasta Drinks: water, clear diet sodas, unsweetened tea Heres one way your CKD diet and diabetes diet can work together. If you drink orange juice to treat low blood sugar, switch to kidney-friendly apple or grape juice. Youll get the same blood-sugar boost with a lot less potassium. Late-stage CKD Your nutrition needs will change with late-stage CKD. If youre on dialysis, you may need to eat more, especially more protein. Your appetite can change because food tastes different. Dialysis filters your blood like kidneys do, but it doesnt work as well as healthy kidneys.",
    "Late-stage CKD Your nutrition needs will change with late-stage CKD. If youre on dialysis, you may need to eat more, especially more protein. Your appetite can change because food tastes different. Dialysis filters your blood like kidneys do, but it doesnt work as well as healthy kidneys. Fluid can build up in your body between treatments. You may need to limit how much fluid you drink. Youll need to watch for swelling around your eyes or in your legs, arms, or belly. Your blood sugar levels can actually get better with late-stage CKD. This may happen because of changes in how your body uses insulin. But when youre on dialysis, your blood sugar can increase. This is because the fluid used to filter your blood is high in glucose (sugar). Your need for insulin and other diabetes medicines will be hard to predict, so your doctor will monitor you closely. When you have kidney disease, it is important to watch what you eat and drink because your kidneys cannot remove waste products as well as they should. A kidney-friendly eating plan can help you stay healthier and slow down damage to your kidneys. This webpage is for people who have Stages 1 to 4 of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and are not on dialysis. Everyone is different and has different nutritional needs. Use this information as a guide. Work with a dietitian to create a kidney-friendly eating plan that is right for you. What is a kidney-friendly eating plan? A kidney-friendly eating plan is a way of eating that helps you stay healthy and can slow down damage to your kidneys. It includes foods that are easy on your kidneys and limits other foods and fluids so certain minerals in those foods, like potassium, do not build up to high levels in your body. How can I create a kidney-friendly eating plan that is right for me? Ask your doctor to refer you to a dietitian (someone with special training in food and nutrition to know which foods are right for people with kidney disease). You can talk to a dietitian about the foods you enjoy or any special requirements you have (for example, you are vegetarian or have food allergies) and they will help you create a kidney-friendly eating plan that is right for you and includes the foods you enjoy. Always talk to a dietitian before increasing or decreasing your daily intake of certain foods or nutrients. Medicare and many private insurance plans pay for a certain number of visits with a dietitian each year. Call your insurance company to ask if your plan covers medical nutrition therapy (MNT) with a dietitian. MNT is an approach to treat kidney disease through a tailored nutrition plan. As part of MNT, a dietitian will review your current eating habits, create a healthy eating plan, that includes your preferences, and help you overcome eating challenges.",

As part of MNT, a dietitian will review your current eating habits, create a healthy eating plan, that includes your preferences, and help you overcome eating challenges. Learn more about working with a dietitian to create and following a kidney-friendly eating plan Why is a kidney-friendly eating plan important? A kidney-friendly eating plan helps you manage your kidney disease and slow down damage to your kidneys. It does this by preventing certain minerals from building up in your body, which is important because your kidneys do not work as well to remove waste products from your body. A kidney-friendly eating plan can also help prevent other serious health problems and controls high blood pressure and diabetes, which can prevent kidney disease from getting worse. It also ensures that you get the right balance of nutrients to help you: Have energy to do your daily tasks Prevent infection Build muscle Stay at a healthy weight How can I follow a kidney-friendly eating plan? Your kidney-friendly eating plan may change over time but will always give you the right amount of key nutrients. Protein: One of the nutrients that gives you energy. Your body needs protein to grow, build muscles, heal and stay healthy. Fat: Fat is another one of the nutrients that gives you energy. Your body needs fat to carry out many jobs, such as using vitamins from your food and keep your body at the right temperature. Carbohydrates or carbs: Your bodys main source of energy. Your body can more easily convert carbs into energy than protein and fat. Work with your dietitian to follow the steps below for a kidney-friendly eating plan. Eat the right amount and the right types of protein Having too little protein can cause your skin, hair and nails to be weak. But having too much protein can make your kidneys work harder and cause more damage. This happens because when your body uses protein, it makes waste products that your kidneys must filter. To stay healthy and help you feel your best, you may need to adjust how much protein you eat. The amount of protein you should eat depends on your body size, activity level and health. Your doctor and dietitian may have you limit protein or change the type of protein you eat. For example, you may need to eat more lean proteins, which are foods that are high in protein and low in fat, such as whole eggs and skinless chicken and turkey. Ask your doctor and dietitian how much protein you should eat and what the best types of protein are for you. Choose the right types of fat Fat gives you energy and helps you use some of the vitamins in your food. You need some fat in your eating plan to stay healthy. Too much fat can lead to weight gain and heart disease.",
    "Choose the right types of fat Fat gives you energy and helps you use some of the vitamins in your food. You need some fat in your eating plan to stay healthy. Too much fat can lead to weight gain and heart disease. Limit fat in your meal plan, and choose healthier fats when you can, such as olive oil. Choosing the right types of fat is also part of a heart-healthy eating plan called DASH. Choose whole grain carbohydrates Eating too many carbs can lead to weight gain. When you have kidney disease, it is best to choose whole grains and healthy carbs such as fruits and vegetables. Unhealthy carbs include sugar, honey, hard candies, soft drinks and other sugary drinks. If you have diabetes, you may also need to carefully track how many carbs you take in. Your dietitian can help you learn more about the carbs in your eating plan and how they affect your blood sugar. The ketogenic diet or keto diet is a type of low-carb diet that focuses on eating very low carbs, high fats and moderate protein amounts, so your body uses stored fat for energy instead of carbs. This diet may not be a healthy option for you because it limits your options, and you may miss out on some key nutrients. If you have questions about a specific diet, ask your dietitian. Eat the right amount of calories Calories are like fuel and give your body energy. Calories come from the protein, fat and carbs in your food and fluid plan. How many calories you need depends on your age, gender, body size and activity level. You may need to adjust how many calories you eat to stay at a healthy weight. Some people will need to limit the calories they eat. Others may need to have more calories. Your doctor and dietitian can help you figure out how many calories you should have each day. Choose and prepare foods with less sodium (salt) Sodium (salt) is a mineral found in almost all foods. It has many important roles in the way your body works. The amount of sodium found naturally in foods is enough to keep a healthy level in your body. But eating packaged foods and adding salt to foods can lead to eating too much sodium. Too much sodium can make you thirsty and make your body hold onto water, which can lead to swelling and raise your blood pressure. This can damage your kidneys more and make your heart work harder. One of the best things you can do is to limit how much sodium you eat. Here are some tips to limit sodium: Use herbs and spices for flavor while cooking. Do not add salt to your food when cooking or eating. Choose fresh or frozen vegetables instead of canned vegetables. If you use canned vegetables, drain and rinse them to remove extra salt.",
    "Here are some tips to limit sodium: Use herbs and spices for flavor while cooking. Do not add salt to your food when cooking or eating. Choose fresh or frozen vegetables instead of canned vegetables. If you use canned vegetables, drain and rinse them to remove extra salt. When eating out, ask your server to have the chef not add salt to your dish. Work with your dietitian to find foods that are low in sodium. Healthy eating can look different depending on your stage of kidney disease. Learn more about healthy eating for your specific stage: Stages 1 and 2 Stages 3, 4 and 5 (not on dialysis) Kidney failure (on dialysis) Kidney transplant Find delicious kidney-friendly recipes Kidney Kitchen is home to hundreds of kidney-friendly recipes that cover a wide variety of tastes, cuisines and dietary preferen Start cooking How to control portion sizes? Good portion control or watching how much you eat is important in a kidney-friendly eating plan, because you may need to limit how much of certain things you eat and drink. To help control your portion sizes: Read the nutrition label to learn the serving size and how much of each nutrient is in one serving. Many packages have more than one serving. For example, a 20-ounce bottle of soda is two-and-a-half servings. For foods that do not have nutrition labels, such as fruits and vegetables, ask your dietitian for a list of nutrition facts to measure the right portions. Eat slowly and stop eating when you are full. It takes about 20 minutes for your stomach to tell your brain that you are full. If you eat too quickly, you may eat more than you need. Avoid eating while doing something else, such as watching TV or driving. When you are distracted, you may not realize how much you have eaten. Will my kidney-friendly eating plan change based on my stage of CKD? Yes, how strict your eating plan should be depends on your stage of kidney disease. When you are in the early stages of CKD (Stages 1 and 2), you will have less limits on what you can eat. As your kidney disease gets worse (Stages 3, 4 and 5), your doctor may recommend that you limit: Potassium: A mineral found in foods that your body needs to make your muscles work. Phosphorus: A mineral found in foods that works with calcium and vitamin D to keep your bones healthy. Fluids: Anything that turns to liquid at room temperature, not just water. Choose foods with the right amount of potassium When your kidneys are not working well, your potassium level may be too high or too low. Having too much or too little potassium can cause muscle cramps, problems with the way your heart beats and muscle weakness. If you have kidney disease, your doctor or dietitian may tell you to lower the amount of potassium in your eating plan.",
    "Having too much or too little potassium can cause muscle cramps, problems with the way your heart beats and muscle weakness. If you have kidney disease, your doctor or dietitian may tell you to lower the amount of potassium in your eating plan. Use the lists below to learn about foods that are low or high in potassium. Foods low in potassium Apples, cranberries, grapes, pineapples and strawberries Cauliflower, onions, peppers, radishes, summer squash and lettuce Pita, tortillas and white breads Beef and chicken White rice Foods high in potassium Avocados, bananas, melons, oranges, prunes and raisins Artichokes, winter squash, plantains, spinach, potatoes and tomatoes Bran products and granola Beans (baked, black, pinto, etc. ) Brown or wild rice Limit phosphorus Healthy kidneys keep the right amount of phosphorus in your body. When your kidneys are not working well, phosphorus can build up in your blood. Too much phosphorus in your blood can lead to weak bones that break easily. Ask your doctor and dietitian if you need to limit phosphorus. They may also prescribe a medicine called a phosphate binder, which prevents your body from absorbing phosphorus from foods you eat. Use the lists below to learn how to replace high phosphorus foods with low phosphorus alternatives. Eat these low phosphorus foods Italian, French or sourdough bread Corn or rice cereals and cream of wheat Unsalted popcorn Some light-colored sodas and lemonade Avoid these high phosphorus foods Whole-grain bread Bran cereals and oatmeal Nuts and sunflower seeds Dark-colored colas Limit fluid When you have kidney disease, you may need to limit water and fluids. This is because damaged kidneys do not get rid of extra fluid as well as they should. Too much fluid in your body can cause high blood pressure, swelling and heart failure. To limit fluids, you will need to cut back on how much you drink and limit eating some foods that contain a lot of water, such as soups, ice cream, gelatin and many fruits and vegetables. If you need to limit fluids, here are some tips: Measure your fluids Drink from small cups to help you keep track of how much you had to drink Limit sodium (salt) to help you feel less thirsty When you feel thirsty: Chew gum Rinse your mouth with water and spit it out Suck on a piece of ice, mints or sugar-free hard candy Will my eating plan be different if I have diabetes? If you have diabetes, you need to control your blood sugar to prevent more damage to your kidneys. Your doctor and dietitian can help you create an eating plan that helps you control your blood sugar, while also limiting sodium, phosphorus, potassium and fluids. You can also ask your doctor to refer you to a diabetes educator who can work with you to better manage your diabetes. Will I get enough vitamins on a kidney-friendly eating plan? Your doctor and dietitian can help you find vitamins that are right for you.",
    "You can also ask your doctor to refer you to a diabetes educator who can work with you to better manage your diabetes. Will I get enough vitamins on a kidney-friendly eating plan? Your doctor and dietitian can help you find vitamins that are right for you. To help you get the right amounts of vitamins and minerals, your dietitian may suggest you take: A special supplement made for people with kidney disease. A special kind of vitamin D, folic acid or iron pill, to help prevent some common side effects of kidney disease, such as bone disease and anemia. Regular multi-vitamins may not be healthy for you if you have kidney disease. Tell your doctor and dietitian about any vitamins, supplements or over-the-counter medicines you are taking. Some can cause more damage to your kidneys or cause other health problems. Healthy eating for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stages 1 to 3 What is CKD Chronic Kidney disease is a long term condition where the kidneys do not work well. It does not usually cause symptoms until later stages. CKD is normally found at earlier stages by blood and urine tests. Your GP can tell you what stage of kidney disease you have. This information is for people who have early-stage CKD. If you have late CKD you will see a specialist kidney (nephrology) team with a kidney Dietitian. More information about CKD can be found here: How does a healthy diet help my kidneys? Healthy eating is good for everyone. Some aspects are especially important for people with early-stage CKD. One of our kidneys jobs is to get rid of the waste products from food breakdown. When you have CKD, your kidneys are not able to do this well. A healthy diet makes less waste and puts less stress on the kidneys. Healthy eating can help manage diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure. Controlling these conditions can help protect the kidneys too. The information in this leaflet is suitable for you if you are living with diabetes, obesity or high blood pressure. Read more to find out how to eat well for your kidneys and overall health. What is a healthy diet? A healthy diet has a good balance of different foods and nutrients each day to keep you healthy and well. Healthy eating is not about restricting your intake. It is about choosing a variety of different foods each day; in the amounts you need to keep you well. The Eatwell Guide helps to explain what a healthy diet looks like. You can find more information about the Eatwell Guide here: Eat more of these: Fruit and vegetables are a key part of healthy eating. They provide vitamins, minerals and fibre to keep you and your kidneys well. Aim to enjoy 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day, or more if you can. Choose a variety to ensure you get different vitamins. This can be from fresh, frozen, dried or canned fruit and vegetables.",
    "They provide vitamins, minerals and fibre to keep you and your kidneys well. Aim to enjoy 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day, or more if you can. Choose a variety to ensure you get different vitamins. This can be from fresh, frozen, dried or canned fruit and vegetables. One portion is approximately one handful Starchy foods like bread, potatoes, pasta, rice and other grains are part of a healthy diet. These foods are a key source of energy for the body. If you can, choose wholegrain products like wholemeal bread, brown rice, wholewheat pasta, oats and potatoes with skins on to ensure you get more fibre, and vitamins. Beans, lentils, chickpeas and other pulses provide protein. They are also high in fibre and low in less healthy fats. Regularly replacing some of your meat with these pulses may help to slow the loss of kidney function. Eat some of these: Animal protein foods like fish, eggs, meat, milk, yoghurt and cheese provide a range of vitamins and minerals. They can be part of a healthy diet when eaten in moderate amounts. However, it is best to eat more plant sources of protein such as lentils, pulses, legumes, tofu or nuts and less meat, especially red meat. Oily fish like salmon, mackerel or sardines provide a source of omega-3 (a healthy fat). Enjoy one portion of fish per week. Or you can obtain Omega-3 from rapeseed oil, walnuts or seeds (hemp, chia or flax/linseeds). Dairy foods provide protein, calcium, B vitamins and iodine. It is best to go for lower fat and lower sugar versions (for example natural yoghurt) most of the time. If you use a plant-based-dairy alternative, choose one that is fortified with calcium. It is best to limit plant milks and dairy alternatives (such as yoghurt) to 300 ml (half a pint) a day if they have phosphate additives listed in the ingredients. Eat small amounts of these: We need fats and oils in small amounts. It is best to choose fats like olive oil, nut, seed or healthy vegetable oils, such as rape seed oil. Limit less healthy fats such as coconut and palm oil, butter, lard and ghee. If you can, it is best to keep processed foods to a minimum. Foods that are pre-packed, or have added fat, salt, sugar and / or additives are processed. Ready meals are processed. This also includes meats or fish that are salted, cured, smoked, coated, breaded or battered. Eat less of these: Food or drinks that are high in less healthy fats, salt and sugar are best eaten only occasionally. These items include chocolate, cakes, biscuits, pastry, crisps, fried chips and sugary drinks. Try to keep portion sizes small. Note: it is advisable to avoid star fruit. Star fruit has a toxin that can build-up in the body and become harmful to those with kidney disease. Reducing salt: Reducing salt is helpful for everyone with CKD. Most of us eat more salt than we should.",
    "Note: it is advisable to avoid star fruit. Star fruit has a toxin that can build-up in the body and become harmful to those with kidney disease. Reducing salt: Reducing salt is helpful for everyone with CKD. Most of us eat more salt than we should. Salt is added to many foods before we buy them as part of the food manufacturing process, Eating salt and salty foods increases your blood pressure. Limiting the amount of salty foods, you can eat can help keep blood pressure under control and reduce further damage to kidneys. Salt can also make you thirsty and makes fluid retention worse. It is recommended to have less than 5g (one teaspoon) salt per day. Most of this salt is likely to be naturally occurring in the foods you eat. Your taste buds will adapt to less salt, but this may take about 3 weeks. Tips to reduce salt include: If you can, limit processed or convenience foods and takeaways. If you do eat these, check labels and choose versions that are lower in salt. Cook meals from scratch wherever possible Try not to add salt in cooking or at the table. This includes all types of salt, e. g. Lo Salt or other lower sodium salts, rock salt, sea salt, Himalayan pink salt, garlic and kosher salts etc. Salt substitutes such as Lo-salt or other low sodium salts contain a lot of potassium and are not always suitable for people with kidney disease. Use reduced salt stock cubes in your cooking, rather than standard cubes. These are available in most supermarkets. Flavour food using a variety of fresh or dried herbs, spices, garlic, ginger, onions, vinegars, lemon or lime juice. Be careful with seasoning mixes as these can contain a lot of salt. Understanding food labels: Reading and understanding food labels can look complicated and time consuming, but gets easier with practice. If you shop online, this information is available on the supermarket websites. Having less salt: Some foods may be labelled reduced salt but could still be quite high in salt. Remember to look at the Traffic Light Symbol on the front of the packaging. It will look something like this. Choose foods that are green or amber for salt. Have less of these that are coloured red. If there is no traffic light symbol, check the nutritional information on the back of food packaging. This may tell you the amount of salt per 100 g of the product, or per portion. If the label provides the salt per 100 g, compare with the table below Per 100g Low Medium High Salt 0-0. 3g 0. 3-1. 5g More than 1. 5g If the food label only says how much is in a portion, consider how much of that food you are planning to eat. The manufacturers portion size might be different from yours. Check the portion size on the label and compare it to your own.",
    "5g More than 1. 5g If the food label only says how much is in a portion, consider how much of that food you are planning to eat. The manufacturers portion size might be different from yours. Check the portion size on the label and compare it to your own. Picking a larger or smaller portion can have a big impact on the amount of salt you consume. Phosphate: Avoiding phosphate additives in your food can be helpful if you have CKD. Too much phosphate from additives can be harmful to your heart, kidneys, and bones. Many processed foods contain phosphate additives. The good news is you can usually find a similar product without these additives. You can check in the ingredients list on the label. Most people find the easiest way is to look for phosp as part of a word on the list. However, sometimes a label only shows E numbers. Here is a list of E numbers to watch out for. Some people find it useful to carry a credit card-sized list while shopping, or you can save the numbers on your phone. Cooking from scratch more often will help to reduce the amount of additives you eat. Note: You can enjoy foods that naturally contain phosphates unless your kidney care team tells you otherwise. Our bodies dont absorb natural phosphates as easily as phosphate additives. If you need guidance on your diet, a kidney Dietitian will assist you in choosing the right foods, including those without additives. E338 Phosphoric acid E339 Sodium phosphates E340 Potassium phosphates E341 Calcium phosphates E343 Magnesium phosphates E450 Diphosphates E451 Triphosphates E452 Polyphosphates Special Diets Many people with CKD wont need to follow special diets. However, those with more advanced CKD may be advised to make changes to their potassium, phosphates, protein, or fluid intake. The advice you receive about limiting these nutrients will depend on your CKD stage, blood results, medications, and how you like to eat. If youve been told to make dietary changes, a kidney Dietitian can help you create a healthy, balanced and enjoyable diet while taking your condition in to account. You should not restrict your diet unless you have been advised by your Kidney Doctor or Dietitian to do so. Poor Appetite If youre in the advanced stages of CKD and find yourself often not feeling hungry, its a good idea to speak with to a kidney Dietitian. They can provide assistance for issues like not wanting to eat much, changes in taste, feeling sick, vomiting or losing weight without meaning to. Vitamin and mineral supplements If you are eating well and enjoying a varied diet, there is no need to take a vitamin and mineral supplement. If you do want to take a supplement or herbal remedy, discuss this with your kidney Doctor first. They can help to ensure it is safe to take. Other lifestyle guidance Alcohol General guidance is to try not to exceed 14 units of alcohol each week.",
    "If you do want to take a supplement or herbal remedy, discuss this with your kidney Doctor first. They can help to ensure it is safe to take. Other lifestyle guidance Alcohol General guidance is to try not to exceed 14 units of alcohol each week. If you do drink, spread your drinking evenly over three or more days and have several alcohol-free days per week (always check alcohol consumption is safe with your medication). Exercise Staying active is key to staying healthy. Exercise not only strengthens your bones and muscles but also helps you manage your weight, blood pressure, and diabetes. Aim to do 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity each week. For example, you can take a 30-minute walk five times a week. However, any exercise is better than none at all. Start slowly and gradually increase your activity based on your current fitness. Smoking If you currently smoke, then it is advisable to stop. There are special services to help you stop smoking. You can find out more about this at your GP practice. Summary Enjoy a varied healthy diet, rich in vegetables, fruits, wholegrains and pulses each day. Eat regularly and try not to miss meals. Eat less salt, foods that are high in salt and processed foods. Check food labels to cut down your intake of phosphate additives. Good control of blood pressure, diabetes and keeping to a wealthy weight are helpful to slow the progression of your CKD down. Discuss any over the counter supplements with your kidney Doctor before taking them. Only follow a special diet for your kidneys if you have been advised to by your kidney Doctor or Dietitian.

CKD Kidney Dietitian Directory Nutrients to manage in chronic kidney disease People with CKD may need to control the amount or type of one or more nutrients: Sodium Potassium Phosphorus Calcium Protein Eating the right amount or type of one or more of these nutrients may help control the buildup of waste and fluid in your blood. This means your kidneys do not have to work as hard to remove the extra waste and fluid. If your kidney disease gets worse, you may need to limit other nutrients as well. Your dietitian or healthcare provider will tell you if you need to do this based on your blood test results. Sodium and your CKD Diet: How to Spice Up Your Cooking Healthy kidneys control how much sodium is in your body. If your kidneys do not work well, too much sodium can cause fluid buildup, swelling, higher blood pressure, and strain on your heart. Your dietitian or healthcare provider can tell you the right amount of sodium you should have each day. Potassium Potassium is important for muscle function, including the heart muscle. Too much or too little potassium in the blood can be very dangerous. The amount of potassium you need is based on how well your kidneys are working and your medications. Your dietitian or healthcare provider can tell you about foods with potassium and the right amount for you to eat each day. Potassium from animal foods is absorbed at a higher rate than potassium from plants. Elevated blood sugars can also increase potassium levels. Some high-potassium foods include milk, meat, bananas, oranges and orange juice, cantaloupe, dried fruits, winter squash and salt substitutes. Phosphorus and Your Diet As kidney function gets lower, extra phosphorus can start building up in the blood. High phosphorus levels can cause bones to get weaker. Your dietitian or healthcare provider can tell you if you need to limit goods that are high in phosphorus. High phosphorus foods include dairy products, organ meats, colas, deli meats, and processed foods with phosphate additives. Avoid processed foods that have additives with PHOS like disodium PHOSphate. You can find these additives in the ingredients list on food labels. Calcium Foods that are good sources of calcium are often high in phosphorus. Your dietitian or healthcare provider will tell you if you need to limit calcium. Before taking any over-the-counter vitamin D or calcium supplements, talk to your healthcare provider. Protein Your body needs protein to help build muscle, repair tissue, and fight infection. Plant-based protein like beans and nuts are easier on the kidneys than animal proteins like meat and dairy products. This is because plant proteins produce less acid in the body than meat proteins. More acid in body can damage the kidneys.",
    "Plant-based protein like beans and nuts are easier on the kidneys than animal proteins like meat and dairy products. This is because plant proteins produce less acid in the body than meat proteins. More acid in body can damage the kidneys. Having very large amounts of protein, especially in the form of unnecessary supplements, can be stressful on the kidneys. But if protein intake is too low, you can lose muscle mass, become weak, and increase the bodys acid load, so it is important to eat the right amount each day. The amount of protein you need is based on: Your weight Your age growing children and adolescents, and older people, need more protein The amount of protein in your urine, and depending on your type of kidney disease Your dietitian or healthcare provider can tell you how much protein you should eat. Fluids The Dos and Donts of Fluid Management in Chronic Kidney Disease Most people in the early stages of kidney disease do not need to limit how much fluid they drink. If you do not know your stage of kidney disease, ask your healthcare provider. If your kidney disease worsens, your dietitian or healthcare provider can let you know if you need to limit fluids and how much to drink each day. Fluids may need to be limited based on how much urine you make each day, and if fluid build-up in your body is causing swelling or stress on your heart or lungs. Fluids include any food that is liquid at room temperature such as beverages, soups, gelatin, frozen desserts, and ice. Calories Every person is different in terms of the calories they need each day. Calories are like fuel. If you dont eat enough, your body will take protein from the muscles for energy. Its important to make sure you get the right number of calories. If you dont, you may get weak and damage your kidneys. Eating the right number of calories will: Help you stay at a healthy weight Give you the energy to do your daily tasks Help your body use the protein in food to build muscle and tissues Too many calories can cause extra weight gain, which can burden the kidneys. If you are overweight, some weight loss may be helpful. If weight loss is desired or you have diabetes, you should meet with a dietitian to set up a plan based on your kidney blood tests, current food choices, and daily activities. Vitamins and Minerals Vitamins and Minerals in Chronic Kidney Disease Most people get enough vitamins and minerals to stay healthy by eating a variety of foods each day. But kidney patients may need to limit some of these foods. If so, you may need to take special vitamin or mineral supplements, but only if a dietitian or healthcare provider tells you to. Some vitamins or mineral supplements may be harmful to people with kidney disease.",
    "But kidney patients may need to limit some of these foods. If so, you may need to take special vitamin or mineral supplements, but only if a dietitian or healthcare provider tells you to. Some vitamins or mineral supplements may be harmful to people with kidney disease. You should check with your healthcare provider before taking any medications you can buy without a prescription. Some supplements may be harmful to people with kidney disease. Over the counter vitamin and mineral supplements may contain too much phosphorous and potassium. You should also avoid taking herbal supplements. Good Fruits for Kidney Disease Managing Your CKD Diet Most fruits make for great additions to your kidney-friendly lifestyle because they are delicious, rich in fiber, low in sodium, and contain essential nutrients. The specific dietary needs for someone with chronic kidney disease (CKD) depend on multiple factors, so its important to have an idea of what fruits are good for people with kidney disease. As always, check with your doctor or dietitian about your specific needs. The Benefits of Fruits in a Kidney Disease Diet Fruits contain fiber, which has many health benefits, including improved gastrointestinal health. Additionally, people who consume high amounts of fiber tend to be at a lower risk for stroke, hypertension, coronary heart disease, obesity, and certain gastrointestinal diseases. 1 8 Great Fruits for Kidney Disease Diets Every fruit has a special set of qualitiesthey look and taste unique and offer different nutritional benefits. Understanding what each type of fruit provides will help you plan your kidney-friendly meals. Note that portion size is key for a kidney-friendly diet and, in general, a serving of fruit is equal to about one-half cup of raw fruit. Here are 8 tasty fruits to consider working into your CKD diet: Berries (all types): Low in potassium and high in antioxidants, fiber, and vitamin C, berries are low in sugar when they are consumed in modest portions, which can be beneficial for people with diabetes. Suggested recipe: Creamy Blueberry-Pecan Overnight Oatmeal Lemons and limes: Low in potassium and high in vitamin C, lemons and limes have a lower sugar content when consumed in a modest amount. They can be used in cooking instead of salt to bring out the natural flavors of a dish. Suggested recipe: Lemon Orzo Spring Salad Pineapples: Low in potassium, pineapples contain bromelain, a plant enzyme that has anti-inflammatory properties and may reduce swelling and pain in your joints. Suggested recipe: Vegan Smoothie Bowl Apples: Low in potassium and rich in fiber and vitamin C, apples also contain plant polyphenols, which are disease-fighting compounds found in plants. Suggested recipe: Apple and Cheddar with Jalapeño Slices Cherries: High in fiber and vitamin C and rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, cherries may also lessen the symptoms of gout, which can be a concern for people with CKD. 2 Grapes: High in vitamin K, grapes are also a good source of B vitamins like thiamine, riboflavin, and B6.",
    "2 Grapes: High in vitamin K, grapes are also a good source of B vitamins like thiamine, riboflavin, and B6. B vitamins can increase your energy. Watermelon: While most melons are high in potassium, watermelon is a low-potassium fruit. It is also high in vitamins A and C, magnesium, and lycopene, a powerful antioxidant. Watermelon can contribute a significant amount of natural sugar and fluid to your diet, so stick to a 1/2 cup serving if you are watching your fluid. Suggested recipe: Watermelon, Cucumber and Feta Salad Avocados: Although high in fiber, magnesium, and healthy monounsaturated fatswhich lower LDL cholesterolavocados should only be eaten in small portions because theyre high in potassium. Suggested Recipe: Egg Salad Avocado Toast The one fruit you should avoid is star fruitit contains a neurotoxin that can cause neurological problems and toxicity for people on dialysis. 3 Managing Potassium in Fruit Fruits sometimes get a bad rap because of their potassium content, which some people living with CKD have to limit. While some fruits do have high potassium, you can still enjoy many of them in small portions so you can benefit from their nutrients while keeping your potassium level under control. Your own potassium level will determine if you need to be more careful when selecting the best fruits for you. Incorporate Tasty Fruits Regularly into Your Diet Fruits make for healthy, tasty snacks and side dishes; they are an excellent source of fiber, vitamins, antioxidants, and nutrients, and should be included in your kidney-friendly meal plan. In addition to fruits, there are a number of great food choices that will help you feel your best. As with most foods, remain aware of your portions. Knowing how to balance your fruit intake will further allow you to experience their many health benefits. Talk to your renal dietitian or nephrologist for guidance on the right balance of fruit for your current diagnosis and treatment modality.

Anti-inflammatory properties and high fiber content, help improve kidney function. Grapes 1 cup of grapes contains 288 milligrams of potassium and 30 milligrams of phosphorus Good source of vitamins C and K (low levels of these vitamins are linked to kidney disease). High in fiber and contains small amounts of minerals like copper, manganese, and magnesium. Pineapples Low-potassium food option that helps lower blood pressure, which is a common complication of severe kidney disease. Contains bromelain, a digestive enzyme that helps dissolve kidney stones in the body. High in fiber and supports heart health (heart complications are common in people undergoing dialysis). Good source of vitamin C boost, which helps boost the immune system. Citrus fruits The more vitamin C in your diet, the better for your kidneys. Oranges, lemons, and other citrus fruits contain vitamin C in abundance. Consuming dilute lemon juice daily may help decrease the risk of kidney stone formation. Other fruits good for kidney health Other fruits that may be recommended for promoting kidney health include: Pears Peaches Clementines Nectarines Mandarins Plums Satsumas Watermelon Cherries How much fruit should you include in your diet? Since appropriate portion sizes vary from person to person, talk to your doctor or dietitian for recommendations on how much fruit to include in your diet to avoid consuming excessive amounts of these minerals. Which fruits are bad for the kidneys? When it comes to kidney health, fruits are on both sides of the fence. A person with renal illness should avoid high-potassium fruits. Bananas Bananas are high in potassium, with about 422 mg per medium-sized banana. As a result, if this fruit is a daily mainstay for people with chronic renal disease, maintaining a daily potassium intake of less than 2, 000 to 2, 500 mg may be difficult.",
    "Bananas Bananas are high in potassium, with about 422 mg per medium-sized banana. As a result, if this fruit is a daily mainstay for people with chronic renal disease, maintaining a daily potassium intake of less than 2, 000 to 2, 500 mg may be difficult. Oranges Although oranges and orange juice are loaded with antioxidants, they are high in potassium. Oranges and orange juice should be avoided or limited on a renal diet due to their high potassium level although they are best recognized for their vitamin C content. Grapes, apples, and cranberries are all suitable replacements for oranges. Dried fruits Dried fruits are not recommended for people with renal disease or diabetes because they contain a lot of sugar and minerals such as potassium. In reality, half a cup (65 grams) of dried apricots contains about 755 milligrams of potassium. Dried fruits are strong in fast-digesting sugar, which is undesirable if you have diabetes. Avocados Avocados are high in potassium. One avocado weighing about 200 grams contains 975 mg of potassium, almost half of the daily recommended amount for people with kidney disease. Kiwi Because kiwifruit contains a lot of oxalates, people who have kidney stones should avoid eating it. Furthermore, kiwifruits are high in potassium, which may be problematic for people with renal problems. Other fruits to avoid or limit for people with kidney disease Cantaloupe Honeydew Mangos Papaya Prune juice SLIDESHOW Kidney Stones: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment See Slideshow Why should you avoid high potassium food with kidney disease? Potassium levels are not well-regulated in kidney disease. Both the disease and some medications used to treat kidney disease may cause potassium buildup in the body. Hence, potassium intake should be reduced in a kidney disease diet. Many fruits, including melons, bananas, oranges, prunes, and tomatoes, are high in potassium. Fruit punches, canned and bottled fruit juices, and iced tea are harmful in people with kidney disease. Apples, grapes, and strawberries are low-potassium foods that are considered healthy options. High vs low-potassium foods list Low-potassium foods Apples Berries Fruit cocktail Grapes Lemon Peaches Canned pears Pineapple Plums Watermelon High-potassium fruits Avocados Bananas Cantaloupe Dried fruits Honeydew Kiwi Mangos Oranges and orange juice Papaya Prune juice Further tips Instead of bananas, oranges or kiwis, choose apples, berries, or grapes.

What fruits are good for stage 3 kidney disease? - Rebecca G, NJ All fruits and vegetables fit in a stage 3 CKD eating pattern. Usually, you have not been placed on a potassium restriction in stage 3. For meals its recommended that you have at least ½ your plate be vegetables and some fruits, ¼ of your plate whole grains and ¼ lean protein. For snacks: 1 small fruit with a small portion of protein (such as cheese, peanut butter, yogurt) to help keep you feeling full. Fruits are full of lots of different vitamins and minerals and eating a wide variety is important to help you get that benefit. We encourage fresh or frozen (not in syrup) fruits vs juice. By eating whole fruits, you also get the fiber which is missing in juice. It is easy to go a bit overboard with smaller fruits (grapes, tangerines, cut fruit) and juice. While you may eat too many calories when eating a larger portion of fruits, it still contains fiber and helps slow down the carbohydrate absorption vs drinking juice which doesnt have the fiber and could cause a spike in blood sugar. Also juice doesnt leave you feeling full as a piece of fruit, possibly you will end up eating something in addition which would add to your daily calorie intake. Some people need to avoid grapefruit and its juice because of medication if that is the case continue to avoid grapefruit. 10 Antioxidant Foods for the Kidney Diet Fresh, colorful and kidney-friendly fruits and vegetables arent just good; theyre good for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Powerful compounds called antioxidants found in certain foods may help protect you against other diseases such as cancer, heart disease, Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease.",
    "10 Antioxidant Foods for the Kidney Diet Fresh, colorful and kidney-friendly fruits and vegetables arent just good; theyre good for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Powerful compounds called antioxidants found in certain foods may help protect you against other diseases such as cancer, heart disease, Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease. Antioxidants neutralize harmful molecules in your body called free radicals, the normal yet damaging byproducts created when your body produces energy, fights infection or is exposed to toxins. Antioxidant vitamins A, C and E available in supplement form can be harmful to people on dialysis, though many take a renal vitamin supplement that contains 60-100 mg of vitamin C per day as recommended by their doctor. One of the best ways to get antioxidants is through food. Dietitians use colors in fruits and vegetables to identify antioxidants, which include: Red/Purple Anthocyanins, polyphenols, resveratrol Red Lycopene Orange Beta-carotene Orange/Yellow Cryptoxanthin, flavonoids Yellow/Green Lutein, zeaxanthin Green Indoles, sulforaphanes, lutein White/Green Allyl sulphides, quercetin Here are 10 colorful, high-antioxidant foods for the kidney diet. 1. Cranberries Cranberries add a distinctive zing to sweet breads, muffins and other recipes like Easy Cranberry Salad. Enjoy dried cranberries sprinkled on a salad or on their own as a snack. You can also drink cranberry juice or cranberry juice cocktail. 1/2 cup serving of raw cranberries 1 mg sodium, 40 mg potassium, 6 mg phosphorus 1/2 cup serving cranberry juice cocktail 3 mg sodium, 22 mg potassium, 3 mg phosphorus 1/2 cup serving dried cranberries 2 mg sodium, 24 mg potassium and 5 mg phosphorus 2. Plums Black plums are higher in antioxidants than red. Look for plums that have a fairly firm to slightly soft feel. Pit and freeze plums and add them to smoothies, purÃe them for Quick Fruit Sorbet or try Old-Fashioned Plum Cake. 1 medium plum 0 mg sodium, 104 mg potassium, 11 mg phosphorus 3. Blueberries Blueberries are classic additions to pancakes and blueberry muffins. Buy them frozen to use in smoothies or in a Blueberry Peach Crisp. When theyre in season, enjoy a bowl of fresh blueberries. 1/2 cup serving fresh blueberries 4 mg sodium, 65 mg potassium, 7 mg phosphorus 4. Blackberries/raspberries Sprinkle fresh berries on your cereal or oatmeal, use frozen ones in smoothies or bake them into pies such as More Mommas Blackberry Mountain Pie. Use berries in unexpected ways to bring out the flavor of meats, including this recipe for Raspberry Wings. 1/2 cup serving blackberries 1 mg sodium, 117 mg potassium, 16 mg phosphorus 1/2 cup serving raspberries 0 mg sodium, 93 mg potassium, 17 mg phosphorus 5. Garlic This tiny antioxidant powerhouse is available in fresh, bottled, minced or powdered form to use in Garlic Chicken with Balsamic Vinegar or another savory dish. Roasting a head of garlic mellows its flavor and makes a soft, delicious spread for bread. 1 clove garlic 1 mg sodium, 12 mg potassium, 4 mg phosphorus 6.",
    "Whats more, if chips are made from potatoes, theyll contain a significant amount of potassium as well (47Trusted Source). Summary Pretzels, chips, and crackers are easily consumed in large portions and tend to contain high amounts of salt. Additionally, chips made from potatoes provide a considerable amount of potassium. Kidney-friendly recipes Following a kidney-friendly diet requires limiting several foods, which can be challenging. However, there are many nutritious and delicious recipes that you can still enjoy as part of a balanced kidney diet. Here are a few tasty options available from the National Kidney Foundation: Chicken and Zucchini Quiche Pumpkin Pancakes Mexican-Style Stuffed Peppers Be sure to make adjustments as needed, depending on your specific needs and preferences. A renal dietitian can also recommend kidney-friendly recipes to help round out your diet. Summary There are many nutritious recipes available that can easily fit into a renal diet. You can also adjust recipes based on your needs and preferences. How are dietary restrictions for kidney disease determined? Your specific dietary restrictions will depend on your stage of kidney disease. For instance, people with early stages of chronic kidney disease will have different dietary restrictions than those with end-stage renal (kidney) disease or kidney failure. Those with end-stage kidney disease who require dialysis also have varying dietary restrictions. Dialysis is a type of treatment that removes extra water and filters waste (4Trusted Source). Most of those with late or end-stage kidney disease need to follow a kidney-friendly diet to avoid a buildup of certain chemicals or nutrients in the blood (5Trusted Source). In those with chronic kidney disease, the kidneys cannot adequately remove excess sodium, potassium, or phosphorus. As a result, theyre at a higher risk of elevated blood levels of these minerals (5Trusted Source). A kidney-friendly diet, or renal diet, usually limits sodium to under 2, 300 milligrams (mg) per day, as well as your potassium and phosphorus intake (5Trusted Source). The National Kidney Foundations most recent Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines dont set specific limits on potassium or phosphorus (6). Potassium and phosphorus are still a concern for people with kidney disease. Still, they should work closely with a doctor or dietitian to determine their personal limits for these nutrients, which are usually based on lab results. Damaged kidneys may also have trouble filtering the waste products of protein metabolism. Therefore, individuals with chronic kidney disease of all stages, especially stage 35, should limit the amount of protein in their diets unless theyre on dialysis (6, 7Trusted Source). However, those with end-stage kidney disease undergoing dialysis have an increased protein requirement (8Trusted Source). Frequently asked questions What foods help your kidneys work better? The best thing you can do to help your kidneys work better is to eat a well-balanced diet full of nutritious, vitamin-rich foods that are low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus (53).",
    "Frequently asked questions What foods help your kidneys work better? The best thing you can do to help your kidneys work better is to eat a well-balanced diet full of nutritious, vitamin-rich foods that are low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus (53). Some examples include: tofu cheese thats low in phosphorus (such as goat cheese, grated parmesan, mozzarella, Monterey Jack, Swiss cheese, and Brie) milk alternatives (such as oat, soy, or rice) healthy cooking oils (such as olive oil, safflower oil, or sesame oil) fish fresh fruit (like strawberries, blueberries, apples, pomegranates) beans Is peanut butter good for the kidneys? Peanut butter is a good source of plant-based protein. Its naturally low in carbohydrates, and has plenty of fiber to aid digestion. Its a good substitute for meat in a kidney diet plan. However, its worth noting that 2 tablespoons of peanut butter also has 65 milligrams of oxalate, and high amounts of oxalate can contribute to kidney stones (54, 55). Talk with your doctor if youre prone to kidney stones, as you may want avoid or reduce your peanut butter consumption. Also, when purchasing peanut butter, be sure to look for brands that dont add extra salt and sugar. Is chocolate bad for the kidneys? Dark chocolate is rich in antioxidants and has actually been shown to reduce certain markers of inflammation in people undergoing dialysis (50Trusted Source, 51Trusted Source). Still, chocolate is high in calories and added sugar and contains some phosphorus and potassium. Therefore, its best to enjoy it in moderation as part of a well-rounded diet, especially if you have kidney disease (52Trusted Source). Are eggs bad for the kidneys? Eggs are highly nutritious and can often fit into a balanced renal diet. However, people following a low protein diet may need to moderate their intake, depending on the amount of protein that they are allotted each day (48Trusted Source). Is coffee bad for the kidneys? Enjoying the occasional cup of coffee is typically fine on a renal diet and is unlikely to affect kidney health. However, drinking 34 cups (473710 mL) daily or adding large amounts of milk, creamer, or flavored syrup may increase potassium or phosphorus levels. Additionally, drinking multiple cups is not recommended if youve been advised to restrict your fluid intake (49). The bottom line If you have kidney disease, reducing your potassium, phosphorus, and sodium intake can be an important aspect of managing the disease. The high sodium, potassium, and phosphorus foods listed above are likely best limited or avoided. Dietary restrictions and nutrient intake recommendations will vary based on the severity of your kidney damage. Following a renal diet can seem daunting and a bit restrictive at times. However, working with a healthcare professional and renal dietitian can help you design a renal diet specific to your individual needs. What foods are bad for kidneys?

    "What foods are bad for kidneys? Renal diet Foods to avoid Other foods Summary People with kidney disease typically need to follow a diet low in sodium, protein, potassium, and phosphorus. This means limiting or avoiding foods such as avocados, brown rice, and chips. The kidneys perform many crucial functionsTrusted Source for health, including filtering waste products and excess fluid from the body and removing it through urine. They also regulate the bodys mineral balance and produce a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production. When a person has kidney disease, waste products can build up in their blood. A doctor may recommend dietary changes to help manage the condition and support kidney function. This article explains which foods to avoid or limit with kidney disease. It also provides an overview of the renal (or kidney-friendly) diet. Renal diet Bojan89/Getty Images A specialist kidney dietitian will typically work with people with kidney disease to tailor a diet to their needs. A kidney-friendly diet, also called a renal diet, may vary slightly depending on the stage of a persons kidney disease. For example, those in the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) should limit their sodium and possibly protein intake. In the later stagesTrusted Source of CKD, known as kidney failure, an individual should follow a diet that limits sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. Learn about the link between kidney disease and potassium. Foods to avoid A dietitian may ask that individuals following a renal diet avoid the following foods: 1. Canned foods Sodium, a main ingredient of salt, is a natural mineral often found in canned foods in high quantities. Manufacturers typically addTrusted Source sodium to canned items to increase shelf life and enhance taste. With CKD, the kidneys cannot eliminate excess sodium as they should. This means people with CKD should avoid or limit eating canned goods such as soup, vegetables, and beans. Choosing canned foods labeled low sodium and draining the contents can help reduce the amount of sodium a person consumes. 2. Whole wheat bread A buildup of phosphorus and potassium can causeTrusted Source problems for people with CKD. Due to the highTrusted Source content of these minerals in whole wheat bread, people with CKD should instead choose white bread. For example, one slice of whole wheat bread contains 76. 3 mgTrusted Source of phosphorus and 90 mg of potassium. White bread, on the other hand, contains 31. 6 mgTrusted Source of phosphorus and 32. 8 mg of potassium. If a person does not wish to stop eating whole wheat bread entirely, they could instead consider reducing the amount they eat. For example, they could eat just one slice with a meal rather than two. 3. Dark-colored drinks Many manufacturers of dark-colored drinks add phosphorus to their products to enhance flavor, prolong shelf life, and prevent discoloration. Phosphorus in its additive form, found in dark cola and beer, is highly absorbable by the human body and is not recommendedTrusted Source for those following a renal diet.",
    "Dark-colored drinks Many manufacturers of dark-colored drinks add phosphorus to their products to enhance flavor, prolong shelf life, and prevent discoloration. Phosphorus in its additive form, found in dark cola and beer, is highly absorbable by the human body and is not recommendedTrusted Source for those following a renal diet. However, root beer is an exception to this as it contains no phosphorusTrusted Source. 4. Avocados While healthcare professionals generally consider avocados a beneficial addition to a persons diet, people with renal problems may wish to avoid or limit them. This is because they are high in potassium, with one avocado weighing around 200 g containing 975 mgTrusted Source of potassium. According to the National Kidney Foundation, anything that exceeds 200 mg of potassium per serving is high in potassium. If needed, a person can still include avocados in their diet, but they should drastically reduce their portion size. 5. Bananas A large banana contains 487 mgTrusted Source of potassium, meaning a person with CKD should avoid or limit eating this fruit. Many other tropical fruits also have high potassium content. Pineapples may be a suitable alternative as they contain a much smaller amountTrusted Source of potassium compared with other tropical fruits. 6. Oranges and orange juice Oranges and orange juice are a potassium-rich food and drink. A small orange contains 174 mgTrusted Source of potassium, while 250 gTrusted Source of orange juice contains as much as 441 mg of potassium. Alternative fruits that are lower in potassium include grapes, apples, and cranberries. 7. Dried fruits Dried fruits are concentrated sources of many of the nutrients found in fresh fruits. This means it can be easier to exceed recommended daily intakes from them. People following a renal diet should avoid apricots, dates, prunes, and raisins, which are all high in potassium. 8. Tomatoes Tomatoes are another high potassium fruit that a person following a renal diet should limit. For reference, a cup (245 g) of tomato sauce contains 728 mgTrusted Source of potassium. 9. Brown rice While it is nutritious, brown rice has a higherTrusted Source phosphorus and potassium content than white rice. A cup (155 g) of cooked brown rice contains 149 mgTrusted Source of phosphorus and 94. 6 mg of potassium, while a cup (186 g) of cooked white rice contains 68. 8 mgTrusted Source of phosphorus and 53. 9 mg of potassium. Bulgur, buckwheat, and couscous are also alternatives to brown rice. 10. Dairy Despite dairy and milk traditionally being promoted for bone health, for people with CKD, consuming too much can be detrimental to bone health. The reason for this is that dairy is a natural source of phosphorus and potassium. A cup (244 g) of whole milk contains 205 mgTrusted Source of phosphorus and 322 mg of potassium. Kidney damage can cause an excess of phosphorus to build up in the blood (known as hyperphosphatemia). This condition can cause the body to pull calcium from the bones, resulting in thin, weak bones.",
    "Kidney damage can cause an excess of phosphorus to build up in the blood (known as hyperphosphatemia). This condition can cause the body to pull calcium from the bones, resulting in thin, weak bones. It is important for people following a renal diet to limit dairy products to avoid this buildup of protein waste in the blood. Coconut milk may be a favorable substitute for people with CKD based onTrusted Source its low potassium, sodium, and oxalate content. 11. Processed meats Processed meats are meats that manufacturers have salted, dried, cured, or canned. Some examples include hot dogs, bacon, and pepperoni. To improve their taste and preserve flavor, they often contain lots ofTrusted Source salt. If a person regularly eats highly processed foods, keeping their sodium intake to 2, 300 mg per day (the amount recommended by the National Kidney Foundation) may be difficult. 12. Pickles, olives, and relish Pickles, processed olives, and relish are all examples of cured or pickled foods. During the curing or pickling process, manufacturers typically add saltTrusted Source to the food. For reference, five green pickled olives (considered a small serving) equates to almost 10%Trusted Source of the daily recommended amount of sodium. 13. Bran cereals, oatmeal, and granola Many cereals contain a mixture of potassium, phosphorus, and sodium. A person following a renal diet should avoid all of these. For example, a 30 gTrusted Source serving of bran flakes contains 160 mg of potassium, 135 mg of phosphorus, and 162 mg of sodium. A 100 gTrusted Source serving of granola contains 539 mg of potassium. 14. Potatoes Potatoes, including sweet potatoes, are potassium-rich vegetables. A medium-sized baked potato contains around 610 mgTrusted Source of potassium, and a medium-sized sweet potato contains 542 mgTrusted Source of potassium. Leaching is one way a person can reduce the high potassium content in potatoes. This method essentially involves soaking or boiling potatoes in water before cooking, which, according to older research, reduces the original potassium content by at least 50%Trusted Source. 15. Processed foods Processed foods include pizza, instant noodles, and convenience meals designed for the microwave. These foods typically contain high levels of salt, sugar, and fat. As mentioned above, the National Kidney Foundation recommends keeping sodium intake to 2, 300 mg per day. This may prove difficult if a person is eating highly processed foods regularly. 16. Pretzels, chips, and crackers Foods such as pretzels, chips, and crackers are typically high in sodium and lacking in nutrients. Because chips come from potatoes, they are also high in potassium. A small bag of potato chips contains around 148 mgTrusted Source of sodium and 336 mg of potassium, and 60 g of pretzels contain roughly 744 mgTrusted Source of sodium and 134 mg of potassium. The portion sizes of these snacks can often lead to greater salt intake than intended. 17.",
    "The portion sizes of these snacks can often lead to greater salt intake than intended. 17. Swiss chard, spinach, and beet greens There are many green, leafy vegetables that people following a renal diet may need to avoid or limit due to their high potassium content. This is the case for Swiss chard, spinach, and beet greens. For example, a cup of raw Swiss chard contains 136 mgTrusted Source of potassium. As with spinach, this vegetable shrinks when boiled, meaning a person may eat more than they would raw. A person with CKD should consider this as it will, in turn, increase their intake of potassium. Kidney-friendly foods Although an individual with CKD must adapt their diet, there are still many suitable options for them to try. People should choose foods with lower levels of sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. These include: Fruit: Options include apples, cranberries, grapes, pineapple, and strawberries. Vegetables: Options include cauliflower, lettuce, onions, peppers, and radishes. Baked goods: Options include pita, tortillas, and sourdough bread. Protein: Options include beef and chicken. Carbohydrates: Options include white rice and unsalted popcorn. Learn about other foods that are good for the kidneys. Summary If an individual has CKD, doctors typically recommend reducing their intake of potassium, phosphorus, and sodium to help manage the condition. The dietary restrictions depend on the stage of the disease. Although there is a long list of foods that are best to avoid on a renal diet, there is also a wide range of foods that people can eat without affecting their kidney health. An individual may work with a renal dietitian to find the most suitable diet for them. When you have kidney problems, diet becomes more important than ever. Our kidneys remove toxins from our bodies. When you have chronic kidney disease (CKD), your bodys ability to remove waste is compromised. Making conscious food choices and having a well-balanced diet becomes an important part in managing your disease progression. Ms Lynette Goh, Principal Dietitian, and Ms Ng Su Yi, Senior Dietitian at the National University Polyclinics (NUP) has answers to some of the common questions from patients with CKD. Why is diet important in managing my CKD? The kidneys work to maintain a good balance of fluids, salts and minerals in the blood. When kidneys no longer work as they used to, there is a need to change ones diet to prevent excess waste and fluids from building up in the body. A kidney-friendly diet can also help preserve kidney function or delay progression to kidney failure. What is an appropriate diet differs from person to person, and very much depends on their level of kidney function. What nutrients should I be concerned about if I have CKD? Protein, sodium and potassium are the main nutrients to watch closely. The required intake of these nutrients will differ according to the patients age, body size, physical activity levels and stage of kidney disease.",
    "What nutrients should I be concerned about if I have CKD? Protein, sodium and potassium are the main nutrients to watch closely. The required intake of these nutrients will differ according to the patients age, body size, physical activity levels and stage of kidney disease. Since theres so much variation, the best thing to do would be to consult your dietitian for a personalised diet plan. Sodium A patient with CKD should cut down on sodium, which is commonly found in salt as well as processed and canned foods. Sodium is known to cause retention of fluids in the body. Fluid retention in the body increases blood pressure and worsens CKD. However, it should be noted that the body does need some sodium and so it cannot be cut out entirely. Potassium Potassium is generally a good mineral for most people because it helps maintain a regular heartbeat and proper functioning of the nerves and muscles in the body. However, when the kidneys are not working as well, potassium may build up to dangerous levels in the body and this can affect the proper functioning of the heart. Potassium is found in fruits and vegetables, but dont be afraid to include them in your diet. Tips on avoiding those with higher sources and preparing them in the right way can help you maintain a safe potassium level, shared Ms Goh. Try these tips to maintain a healthy potassium level: 1. Replace fruits and vegetables with high potassium content with those of low or moderate potassium content High potassium content Moderate to low potassium content Fruits Banana, melons, dates, kiwi, plums, dried fruits. Apple, pear, orange, guava, lychee, mango, rambutan, papaya, watermelon, grapes Vegetables Bitter gourd, cabbage, Chinese kale (kai lan), mustard greens (chye sim), spinach, potato, tapioca. Bean sprouts (tau geh) cabbage, French beans, hairy cucumber, lady fingers/ okra, lettuce. 2. Keep to 2 servings of fruits and 2 servings of vegetables per day Example of 1 serving of fruit Example of 1 serving of vegetables 1 small apple/orange/pear (130g), 1 slices of papaya/watermelon (130g), 10 grapes (50g) ¾ cup of cooked vegetables (100g), 100g raw non-leafy vegetables, 150g raw leafy vegetables 3. Eat whole fruits and vegetables instead of having fruit or vegetable juices, or dried fruit 4. Cut fresh vegetables into small pieces, and soak them in water for 1-2 hours prior to cooking to remove the potassium. Discard the water and rinse the vegetables before cooking. 5. Drain all juice or syrups from canned fruits and vegetables. Protein When we eat food that contains protein, the body breaks down the protein in order to absorb and use it. However, this process produces waste products, which require the kidneys to work. One misconception that CKD patients have is to cut out protein entirely, however the downside of such over-restriction is that your body does not get enough nutrients to function properly.",

One misconception that CKD patients have is to cut out protein entirely, however the downside of such over-restriction is that your body does not get enough nutrients to function properly. Protein is needed for building and maintaining muscles, healing wounds, and supporting your immune system, explained Ms Ng. She added that there is no standard diet or amount prescribed to patients. Each individuals dietary needs are different and changes depending on their kidney function. Food tastes bland now that I have to limit my sodium intake. How do I add flavour to my cooking? Food will likely taste bland at first as your taste buds are not used to it. Give yourself six weeks to adjust to a lower sodium diet. You can also have fun with herbs and spices to give your food an extra boost of flavour, shared Ms Goh. When adapting to a new diet, its easier to make changes gradually. You can start by reducing salt and processed sauces by half and using more natural seasonings such as lime, lemon juice, fresh chillies, onions, garlic and ginger. Herbs such as parsley, coriander, basil, and mint and spices such as pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, cumin and curry powder may also be used to flavour food. Just remember to choose fresh foods instead of canned or processed ones which usually contain high levels of sodium. Also, always taste your food before adding more salt or sauces, and avoid adding extra salt and sauces when youre eating. I dont have time to cook but its so difficult to eat out with my diet restrictions! Any advice or tips for eating out? Eating out can be challenging as most meals are high in salt intake. Here are four simple ways to cut down on salt when eating out: When having dishes with soup, such as noodles, ask to have the dish dry (i. e. leave the soup out) as the soup often contains high levels of salt. Request your dish to be cooked with less sauce and gravy wherever possible. If you prefer spicy food, ask for fresh-cut chilli instead of sambal or other spicy sauces. Choose meals prepared with fresh vegetables and lean meat, poultry or fish instead of processed foods such as canned or processed meat (e. g. fishballs, fishcake, and sausages). Im vegetarian. How do I ensure Im getting enough protein? It is important to plan your meals instead of eating what turns up to ensure youre getting enough and the right nutrients, including protein. A good guiding principle is to consciously include plant-based protein in every meal, said Ms Ng.",
    "Im vegetarian. How do I ensure Im getting enough protein? It is important to plan your meals instead of eating what turns up to ensure youre getting enough and the right nutrients, including protein. A good guiding principle is to consciously include plant-based protein in every meal, said Ms Ng. Good sources of plant-based protein include: Soya and soya products such as tofu, tempeh, and soya milk Meat alternatives such as non-fried soy meat and plant-based burger patties that may include soy protein, beans, and/or lentils Dried beans, peas, and lentils Grains (e. g. quinoa, brown rice and oatmeal) Nuts, nut butter (e. g. hazelnut and almond butter) and seeds (e. g. sesame and sunflower seeds) If you are lacto-ovo-vegetarian, you may also wish to consider dairy products such as low-fat milk, low-fat yoghurt, cheese, and eggs in your diet as these too are good sources of protein. Changing your diet may not be as hard as you think! Whether or not you suffer from CKD, a good diet maintains a healthy body and well-functioning kidneys. In consultation with Ms Lynette Goh, Principal Dietitian and Ms Ng Su Yi, Senior Dietitian, NUP Lifestyle Dietetics National University Polyclinics Can Kidney Patients eat fruit and vegetables Can kidney patients eat fruit and vegetables? Tips on making low potassium choices when eating fruit and vegetables. Contrary to popular belief, patients with kidney disease CAN include fruit and vegetables, even with the dreaded potassium restrictions. Fruit and vegetables are an important part of a healthy, balanced diet and provide many vitamins and minerals, fibre and taste. When your kidney function starts to decline, the potassium levels in your blood may start to increase and you may be advised to follow a low potassium diet in order to help reduce it to a safe level. Not all renal patients need to follow a low potassium diet and it is important not to restrict yourself unless you have been advised by a qualified health professional. Your renal dietician can advise you how to follow a low potassium diet while making sure your diet stays balanced, nutritious and tasty. Fruit and vegetables are a known high source of potassium, however the types chosen and how they are prepared and cooked can impact on their potassium content. Even with a potassium restriction, two portions of fruit, such as an apple and an orange and two portions of vegetables, such as two heaped tablespoons each of carrots and broccoli, are allowed daily. Avoiding known higher sources and preparing them in the right way, helps you to maintain a safe potassium level within your blood. Tips on making low potassium choices when eating fruit and vegetables: Boil potatoes and vegetables in a large amount of water. Three egg sized potatoes are a suitable portion if following a low potassium diet. Make sure they are well cooked, double boiling is NOT necessary."
