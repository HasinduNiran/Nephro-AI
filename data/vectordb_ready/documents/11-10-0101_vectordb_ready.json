In each stage, the kidneys dont work as well as the stage before. The stages are determined by the level of kidney function. Kidney function is measured by a test called glomerular filtration rate, or glomerular filtration rate. This number tells how well the glomeruli are filtering waste and extra fluid. A person can lose a lot of kidney function before feeling symptoms of kidney disease. When kidneys fail, a person needs a kidney transplant or dialysis to stay alive. A kidney transplant replaces a failed kidney with a healthy kidney from someone else. Dialysis uses a machine or other equipment to filter the blood. THE GOOD NEWS: If chronic kidney disease is found in the early stages, it can be treated. Stage 1 is the earliest. Early treatment may keep it from getting worse. People with kidney damage for 3 months or more usually have chronic kidney disease. AND People with a glomerular filtration rate less than 60 for 3 months or more usually have chronic kidney disease. 8 9 COPYRIGHT: NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DO NOT REPRODUCE.

What Can Damage Diabetes the Kidneys? Diabetes is the most common cause of kidney disease. Diabetes is a chronic disease where the body cannot control sugar. A high sugar level in the blood damages the small filters (glomeruli) in the kidneys. In people with diabetes, kidneys do not filter as well. They are more likely to filter out tiny amounts of albumin into the urine instead of keeping it in the blood. Albumin is a type of protein needed by the body. Having protein in the urine is a sign of kidney damage. When diabetes is controlled, there is less chance of damage to the kidneys.
