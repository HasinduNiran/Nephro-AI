    "STAGE 5 Kidney Transplant What you need to know Stages of chronic kidney disease There are 5 stages of kidney disease as shown in the table below. Your healthcare provider will tell you the stage of kidney disease, based on how well your kidneys are working and your estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate). The estimated glomerular filtration rate number comes from a lab test that measures the amount of blood your kidneys are filtering each minute. As chronic kidney disease gets worse, the estimated glomerular filtration rate number goes down. STAGES OF KIDNEY DISEASE ESTIMATED GLOMERULAR FILTRATION KIDNEY STAGE DESCRIPTION RATE (estimated glomerular filtration rate) FUNCTION Kidney damage (e. g. , protein 1 in the urine) with normal 90 or above 90100% kidney function Kidney damage with mild 2 60 to 89 loss of kidney function 6089% Mild to moderate loss of 3a 45 to 59 kidney function 4559% Moderate to severe loss of 3b 30 to 44 kidney function 3044% Severe loss of kidney 4 15 to 29 function 1529% 5 Kidney failure Less than 15 Less than 15% 2 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Contents About Kidney Transplantation. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 Getting a Transplant. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 After Your Transplant. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 About Organ Donation. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 Finding a Living Donor. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 Five Ways to Inspire Living Kidney Donation. . . . . . . . 25 Where can I find more information? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27 KIDNEY. ORG 3 About Kidney Transplantation When your kidneys fail, treatment is needed to replace the work your own kidneys can no longer do. There are two types of treatment for kidney failure dialysis and kidney transplantation. This brochure can help you decide if a kidney transplant is the best choice for you. What is a kidney transplant? When you get a kidney transplant, a healthy kidney is placed inside your body to do the work your own kidneys can no longer do. Many people feel that a kidney transplant offers more freedom and a better quality of life than dialysis. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION On the plus side, there are fewer limits on what you can eat and drink, but you should follow a hearthealthy diet. Your health and energy should improve. In fact, a successful kidney transplant may allow you to live the kind of life you were living before you got kidney disease. Studies show that people with kidney transplants live longer than those who remain on dialysis. On the minus side, there are the risks of surgery. You will also need to take anti-rejection medicines for as long as your new kidney is working, which can have side effects. You will have a higher risk for infections and certain types of cancer.",
    "You will have a higher risk for infections and certain types of cancer. Although most transplants are successful and last for many years, how long they last can vary from one person to the next. Many people will need more than one kidney transplant during their lifetime. What is a preemptive or early transplant? Getting a transplant before you need to start dialysis is called a preemptive transplant. It allows you to avoid dialysis altogether. Getting a transplant not long after kidneys fail (but with some time on dialysis) is referred to as an early transplant. Both have benefits. Some research shows that a preemptive or early transplant, with little or no time spent on dialysis, can lead to better long-term health. It may also allow you to keep working, save time and money, and have a better quality of life. KIDNEY. ORG 5 Who can get a kidney transplant? Kidney patients of all agesfrom children to seniors can get a transplant. You must be healthy enough to have the operation. You must also be free from cancer and infection. Every person being considered for transplant will get a full medical and psychosocial evaluation to make sure they are a good candidate for transplant. The evaluation helps find any problems, so they can be corrected before transplant. For most people, getting a transplant can be a good treatment choice. What if Im older or have other health problems? In many cases, people who are older or have other health conditions like diabetes can still have successful kidney transplants. Careful evaluation is needed to understand and deal with any special risks. You may be asked to do some things that can lessen certain risks and improve the chances of a successful transplant. For example, you may be asked to lose weight or quit smoking. If you have diabetes, you may also be able to have a pancreas transplant. Ask your healthcare professional about getting a pancreas transplant along with a kidney transplant. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How will I pay for a transplant? Medicare covers about 80% of the costs associated with an evaluation, transplant operation, follow-up care, and anti-rejection medicines. Private insurers and state programs may cover some costs as well. However, your post-transplant expenses may only be covered for a limited number of years. Its important to discuss coverage with your social worker, who can answer your questions or direct you to others who can help. KIDNEY. ORG 7 Getting a Transplant How do I start the process of getting a kidney transplant? Ask your healthcare provider to refer you to a transplant center for an evaluation. Any kidney patient can ask for an evaluation. How does the evaluation process work? Medical professionals will give you a complete physical exam, review your health records, and order a series of tests and X-rays to learn about your overall health. Everything that can affect how well you can handle treatment will be checked. The evaluation process for a transplant is very thorough. Your healthcare team will need to know a lot about you to help themand youdecide if a transplant is right for you. One thing you can do to speed up the process is to get all the testing done as quickly as possible and stay in close contact with the transplant team. If youre 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION told you might not be right for a transplant, dont be afraid to ask whyor if you might be eligible at some future time or at another center.",
    "Remember, being active in your own care is one of the best ways to stay healthy. If someone you know would like to donate a kidney to you, that person will also need to go through a screening to find out if he or she is a match and healthy enough to donate. If its your child who has kidney disease, youll want to give serious thought to getting a transplant evaluation for him or her. Because transplantation allows children and young adults to develop in as normal a way as possible in their formative years, it can be the best treatment for them. If the evaluation process shows that a transplant is right for you or your child, the next step is getting a suitable kidney. (See About Organ Donation on. ) KIDNEY. ORG 9 What does the operation involve? You may be surprised to learn that your own kidneys generally arent taken out when you get a transplant. The surgeon leaves them where they are unless there is a medical reason to remove them. The donated kidney is placed into your lower abdomen (belly), where its easiest to connect it to your important blood vessels and bladder. Putting the new kidney in your abdomen also makes it easier to take care of any problems that might come up. The operation takes about four hours. Youll be sore at first, but you should be out of bed in a day or so, and home within a week. If the kidney came from a living donor, it should start to work very quickly. A 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION kidney from a deceased donor can take longer to start workingtwo to four weeks or more. If that happens, you may need dialysis until the kidney begins to work. After surgery, youll be taught about the medicines youll have to take and their side effects. Youll also learn about diet. If youve been on dialysis, youll find that there are fewer restrictions on what you can eat and drink, which is one of the benefits of a transplant. What are anti-rejection medicines? Normally, your body fights off anything that International Society of Nephrologyt part of itself, like germs and viruses. This system of protection is called your immune system. To stop your body from attacking or rejecting the donated kidney, you will have to take medicines to keep your immune system less active (called anti-rejection medicines or immunosuppressive medicines). Youll need to take them as long as your new kidney is working. Without them, your immune system would see the donated kidney as foreign, and would attack and destroy it. Anti-rejection medicines can have some side effects. It is important to talk to your healthcare provider about them, so that you know what to expect. Fortunately, for most people, side effects are usually manageable. Changing the dose or type of medicine can often ease some of the side effects. KIDNEY. ORG 11 Besides the immunosuppressive medicines, you will take other medicines as well. You will take medicines to protect you from infection, too. Most people find taking medicines a small trade for the freedom and quality of life that a successful transplant can provide. Important Reminder You must not take any medicine or nutritional supplement that is not approved by your transplant team because of the risk of interaction with your anti-rejection medicines. 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION After Your Transplant What happens after I go home? Once you are home from the hospital, the most important work beginsthe follow-up.",
    "Once you are home from the hospital, the most important work beginsthe follow-up. For your transplant to be successful, you will have regular checkups, especially during the first year. At first, you may need blood tests several times a week. After that, youll need fewer checkups, but enough to make sure that your kidney is working well and that you have the right amount of anti-rejection medication in your body. What if my body tries to reject the new kidney? One thing that you and your healthcare team will watch for is acute rejection, which means that your body is suddenly trying to reject the transplanted kidney. A rejection episode may not have any clear signs or symptoms. That is why it is so important to have regular blood tests to check how well your kidney is working. Things you might notice that can let you know you are having rejection are fevers, decreased urine output, swelling, weight gain, and pain over your kidney. KIDNEY. ORG 13 The chances of having a rejection episode are highest right after your surgery. The longer you have the kidney, the lower the chance that this will happen. Unfortunately, sometimes a rejection episode happens even if youre doing everything youre supposed to do. Sometimes the body just doesnt accept the transplanted kidney. But even if a rejection episode happens, there are many ways to treat it so you do not lose your new kidney. Letting your transplant team know right away that you think you have symptoms of rejection is very important. How often do rejection episodes happen? Rejections happen much less often nowadays. Thats because there have been many improvements in immunosuppressive medicines. However, the risk of rejection is different for every person. For most people, rejection can be stopped with special antirejection medicines. Its very important to have regular checkups to see how well your kidney is working, and make sure you are not having rejection. When can I return to work? How soon you can return to work depends on your recovery, the kind of work you do, and your other medical conditions. Many people can return to work eight weeks or more after their transplant. Your transplant team will help you decide when you can go back to work. 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Will my sex life be affected? People who have not had satisfactory sexual relations due to kidney disease may notice an improvement as they begin to feel better. In addition, fertility (the ability to conceive children) tends to increase. Men who have had a kidney transplant have fathered healthy children, and women with kidney transplants have had successful pregnancies. Its best to talk to your healthcare practitioner when considering having a child. Women should avoid becoming pregnant too soon after a transplant. Most centers want women to wait a year or more. All pregnancies must be planned. Certain medications that can harm a developing baby must be stopped six weeks before trying to get pregnant. Birth control counseling may be helpful. Its important to protect yourself against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Be sure to use protection during sexual activity. Will I need to follow a special diet? In general, transplant recipients should eat a hearthealthy diet (low fat, low salt) and drink plenty of fluids. If you have diabetes or other health problems, you may still have some dietary restrictions. A dietitian can help you plan meals that are right for you. KIDNEY. ORG 15 About Organ Donation Where do donated kidneys come from?",
    "By starting a dialogue and educating those around you, you may find that many people will ask how they can help. Ask your family and friends to spread the word. Its important to keep your options open as you never know when a potential donor is going to walk through the door! 24 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION How do I write a letter or email to my friends and family? One way to spread the word is to share your story by letter or email. Here are some tips for writing to your friends, family, or community: Make it personal; tell your story (what is treatment like, how do you feel). Use information on kidney. org to include facts on kidney disease, living donation, and transplant. Invite people to learn more and provide contact details. Ask your transplant center if they want their contact number posted in your letters. They may have a special line, or prefer that people call you first. KIDNEY. ORG 25 SAMPLE LETTER Dear Friends, Some of you may know that I have kidney disease. Over time, my kidney disease has gotten worse, causing my kidneys not to work well enough to keep me alive. This is what I am facing now, and my treatment options are limited to dialysis treatments or a kidney transplant. Getting regular dialysis treatments, usually three times a week for four hours at a time, will help my kidneys do their job and keep me alive, but a transplant would offer me more freedom and the ability to live a longer, healthier, more normal life. A transplant would also give me more time to do the fun things I enjoy most, like spending time with my family and friends. However, finding a kidney for a transplant is not easy. Just ask the 130, 000 people on the waiting list for a deceased donor kidney like me. Time is not on our side. Some wait for years; many die while waiting. The 26 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION average wait time is five years or more for a kidney from a deceased donor. However, there is another option: receiving a kidney from a living donor. Asking a family member or a friend to consider donating a kidney to me is difficult, but it greatly improves my chances of getting a transplant. A living kidney donation typically lasts longer and has better function. You might not know a lot about living donationI know I didnt before kidney disease affected my life. Understandably, some people are afraid about the surgery and what living with one kidney will mean for them. Heres some basic information about kidney donation: You only need one kidney to live a healthy, long life. Most donor surgery is done laparoscopically, meaning through tiny incisions. The recuperation period is usually fairly quick (generally two weeks). KIDNEY. ORG 27 The cost of your evaluation and surgery will be covered by my insurance. The hospital can give you extensive information on this. You will have a separate team of healthcare professionals to evaluate you as a living donor. Their job is to help you understand the risks and benefits and look out for YOUR best interests. You can also learn more about living donation on the National Kidney Foundation (National Kidney Foundation) website: kidney. org/livingdonation or by contacting the National Kidney Foundations free, confidential helpline at 844. 2BIGASK (844. 224. 4275) or bigaskkidney. org.
