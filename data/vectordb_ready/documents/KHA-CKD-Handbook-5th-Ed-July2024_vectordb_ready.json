Or Evidence of kidney damage, with or without decreased glomerular filtration rate that is present for ≥3 months, as evidenced by the following: Albuminuria Structural abnormalities Haematuria after exclusion (e. g. , on kidney imaging tests) of urological causes Pathological abnormalities (e. g. , kidney biopsy) chronic kidney disease is generally asymptomatic Up to 90% of kidney function may be lost before symptoms are present, so 1-2 yearly checks for individuals at increased risk are essential. Signs and symptoms of advancing chronic kidney disease may be general in nature and include: Hypertension Malaise Pruritis Anorexia Nocturia Restless legs Lethargy Haematuria Nausea/vomiting Dyspnoea 11 Targeted detection of chronic kidney disease Three out of four Australians aged 18 years and over are at increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease. Detection of chronic kidney disease should be targeted and focus on people who are known to be at increased risk of developing the condition. The following people are at increased risk of chronic kidney disease: Diabetes Hypertension Established Family histo ry cardiovascular of kidney failure disease Obesity (body mass Current or past History of acute index ≥30kg/m2 smoker/vaper kidney injury 18 All people aged First Nations Australians 60 years or older aged 18 years or older First Nations Australians experience a higher burden, earlier onset, and faster progression of kidney disease, due to ongoing impacts of colonisation. Clinical tip Individuals at increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease should be offered a Kidney Health Check (blood pressure, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, estimated glomerular filtration rate) every 1-2 years (annually for First Nations Australians aged ≥18 years, and anyone with diabetes or hypertension). See for information on testing people at risk of chronic kidney disease. 12 Kidney Health Australia Detecting and diagnosing chronic kidney disease Early detection of chronic kidney disease Benefits of early detection Allows for early intervention with treatment approaches and medications that can slow the progression of kidney disease and reduce cardiovascular risk. Facilitates appropriate adjustments to drug dosing, prescribing of medications to slow chronic kidney disease progression, establishment of a sick day action plan, and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications. Gives patients time to make positive lifestyle changes and appropriately consider treatment options before reaching kidney failure. Has economic benefits for the health system, with every 1 invested leading to 45 of savings in the cost of treating kidney failure and associated cardiovascular disease. 24 The Kidney Health Check Targeted detection of chronic kidney disease occurs via Kidney Health Checks for patients at increased risk. The Kidney Health Check involves the following: Blood pressure check Urine test Blood test Consider ambulatory Albumin/creatinine estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated from blood pressure (ABP) ratio (albumin-creatinine ratio) to check serum creatinine. monitoring or home blood pressure for albuminuria. monitoring in addition to in-clinic readings.

Established cardiovascular disease is defined as a previous diagnosis of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease. There is emerging evidence that the long-term effects of COVID-19 may also increase the risk of future kidney disease. 25 Therefore, a Kidney Health Check is recommended for individuals who have experienced acute kidney injury (acute kidney injury) as a complication of COVID-19 infection and for those with long COVID. A Kidney Health Check is recommended for people who have had hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia and pregnancy-induced hypertension, which are associated with increased future risk of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. 14 Kidney Health Australia Detecting and diagnosing chronic kidney disease Early detection of chronic kidney disease in First Nations Australians26 Indications for Recommended Assessment assessment frequency Aged 18 years As needed Screen for red flags of chronic kidney disease: Family history of chronic kidney disease Clinical history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, smoking, established cardiovascular disease, or acute kidney injury Clinical history of low birth weight Clinical history of recurrent childhood infections Also consider: Socioeconomic status, regional/rural and remote location, housing status, education level Complete a Kidney Health Check (estimated glomerular filtration rate, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and blood pressure check) if concerned.

Attempts should be made to identify the underlying cause of chronic kidney disease and to fully specify it, e. g. , chronic kidney disease stage 3b with microalbuminuria (or A2) in the presence of type 2 diabetes. Remember to code all chronic kidney disease diagnoses in your practice software. Staging of chronic kidney disease Once an individual is diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, it is useful to determine their chronic kidney disease stage and corresponding chronic kidney disease action plan as this will guide management strategies. To correctly stage chronic kidney disease, combine the persons kidney function stage (stage 1-5 determined by their estimated glomerular filtration rate) with their albuminuria stage. This is then plotted on the colour-coded chronic kidney disease staging table to determine which action plan they should follow.

Working with the individual to implement positive lifestyle changes in relation to: Smoking, Nutrition, Alcohol, Physical activity (SNAP)33, as well as adequate sleep, and stress management, can have a positive effect on chronic kidney disease outcomes and delay the progression of disease. The 5 As provide a key framework for addressing lifestyle changes. advise/ ask assess assist arrange agree Smoking / vaping Target Dont smoke or vape. To aid smoking/vaping cessation, recommend counselling and if required, nicotine replacement therapy or other medication. Compared to people who have never smoked, the risk of developing chronic kidney disease is increased by 27% for ever smokers, 34% for current smokers and 15% for former smokers. 34 Vaping has been associated with an increased occurrence of albuminuria and raised urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio levels.",

Healthy dietary patterns are associated with reduced risk of mortality and kidney failure, 37 developing chronic kidney disease, 38 and progression of CKD39. Consuming adequate fruits (2 serves /day) and vegetables (5 serves / day) can reduce the rate of kidney function decline, decrease body weight and blood pressure, and net acid production to manage metabolic acidosis in chronic kidney disease. 40 Fluid Make water your drink of choice. There is no recommendation for the number of glasses of water that should be consumed daily for kidney health. It is recommended that people should drink water to satisfy thirst. Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) have shown to elevate the risk and progression of chronic kidney disease and should be avoided. Salt Salt intake should be reduced to 5 g per day. This may be achieved by adopting strategies, such as: not adding salt in cooking or at the table. choosing packaged foods with 120 magnesium sodium per 100 g. People with a history of hyperkalaemia should not use salt substitutes and use caution with some reduced salt products, due to them containing high amounts of potassium chloride. Ultra- All people with chronic kidney disease should avoid ultra-processed foods high processed in fat, sugar, and salt, such as biscuits, cakes, packaged snack foods and foods, takeaway foods, soft drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks, sugar fruit juices and cordials. Individualised diets, tailored to cultural differences, food intolerances, cooking skills, food security, comorbidities (such as diabetes), and cost should be considered when recommending dietary options to patients with chronic kidney disease and their families. For adults with diabetes and chronic kidney disease, there is no one specific eating pattern that is superior. Individualised advice is recommended to help optimise glycaemic control. 41 Consider referral to an Accredited Practising Dietitian (APD), especially for help with implementing complex dietary changes, such as potassium restrictions, and if other chronic conditions such as diabetes, are present. 30 Kidney Health Australia Managing chronic kidney disease in Primary Care Further information and resources Kidney Health Australia Diet and Nutrition resources.

    "Include muscle strengthening activities as part of daily activity at least twice per week. 17 31 Higher cardiorespiratory fitness levels, increased participation in physical activity and less time spent in sedentary pursuits are all associated with better outcomes in those living with chronic kidney disease. 42 A persons overall health, heart health, comorbidities and physical capacity should be considered before increasing physical activity. Light to moderate intensity exercise is a safe starting point for most individuals. Vigorous intensity exercise should only be undertaken by those already doing this level of activity. 43, 44 Further information and resources Physical activity and exercise guidelines for all Australians. Weight management Target Waist circumference 94 cm in men (90 cm in Asian men) or 80 cm in women (including Asian women). body mass index 25 kg/m2 (23 kg/m2 Asian population16). Central obesity (measured by waist circumference) is a strong predictor of chronic kidney disease progression. Obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2) doubles the risk of developing chronic kidney disease. 45 People with body mass index ≥30 kg/m2 may be more likely to develop albuminuria. 45 Further information and resources Resources on Obesity and Overweight. 32 Kidney Health Australia Managing chronic kidney disease in Primary Care Pharmacological management of chronic kidney disease Clinical tip Remember to code chronic kidney disease correctly.

In a primary care setting, it is very likely that individuals will have a chronic kidney disease diagnosis that sits alongside one or more other chronic conditions. chronic kidney disease shares many treatment goals and management strategies with other common chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

The risks of uncontrolled hypertension include, progression of kidney disease and increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Hypertension should be considered as part of cardiovascular risk (see ). Hypertension treatment targets Who? Target All people with chronic kidney disease Maintain blood pressure consistently below 130/80 mmHg Some evidence and clinical guidelines suggest aiming for a lower blood pressure target (systolic blood pressure 120mmHg) in people with chronic kidney disease who are at high cardiovascular disease risk may improve outcomes. 72-75 Aiming for a systolic blood pressure of 120 mmHg may be appropriate in certain individuals who are at very high cardiovascular risk. Lower blood pressure targets need to be balanced with an increased risk of side effects including: increased risk of falls due to hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities and episodes of acute kidney injury. 52 Kidney Health Australia Managing chronic kidney disease alongside other chronic conditions Algorithm for management of hypertension in people with chronic kidney disease Person has chronic kidney disease Is blood pressure consistently below target (130/80 mmHg)?

System (renal artery stenosis) Based on many clinical trials demonstrating their inhibitors - e. g. , effectiveness in decreasing proteinuria and delaying chronic kidney disease ACE inhibitors or progression, the use of renal artery stenosis inhibitors is recommended as ARBs the first-line pharmacologic strategy for patients with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria with and without diabetes. They cause a reduction in glomerular blood flow, and glomerular filtration rate can decline when treatment is initiated. Provided the reduction is less than 25% within two weeks of starting therapy, the ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker should be continued. If the reduction in glomerular filtration rate is greater than 25% below the baseline value, the ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker should be ceased, and a referral to a nephrologist considered. In general, combined therapy with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker is not recommended. Caution should be exercised if baseline potassium is ≥5. 5 millimoles per liter, as rises in serum potassium of approximately 0. 5 millimoles per liter are expected (see ). ACE inhibitors or ARBs can be safely prescribed at all stages of chronic kidney disease and should not be ceased as glomerular filtration rate progressively declines but continued if tolerated. 76 Calcium May be used for people with angina, the elderly and those channel with systolic hypertension.",

When more than 80 magnesium/d is required, the efficacy is improved by dividing the daily dose. Thiazides can be effective at low levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate, particularly in combination with loop diuretics. For more information on managing oedema, see. 55 Medication Notes on use in people with chronic kidney disease Beta-blockers Beta-blockers are useful agents for blood pressure control in people with chronic kidney disease. For use of beta-blockers in heart failure, refer to the National Heart Foundation Australia guidelines. 77 Steroidal MRA Steroidal MRAs may be used for people with concomitant heart failure or hypertension. Use with caution in chronic kidney disease and in combination with renal artery stenosis blockade, due to risk of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate and hyperkalaemia. Non-steroidal MRAs can be safely used in the setting of type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Steroidal and nonsteroidal MRAs should not be prescribed together. For both agents, it is recommended to monitor potassium carefully. Clinical tip ACE inhibitors, ARBs, SGLT2 inhibitors and diuretics should be temporarily discontinued during acute illness, especially in the context of sepsis, hypovolaemia, or hypotension, and recommenced when the condition stabilises. Clinical tip ACE inhibitors and ARBs cause a reversible reduction in glomerular blood flow and glomerular filtration rate can decline when treatment is initiated. Check estimated glomerular filtration rate within 2 weeks following initiation. Provided the reduction is less than 25% within two weeks of starting therapy, the ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker should be continued. If the reduction in glomerular filtration rate is greater than 25% below the baseline value, the ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker should be ceased, and referral to a nephrologist considered.

It is caused by the accumulation of the breakdown products of protein metabolism. The symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and in the advanced stages confusion (encephalopathy), muscle twitching, pericarditis, fluid overload, convulsions, and coma. Although urea and creatinine are the substances measured, the symptoms are most likely due to the accumulation of other unmeasured toxic end products. By the time uraemia becomes symptomatic, dialysis is typically indicated. Management Dialysis should be commenced based on assessment of uraemic symptoms, not estimated glomerular filtration rate or biochemistry. If non-dialysis pathway is planned, the patient should be reviewed by a specialist kidney supportive care team for assessment of symptoms and nondialysis therapies. These may include dietary modifications, fluid restriction, anti-emetics, and therapy to address pruritus. 71 5 Progressive chronic kidney disease 72 Kidney Health Australia Indications for referral to a nephrologist32, 110 Appropriate referral is associated with positive outcomes, including: Reduced rate of progression to kidney failure. Decreased morbidity and mortality. Decreased need for and duration of hospitalisation. Increased likelihood of timely preparation of permanent dialysis access prior to dialysis onset. Increased likelihood of kidney transplantation.
