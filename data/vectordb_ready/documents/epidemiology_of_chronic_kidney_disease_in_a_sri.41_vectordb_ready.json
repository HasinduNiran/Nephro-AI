Sheriff2 University Medical Unit1, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Department of Clinical Medicine2, Faculty of Medicine, Colombo, Sri Lanka ABSTRACT. Chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) is a growing problem in Sri Lanka. Diabetes and hypertension are the main contributors to the disease burden. A new form of chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology (chronic kidney disease-u) is the predominant form of chronic kidney disease in certain parts of Sri Lanka, threatening to reach epidemic proportions. A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out over a three-month period at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka to identify the underlying etiologic factors for the disease in a cohort of patients with chronic kidney disease. A total of 200 patients were studied with a mean age of 50. 57 years. Of them, 108 (54%) were in chronic kidney disease stage V. Majority of the patients were from the western province (137, 68. 5%) with only five (2. 5%) from provinces with high prevalence of chronic kidney disease-u. The most common underlying causes of chronic kidney disease were diabetes (88, 44%) and hypertension (34, 17%). However, in patients younger than 40 years of age the most common cause was glomerulonephritis (20, 42. 6%). Diabetes was the most common cause of chronic kidney disease among patients from the western province (74, 54%). The prevalence of chronic kidney disease-u was twice as high in patients from areas outside the western province compared with patients from this province (P 0. 05). The low prevalence of chronic kidney disease-u in the study population could be the result of poor representation of patients from provinces with high prevalence of chronic kidney disease-u. Introduction stage renal disease (end-stage renal disease), there are more than 200 with overt chronic kidney disease (stage III or IV) and Chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) is fast becoalmost 5000 with covert disease (stage I or II). 2 ming a global epidemic. 1 Data from the United Unfortunately, such data are not available for States suggest that for every patient with endmost of the developing countries, including Sri Correspondence to: Lanka. chronic kidney disease is a growing problem in Sri Lanka.

    "chronic kidney disease of uncertain or unknown etiology is an entity described in certain provinces of Sri Lanka. The geographic distribution of chronic kidney disease-u appears to be based toward the northern regions of the country in which the north central, part of north western, and part of Uva provinces are included. The population at risk are scattered in the north central region with high prevalence observed at Medawachchiya, Padaviya, Dehiattakandiya, Girandurukotte, Medirigiriya and recently Nikawewa (Figure 1). This entity was discovered when several studies failed to identify a specific cause for chronic kidney disease in the vast majority of the patients from these areas. For example, a recent study which was carried Figure 1. Map of Sri Lanka showing areas with out among chronic kidney disease patients attending the outpatient high prevalence of chronic kidney disease of clinics of Kandy and Anuradhapura hospitals, unknown etiology. which provide services for most of these chronic kidney disease-u countries. 4, 5 This observation is further highareas, revealed that 54% and 82% of patients, respectively, were not identified to have a spelighted in our study. These findings were sicific cause for the disease. 6 This is in contrast to milar to the results of the previous study conducted three years earlier in the same institute. 9 the reported prevalence of chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology in other parts of the world, which ranges In that study, conducted by Gooneratne et al, at from 6. 2% to 14. 7%. 10 The majority of the the National hospital of Sri Lanka in 2006, affected patients were young males engaged in diabetic nephropathy was the leading cause of paddy farming who belonged to low sociochronic kidney disease with a prevalence of 30. 6%.
