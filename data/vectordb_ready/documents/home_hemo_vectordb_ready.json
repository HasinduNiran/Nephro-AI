ORG 3 Introduction When you are told that you have kidney failure and need treatment to stay alive, it can be a difficult and challenging time in your life. You may have many concerns. These concerns can be physical, emotional, and financial. If your kidney disease diagnosis is recent, you may feel overwhelmed, confused, and angry. You may worry about how kidney failure and dialysis will change your future and your quality of life. But there are some important things you can do to help yourself. Learn all you can about your treatment options. Take an active role in decisions about your care. 4 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Kidney failure can be treated with hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or kidney transplantation. Reviewing the pros and cons of each of these options can help you and your healthcare professional decide what is best for you. This booklet is about a special type of hemodialysis hemodialysis done at home, or home hemodialysis.",
    "This booklet is about a special type of hemodialysis hemodialysis done at home, or home hemodialysis. See for a list of resources on the other treatment options. How hemodialysis works Hemodialysis is a treatment that replaces some of the work of your own kidneys. Hemodialysis clears wastes and extra fluid from your blood. Your blood is cleaned by a part of the dialysis machine called the artificial kidney or dialyzer. For blood to flow through the dialysis machine, you need to have an access, or entrance, to your bloodstream. This is created by minor surgery, usually to an arm. (See Getting an access on. ) At each dialysis treatment, two needles are placed into the dialysis access site in your arm; one needle carries your blood through sterile tubing to the artificial kidney (dialyzer), and your cleaned blood is returned to your body through the second needle. Home hemodialysis Hemodialysis can be done at home. When you do home hemodialysis, you may be better able to fit your treatments into your daily schedule. If you work, home hemodialysis may make your treatments easier to plan. KIDNEY. ORG 5 Studies show that the more you know about your treatment and the more you do on your own, the better you are likely to feel on dialysis. If your doctor recommended hemodialysis as the best treatment option for you, hemodialysis at home may be a good choice. A brief history of home hemodialysis Home hemodialysis began in the United States in 1964. By 1973, when Medicare first covered dialysis costs, 40 percent of patients received their hemodialysis at home. With the start of Medicare payments for dialysis, more centers began to open. In 2008, new regulations were established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the government agency responsible for Medicare. Now, dialysis centers are required to inform patients about the option of home dialysis. Your dialysis team members must provide you with a list of places that will train you how to do home hemodialysis. The regulations require that people with severe kidney disease and kidney failure receive information about all possible treatment options. Medicare covers up to 80% of the cost of home hemodialysis, just as they do for dialysis in a hospital or other treatment center. Medicare may help cover the cost of minor plumbing or electrical modifications to your home for home hemodialysis. 6 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION KIDNEY.

(See Getting an access on. ) KIDNEY. ORG 9 Different schedules of home hemodialysis You can do hemodialysis at home using one of three types of schedules. Whichever schedule you choose, you will be trained to perform dialysis safely and to handle any problems that may arise. Everyone is different and training time differs between people, but usually takes three to eight weeks. 1. Conventional home hemodialysis: You perform hemodialysis three times a week for three to four hours or longer each time. 2. Short daily home hemodialysis: This schedule calls for hemodialysis five to seven times a week, using machines designed for short, daily home treatment. Treatments usually last about two hours each. Because you are receiving dialysis more often, less fluid needs to be removed from 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION your blood each time.",
    "This reduces recovery symptoms like headaches, nausea, cramping, and feeling washed out after your treatment. 3. Nocturnal (nighttime) home hemodialysis: These are longer, slower treatments done at night while you sleep. You may receive this kind of dialysis six nights a week or every other night. It depends on what your doctor recommends for you. Treatments usually last about six to eight hours. Some centers monitor your treatments by having information from your dialysis machine sent to a staffed location via telephone modem or the Internet. More hours of dialysis each week can increase waste removal from your blood. Its also possible to combine daily and nocturnal home hemodialysis. Whether you can combine treatments depends on your needs, your health, and your dialysis machine. Whatever treatment schedule you choose, its important to know if you are receiving the right amount of dialysis. Blood tests are done regularly during the year to check on the amount of dialysis you receive and to help decide if any adjustments to your treatment plan are needed. For more information on how the amount of dialysis is measured, speak with your doctor and your dialysis care team. KIDNEY. ORG 11 Added benefits of short daily and nocturnal home hemodialysis Having frequent dialysis is closer to how your kidneys functioned when they were healthy. Many reports indicate that people who use short daily and nocturnal home hemodialysis: Take less medication to control high blood pressure and anemia (low red blood cell count) Take less medication to keep high blood phosphorus under control Have improved blood pressure, nerve damage, and symptoms of restless leg syndrome Feel better during dialysis and less washed out after dialysis Have fewer limits on what they can eat and drink Have more energy Sleep better Have fewer and shorter hospital stays Have a better quality of life Live longer With daily home hemodialysis, you dont have the swings in your blood chemistries and fluids like you do when you dont dialyze every day, so you feel a lot better. Home dialysis is for people who want to be in control of the process and be at home. David J. , patient on daily home hemodialysis 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Deciding if home hemodialysis is right for you Home hemodialysis is not a good fit for everyone. You will need to find a dialysis center that offers training and support in home hemodialysis. You must also be willing to be responsible for your own treatment. The following are questions you may want to discuss with your doctor, your employer, and healthcare team. Questions to consider YOUR JOB: Can I keep my job and do home hemodialysis? Can I get paid time off to train for home hemodialysis? If I quit working, how long can I keep my health insurance? Can I get other health insurance? How will this change affect my family and me? KIDNEY. ORG 13 FINDING A HOME HEMODIALYSIS PROGRAM Does my local dialysis center offer home hemodialysis training? If not, where is the closest center with training? Am I willing to change centers, or even doctors, to get home hemodialysis? How far would I be willing to go for training that takes several weeks and for clinic visits every four to six weeks? How long does training take? What is the training schedule? How will I learn to put the needles in my arm for hemodialysis? Who will be my trainer? Can I make an appointment to talk with them? 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION CHANGES AT HOME What will it take to install a dialysis machine in my house?",
    "14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION CHANGES AT HOME What will it take to install a dialysis machine in my house? Will my landlord allow me to put a dialysis machine in my apartment? Where can I put the equipment and supplies? What are the rules about the disposal of medical waste in my area? How much will my insurance pay for training and home hemodialysis supplies? COSTS What out-of-pocket costs will I need to pay? Will insurance pay for any necessary changes in my home? How much will my electric, gas, and water bills increase? WORKING WITH THE DIALYSIS CENTER How will the dialysis center staff support me once Im doing treatment at home? Who repairs my machine when it breaks? How long do repairs usually take? Where can I get dialysis if my machine is broken? How often do I need to come back to the center for clinic visits? Is transportation assistance available if I need a ride to the clinic? Can I see my local doctor monthly, so I wont have to come to the clinic as often? KIDNEY. ORG 15 LONG-TERM CONCERNS: What treatment does my kidney doctor believe is best? Why? Will I do better long-term with home hemodialysis? New technology More user-friendly dialysis machines are being developed for home use. These machines are easier to set up, clean, and disinfect and have easy-to-use alarms to alert you to a problem. With some newer machines, there are fewer supplies to store. If you and your doctor think home hemodialysis is a good choice for you, ask your dialysis training staff about the best equipment for you. With daily dialysis, Ive noticed that I have increased energy, better sleep, and improved concentration at work. People shouldnt have to live to dialyze. Daily home hemodialysis on your own schedule makes it possible to live life as best you can. Bill P. , a patient on daily home hemodialysis 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Finding a center that offers home hemodialysis Your healthcare professional will help you find a dialysis center that has a home hemodialysis program certified by CMS. If your center does not offer home hemodialysis, see for websites that can help you find centers that offer home hemodialysis. Visit the center. Talk with the home training nurse and other staff. Ask to speak to patients who do home dialysis. Two things will ensure your success: 1. a dialysis center and nurse willing to train you and follow your care; and 2. your commitment to learn and do hemodialysis at home. KIDNEY. ORG 17 Staying in touch with your dialysis center You will need to visit your dialysis center about once a month for a check-up, lab tests, and to see your kidney doctor, nurse, dietitian, and social worker. You may also need to receive some of your medicines, such as intravenous iron, at your center. Between visits to the center, your healthcare team is there to help. If you have a question about your diet or treatment, call your center. When you go home after your training, your center will give you phone numbers that you can call if you have questions. Some centers monitor care over the Internet. Keep a list of important phone numbers in a handy place (see ). You can use the chart at the end of this booklet to get started. 18 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Preparing for home hemodialysis Getting an access To do any type of hemodialysis, you need to have a way to gain access to your bloodstream. Your access is created by a doctor called a vascular surgeon.",
    "Your access is created by a doctor called a vascular surgeon. There are three types of access: Fistula: This is the first choice for an access for most people. It has fewer problems and lasts the longest, especially if you are the only person inserting the needles. A fistula involves surgery to connect an artery and a nearby vein, usually in your arm. Have your fistula created early, so it has time to heal and is ready to use when you need to start treatment. KIDNEY. ORG 19 Graft: If the surgeon evaluates your blood vessels and a fistula is not possible, a graft is the second best access choice for hemodialysis. A graft also requires surgery. It is made by connecting an artery and nearby vein with a small, soft tube made of synthetic material. However, a graft is more prone to infection and clotting than a fistula. If that happens, you may need treatment or more surgery to fix or replace the graft. Catheter: Another way to access your bloodstream is to have a plastic tube called a catheter put into a large vein in your neck or chest. Catheters are only used long-term if no other access can be made. Catheters are more prone to infections and clots. If you have a catheter, you must follow strict catheter care instructions to stay healthy. You will learn how to: Set up your equipment in your home Insert and remove your needles Figure out how much fluid to remove from your blood during dialysis Use and care for your dialysis machine and water system (if needed) Notice and handle medical and equipment problems that may occur Store and order your supplies Check your blood pressure 20 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Paying for home hemodialysis Insurance coverage The social worker at your dialysis center should give you information about coverage for home hemodialysis and other costs that may be related to receiving your treatment at home. Medicare pays for part of the cost of home hemodialysis and training. Medicare is not just for people who are 65 and older. The program also helps Americans and legal residents of all ages who need dialysis or a kidney transplant and qualify for coverage. Other sources that help pay for dialysis include: Private insurance Some managed care organizations Medicaid Veterans Administration Indian Health Service (IHS) KIDNEY. ORG 21 If you have an employer group health plan, it will be the primary coverage for the first 30 months of your treatment, with Medicare as your secondary insurer. After those first 30 months, Medicare will become your primary insurance. Your home training nurse will tell you if your home will need plumbing or wiring changes for home hemodialysis. Some of these costs may be covered by private insurance or your center. You may be given the option of receiving your dialysis supplies from your dialysis center or dealing directly with a supply company. You can expect your monthly water and electric bills to increase a little. Speak to your social worker if you have additional questions or concerns about coverage for home hemodialysis. 22 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION I started feeling stronger and more energetic. I had less bone pain, so I was able to walk more and started exercising regularly. I stopped taking some medications and I generally feel good. With home dialysis, you do everything from setting up the machine, connecting and disconnecting yourself to the machine, and disinfecting the machine afterwards. But taken as a whole, the positives far outweigh the negatives. Henry E. , a patient on nocturnal home hemodialysis KIDNEY.",
    "Henry E. , a patient on nocturnal home hemodialysis KIDNEY. ORG 23 Summary Key points to remember Pros of home hemodialysis Its easier to fit into your daily or weekly schedule. There are fewer restrictions on what you can eat and drink, especially for those doing daily or nocturnal treatment. You are in control of your own treatment and have more independence. Your health over time is likely to be better. Many patients say they feel better and have more energy. Three basic types of hemodialysis can be performed at home: Conventionalthree times a week for three to four hours or longer each time Short dailyfive to seven times a week for about two hours each time Nocturnalthree to six nights a week for six to eight hours each time. Talk to your healthcare practitioner about whether home hemodialysis would be a good treatment choice for you. They can also help you choose the best type of home hemodialysis for your needs. To perform hemodialysis, you will need to have a permanent access to your blood created. Doctors recommend a fistula for most patients. 24 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Both you and a care partner (in most cases) will need to be trained to do home hemodialysis. Your care partner may be a family member, friend, or a healthcare worker whom you hire to assist you. Medicare, private insurance, and several other sources pay for home hemodialysis. Speak to your social worker if you have any questions. Even though you will be at home, you still need to keep in touch with your dialysis center for monthly checkups, questions, and in case of problems. KIDNEY.
