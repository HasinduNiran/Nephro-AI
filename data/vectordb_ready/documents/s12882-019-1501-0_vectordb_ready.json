The cause is still unknown. The objective of this study was to describe the incidence, prevalence and trendof CKD/CKDu in North Central Province ofSri Lanka. Methods: A cross sectional survey conductedin North Central Provincewith GPS mapping inCKDu highly affected areas. The diagnosis of CKDand staging were made according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes paper. Descriptive statistics used with chi-square test for evaluating dichotomous variables. Log rank test was used to compare survival rates. The population data was obtained from the 2011 Census. Results: There were 30, 566 CKD/CKDu patients inthe North Central Province. Incidence of0. 10 in 2009, 0. 39 in 2016 inAnuradhapura district, decreased slightly to 0. 29 in2017. Incidence of 0. 09 in 2009, 0. 46 in 2016 in Polonnaruwa district, decreased slightly to 0. 41 in2017. The point prevalence inhighincidence areas ranged from 2. 444. 35. The 5year survival rate was 71. 2 (Anuradhapura 72. 4 and Polonnaruwa 68. 3, p0. 0212). More than70, 40 and 33%of patients were over 50, 60 and 70years of age respectively. A male preponderance was seen in allthe divisional areas (ranging from 1. 3: 1 to 2. 6: 1) and inall theage groups. Farmers were themost affected (70. 6% Anuradhapura district and 65. 1% Polonnaruwa district). Majority in CKD stage I(4943, 69. 6%). There were 1685 deaths (17. 5%of total CKD/CKDupatients, 67. 6% oftotal deaths in CKD/CKDu patients) occurring within the first3years ofdiagnosis. GPSmappingshows thatthere is a clustering ofhouseholds with CKD/CKDu.

BMCNephrology (2019) 20: 338 Page2of11 (Continuedfrompreviouspage) Conclusions: The incidence ofCKD/CKDuincreased up to 2016 with a slight decrease in2017. The most vulnerable age group was 40 to 60years. There is a male preponderance. Farmers at a higher risk. Majority were in CKDstage 1. Morethantwo thirds ofthedeaths ofCKD/CKDu patients occurred within three years ofdiagnosis with disparities in 5year survival rate among thetwo districts. There is clustering of cases.
