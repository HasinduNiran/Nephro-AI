Dialysis is a life-sustaining treatment that performs the filtering functions of healthy kidneys when they can no longer adequately remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood. There are two main types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, each with distinct mechanisms, advantages, and considerations. The choice between these modalities depends on medical factors, lifestyle preferences, and individual patient circumstances.

Hemodialysis is the most common form of dialysis, used by approximately 90% of dialysis patients worldwide. During hemodialysis, blood is removed from the body through a vascular access point, passed through a dialyzer (artificial kidney) containing a semi-permeable membrane, where waste products and excess fluids are removed, and then returned to the body. A typical hemodialysis session lasts 3-4 hours and is performed three times per week at a dialysis center, though home hemodialysis and more frequent schedules are increasingly available.

Vascular access for hemodialysis is critical and can be achieved through three main methods: arteriovenous fistula (AVF), arteriovenous graft (AVG), or central venous catheter. An AVF is considered the gold standard as it is created by surgically connecting an artery to a vein, usually in the arm, allowing the vein to enlarge and strengthen over 2-3 months before it can be used for dialysis. AVFs have the lowest infection rates and longest functional lifespan compared to other access types.

Arteriovenous grafts are synthetic tubes that connect an artery to a vein when a patient's blood vessels are not suitable for creating a fistula. Grafts can typically be used within 2-3 weeks after surgical placement, making them available sooner than fistulas. However, they have higher rates of infection and clotting compared to fistulas and generally require more interventions to maintain patency over time.

Central venous catheters are plastic tubes inserted into large veins, typically in the neck, chest, or groin, and are used when immediate dialysis access is needed or when fistulas and grafts are not possible. While catheters provide immediate access, they carry the highest risk of infection and blood clots and are associated with poorer dialysis adequacy. They are generally considered temporary solutions while permanent access is being established.

Peritoneal dialysis uses the peritoneum, the membrane lining the abdominal cavity, as a natural filter for removing waste products and excess fluid. Dialysis solution is infused into the abdomen through a permanently placed catheter, where it absorbs waste products through diffusion and removes excess fluid through osmosis. After a dwell time of several hours, the used solution is drained and replaced with fresh solution.

Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is a manual form of peritoneal dialysis performed by the patient typically 4-5 times per day, every day. Each exchange takes about 30-40 minutes and can be done at home, work, or while traveling. CAPD provides continuous, gentle filtration that more closely mimics natural kidney function and offers greater flexibility and independence compared to hemodialysis.

Automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) uses a machine called a cycler to automatically perform exchanges during sleep. The cycler is programmed to fill, dwell, and drain the dialysis solution multiple times overnight over 8-10 hours. APD is particularly suitable for working patients or those who prefer to avoid daytime exchanges, though some may require an additional manual exchange during the day for adequate clearance.

Dialysis adequacy measures how well dialysis is removing waste products and maintaining fluid balance. For hemodialysis, adequacy is typically measured using Kt/V, which considers the dialyzer clearance, treatment time, and patient's body water volume, with a minimum target of 1.2 for thrice-weekly treatments. For peritoneal dialysis, adequacy is assessed through weekly clearance measurements and residual kidney function, with targets individualized based on patient size and residual renal function.

Common complications of hemodialysis include hypotension during treatment, muscle cramps, access-related infections or clotting, anemia, and bone disease. Patients may experience fatigue after dialysis sessions and require 1-2 hours of recovery time. Long-term hemodialysis can lead to cardiovascular complications, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and dialysis-related amyloidosis. Regular monitoring and preventive care are essential to minimize these complications.

Peritoneal dialysis complications include peritonitis (infection of the peritoneum), which can occur several times per year and requires prompt antibiotic treatment. Exit-site and tunnel infections around the catheter are also risks. Over time, the peritoneal membrane may lose its filtering capacity, a condition called membrane failure. Hernias can develop due to increased intra-abdominal pressure, and some patients may experience weight gain from glucose absorption from the dialysis solution.

Dietary requirements for dialysis patients differ from those with earlier stage CKD. Hemodialysis patients typically need to limit fluids, potassium, phosphorus, and sodium while ensuring adequate protein intake of 1.2-1.5 g/kg body weight daily. Peritoneal dialysis patients often have more liberal fluid and potassium allowances but may need to monitor calories due to glucose absorption from dialysate. All dialysis patients require careful management of phosphorus through dietary restriction and phosphate binders.

Fluid management is crucial for dialysis patients, particularly those on hemodialysis who must limit fluid intake between treatments. Excessive fluid gain can lead to shortness of breath, high blood pressure, heart strain, and dangerous complications during dialysis such as severe hypotension or cramping. Most hemodialysis patients are advised to limit fluid intake to 1-1.5 liters per day, while peritoneal dialysis patients may have more flexibility depending on their residual kidney function and ultrafiltration capacity.

Quality of life on dialysis varies significantly among patients and is influenced by factors including dialysis modality, treatment schedule, symptom burden, complications, and psychosocial support. Studies show that peritoneal dialysis patients often report better quality of life in the first few years, while home hemodialysis provides greater flexibility than in-center treatments. Comprehensive patient education, shared decision-making, and addressing both physical and psychological needs are essential for optimizing outcomes.

Survival rates for dialysis patients have improved over time but remain lower than the general population, with 5-year survival rates around 40-50% for hemodialysis patients. Factors affecting survival include age, underlying cause of kidney disease, presence of comorbidities (especially diabetes and cardiovascular disease), dialysis adequacy, nutritional status, and anemia management. Younger patients without significant comorbidities generally have better outcomes.

Home dialysis, including both home hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, is increasingly recognized as beneficial for suitable patients. Home dialysis offers greater flexibility, independence, and the ability to dialyze more frequently or for longer durations. More frequent dialysis (5-6 times per week) has been associated with better blood pressure control, reduced medication requirements, improved quality of life, and potentially better survival, though it requires significant patient commitment and adequate home support.
