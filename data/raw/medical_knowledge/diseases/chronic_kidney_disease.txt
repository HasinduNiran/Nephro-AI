Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. It develops slowly over time, often taking months or years before symptoms become noticeable. CKD is classified into five stages based on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), with stage 5 being the most severe and often requiring dialysis or transplantation.

The most common causes of chronic kidney disease include diabetes and high blood pressure, which together account for approximately two-thirds of all CKD cases. Diabetes damages the small blood vessels in the kidneys, reducing their filtering capacity, while hypertension puts excessive strain on the kidney's delicate filtering system. Other causes include glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, prolonged urinary tract obstruction, and recurrent kidney infections.

Early stages of CKD often present no symptoms, making regular screening crucial for at-risk populations. As the disease progresses, patients may experience fatigue, swelling in the legs and ankles, decreased urine output, difficulty concentrating, poor appetite, and sleep problems. Advanced CKD can lead to complications such as anemia, bone disease, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiovascular disease.

Diagnosis of chronic kidney disease involves multiple tests including blood tests to measure serum creatinine and estimate GFR, urine tests to detect protein or blood, and imaging studies such as ultrasound or CT scans. A kidney biopsy may be performed in certain cases to determine the underlying cause and extent of kidney damage. Regular monitoring of kidney function is essential for patients diagnosed with CKD.

Management of CKD focuses on slowing disease progression and preventing complications. This includes strict control of blood pressure and blood sugar levels, medications to reduce proteinuria, dietary modifications to reduce kidney workload, and regular monitoring of kidney function. Patients are advised to avoid nephrotoxic medications, maintain a healthy weight, quit smoking, and stay physically active within their capacity.

Stage 1 CKD is characterized by kidney damage with normal or high GFR (≥90 mL/min/1.73m²), often detected through urine tests showing protein or blood. At this stage, kidney function is essentially normal, but there is evidence of structural damage. Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause and implementing lifestyle modifications to prevent progression.

Stage 2 CKD involves mild reduction in kidney function with GFR between 60-89 mL/min/1.73m². Patients may still be asymptomatic, but early intervention is critical. This includes managing blood pressure, controlling diabetes if present, and adopting a kidney-friendly diet. Regular follow-up with healthcare providers every 6-12 months is recommended.

Stage 3 CKD is divided into 3a (GFR 45-59) and 3b (GFR 30-44) and represents moderate kidney function loss. Symptoms may begin to appear at this stage, including fatigue, fluid retention, and changes in urination patterns. Patients require more frequent monitoring, typically every 3-6 months, and may need specialist nephrology care. Medication adjustments are often necessary as the kidneys' ability to clear drugs decreases.

Stage 4 CKD indicates severe kidney damage with GFR between 15-29 mL/min/1.73m². At this stage, patients typically experience noticeable symptoms and complications such as anemia, bone disease, high blood pressure, and metabolic acidosis. Preparation for renal replacement therapy should begin, including education about dialysis and transplantation options, creation of vascular access for dialysis, and evaluation for transplant candidacy.

Stage 5 CKD, also called end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or kidney failure, occurs when GFR falls below 15 mL/min/1.73m². At this stage, the kidneys have lost most of their ability to function, and renal replacement therapy in the form of dialysis or kidney transplantation becomes necessary for survival. Symptoms are severe and include buildup of waste products causing uremia, which can affect multiple organ systems.

The prognosis of CKD varies depending on the stage at diagnosis, underlying cause, and how well risk factors are controlled. Early detection and proper management can significantly slow progression and improve quality of life. However, once kidney function declines below a certain point, progression to end-stage disease becomes more likely even with optimal treatment.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in CKD patients, with risk increasing as kidney function declines. The relationship between CKD and heart disease is bidirectional, as kidney dysfunction contributes to cardiovascular problems through mechanisms including hypertension, fluid overload, anemia, and mineral-bone disorders. Aggressive cardiovascular risk management is therefore a critical component of CKD care.

Diabetic kidney disease, also known as diabetic nephropathy, is the leading cause of CKD in developed countries. It typically develops after 5-10 years of diabetes and is characterized by progressive albuminuria and declining GFR. Tight glycemic control with HbA1c targets below 7% can significantly reduce the risk of developing or worsening diabetic kidney disease. Use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs is recommended for patients with diabetes and albuminuria.

Hypertensive nephropathy results from long-standing high blood pressure damaging the blood vessels in the kidneys. Blood pressure targets for CKD patients are generally more stringent, with guidelines recommending below 130/80 mmHg for most patients. Multiple antihypertensive medications may be required to achieve target blood pressure, with ACE inhibitors or ARBs preferred as first-line therapy due to their kidney-protective effects.

Proteinuria, the presence of excess protein in urine, is both a sign of kidney damage and a risk factor for CKD progression. The degree of proteinuria correlates with the rate of kidney function decline and cardiovascular risk. Reducing proteinuria through medications such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs is an important treatment goal. Patients with significant proteinuria require closer monitoring and more aggressive treatment.
