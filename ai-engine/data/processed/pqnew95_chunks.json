    "text": "Chronic Kidney Disease chronic kidney disease Archive Chronic Kidney Disease (chronic kidney disease) Guideline (2010) Chronic Kidney Disease chronic kidney disease: Major Recommendations (2010) Recommendations are categorized in terms of either conditional or imperative statements. While conditional statements clearly define a specific situation, imperative statements are broadly applicable to the target population and do not impose restraints on their application. Conditional recommendations are presented in an if/then format, such that: If CONDITION then ACTION(S) because REASON(S) Fulfillment of the condition triggers one or more guideline-specified actions. In contrast, imperative recommendations include terms such as require, must, and should, and do not contain conditional text that would limit their applicability to specified circumstances. Resources Available with Each Recommendation In addition to the recommendation statement and strength rating, you will find on each recommendation page: A brief narrative summary of the evidence analyzed to reach the recommendation A statement of justification, or reason for the strength of the recommendation Detailed information on the evidence supporting the recommendations and background narrative (available in the Supporting Evidence section toward the bottom of each recommendation page) A reference list at the end of each recommendation page that includes all the sources used in the evidence analysis for the particular recommendation (each reference is hyperlinked to a summary of the article analyzed in the evidence analysis). Below, you will find a list of the Chronic Kidney Disease Recommendations, organized according to the stage of the Nutrition Care Process and by topic. To see the Recommendation Summary, just click on the Recommendation title.

To see more detail on the evidence from which the following recommendations were drawn, use the hyperlinks in the Supporting Evidence Section below. Recommendation(s) chronic kidney disease: Medical Nutrition Therapy Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) provided by a registered dietitian (RD) is recommended for individuals with chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease, Stages One to Five including post-Kidney transplant). MNT prevents and treats Protein-energy malnutrition and mineral and electrolyte disorders and minimizes the impact of other comorbidities on the progression of Kidney disease (e. g. , Diabetes, obesity, hypertension and disorders of lipid metabolism). Studies regarding effectiveness of MNT report significant improvements in anthropometric and biochemical measurements sustained for at least one year. Rating: Strong Imperative chronic kidney disease: Initiation of Medical Nutrition Therapy Referral for MNT per federal or state guidelines, should be initiated at diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, in order to maintain adequate nutritional status, prevent disease progression and delay renal replacement therapy (RRT). MNT should be initiated at least 12 months prior to the anticipation of RRT (Dialysis or transplant). Rating: Strong Imperative chronic kidney disease: Frequency of Medical Nutrition Therapy Depending on the care setting and the initiation of MNT, the RD should monitor the nutritional status of individuals with chronic kidney disease every one to three months and more frequently if there is inadequate nutrient intake, Protein-energy malnutrition, mineral and electrolyte disorders or the presence of an illness that may worsen nutritional status, as these are predictive of increased mortality risk. Research related to the time requirements for MNT provided by an RD indicate that approximately two hours per month for up to one year may be required to provide an effective intervention for adults with chronic kidney disease. Rating: Strong Conditional Risks/Harms of Implementing This Recommendation None. Conditions of Application For the recommendation on Frequency of Medical Nutrition Therapy, frequency of care may depend on the care setting (i. e. , acute care, long-term care, outpatient care, etc. ). It should be noted that RDs with National Provider Identification (NPI) numbers in the Medicare system are specifically designated as qualified to provide MNT services to Medicare beneficiaries. At the time of guideline development in 2010, covered diagnoses include: Non-dialyzed chronic kidney disease with renal function of 13ml to 50ml per minute per 1. 73m2, post-renal transplant up to three years and Diabetes mellitus. Private third-party insurance carriers may or may not follow similar diagnostic guidelines for coverage.",

    "text": "Private third-party insurance carriers may or may not follow similar diagnostic guidelines for coverage. Some carriers may offer a limited number of RDs as in-network providers. The ADA chronic kidney disease expert workgroup agrees that RD providers of MNT who have additional expertise in renal disease management may be preferred for persons with chronic kidney disease. Patients may choose to engage an RD with renal experience by selecting a qualified out-of-network provider or by electing to receive MNT sessions on a self-pay basis. Potential Costs Associated with Application Although costs of MNT sessions and reimbursement vary, MNT sessions are essential for improved outcomes. Recommendation Narrative Research related to the time requirements for MNT provided by an RD indicate that approximately two hours per month for up to one year may be required to provide an effective intervention for adults with chronic kidney disease.

From the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines for Nutrition in Chronic Renal Failure (2000) Guideline 26: Intensive Nutritional Counseling for Chronic Renal Failure (chronic renal failure) The nutritional status of individuals with chronic renal failure should be monitored at regular intervals (Evidence) A spontaneous reduction in dietary Protein intake (DPI) and a progressive decline in indices of nutritional status occur in many non-dialyzed patients with chronic renal failure The presence of Protein-energy malnutrition at the initiation of maintenance Dialysis is predictive of future mortality risk Interventions that maintain or improve nutritional status during progressive renal failure are likely to be associated with improved long-term survival after commencement of maintenance Dialysis Because evidence of Protein-energy malnutrition may develop before individuals require renal replacement therapy, regular monitoring (e. g. , at oneto three-month intervals) of the patients nutritional status should be a routine component of the care for the patient with chronic renal failure Nutritional status should be assessed more frequently if there is inadequate nutrient intake, frank Protein-energy malnutrition or the presence of an illness that may worsen nutritional status. Appendix IV: Role of the Renal Dietitian Implicit in many of the guidelines in this document is the availability to the patient of an individual with expertise in renal dietetics Implementation of many of the guidelines concerning nutritional assessment (anthropometry, subjective global assessment, dietary interviews and diaries and integration of the results of nutritional measurements) and nutritional therapy (developing a plan for nutritional management, counseling the patient and his or her family on appropriate dietary Protein and energy intake, monitoring nutrient intake, educational activities and encouragement to maximize dietary compliance) is best performed by an individual who is trained and experienced in these tasks Although occasionally a physician, nurse or another individual may possess the expertise and time to conduct such activities, a registered dietitian, trained and experienced in renal nutrition, usually is best qualified to carry out these tasks.",

    "text": "Recommendation Strength Rationale Conclusion statement received Grade I The ADA chronic kidney disease Expert Work Group concurs with the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines for Nutrition in Chronic Renal Failure. Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative group members accepted the guideline statements as valid if the median panel rating was seven or greater on a scale of one to nine. The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) evidence analysis process began in 1995 and it has evolved since that time. ADA recommendations were graded when based on more recent Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines since they were developed using methods of evidence analysis that are comparable to the ADA evidence analysis process. Many Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines were supported by expert opinion and therefore were graded as Consensus by the ADA chronic kidney disease Expert Work Group. During the development of these guidelines, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) international evidence-based guidelines were also under development and will be incorporated into future revision of these guidelines. Please check the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative website ( www. Kidney. org) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes website ( www.

Normalized Protein nitrogen appearance (nPNA) or dietary interviews and diaries (evidence and opinion). Appendix III: Dietary Interviews and Diaries There are several methods for estimating dietary nutrient intake. The most common methods are food intake records and dietary recalls. The dietary recall (usually obtained for the previous 24 hours) is a simple, rapid method of obtaining a crude assessment of dietary intake. It can be performed in approximately 30 minutes, does not require the patient to keep records and relies on the patients ability to remember how much food was eaten during the previous 24 hours. Accurate quantification of the amounts of foods eaten is critical for the 24-hour recall. Various models of foods and measuring devices are used to estimate portion sizes. Advantages to the recall method are that respondents usually will not be able to modify their eating behavior in anticipation of a dietary evaluation and they do not have to be literate. Disadvantages of the 24-hour recall include its reliance on memory (which may be particularly limiting in the elderly), that the responses may be less accurate or unrepresentative of typical intakes and that it must be obtained by a trained and skilled dietitian. Dietary diaries are written reports of foods eaten during a specified length of time. A food-intake record, lasting for several (three to seven) days, provides a more reliable estimate of an individuals nutrient intake than do single-day records. Records kept for more than three days increase the likelihood of inaccurate reporting because an individuals motivation has been shown to decrease with an increasing number of days of dietary data collection, especially if the days are consecutive. On the other hand, records maintained for shorter times may not provide accurate data on usual food and nutrient intakes. The actual number of days chosen to collect food records should depend on the degree of accuracy needed, the day-to-day variability in the intake of the nutrient being measured and the cooperation of the patient. The validity and reliability of the dietary interviews and diaries depend on the patients ability to provide accurate data and the ability of the nutritionist to conduct detailed, probing interviews. The intake of nutrients is generally calculated using computer-based programs. Food records must be maintained meticulously to maximize the accuracy of the diary. Food intake should be recorded at the time the food is eaten, to minimize reliance on memory. Special data collection forms and instructions are provided to assist the individual to record adequate detail. Recording error can be minimized if instructions and proper directions on how to approximate portion sizes and servings of fluid are provided. Food models are also helpful for instruction. The food record should indicate the time of day of any intake (both meals and snacks), the names of foods eaten, the approximate amount ingested, the method of preparation and special recipes or steps taken in the food preparation. The dietitian should carefully review the food record with the patient for accuracy and completeness shortly after it is completed.

To see more detail on the evidence from which the following recommendations were drawn, use the hyperlinks in the Supporting Evidence Section below. Recommendation(s) chronic kidney disease: Use Clinical Judgment in Assessing Body Weight Due to the absence of standard reference norms in the chronic Kidney disease population ( chronic kidney disease, including post Kidney transplant), the registered dietitian (RD) should use clinical judgment to determine which data to include in estimations of body weight: Actual measured weight History of weight changes (both long-term and recent) Serial weight measurements, monitored longitudinally Adjustments for suspected impact of Edema, ascites and polycystic organs. Body weight estimates are used for calculation of nutritional needs, such as Protein and energy requirements. Body weight can be difficult to determine because as Kidney function declines, the ability to regulate fluid balance may be compromised and multiple factors must be considered. Rating: Consensus Imperative chronic kidney disease: Use Published Weight Norms with Caution The RD may use other published weight norms in the anthropometric assessment of individuals with chronic kidney disease (including post Kidney transplant), but each norm has significant drawbacks and must be used with caution: Ideal body weight (IBW) is the body weight associated with the lowest mortality for a given height, age, sex and frame size and is based on the Metropolitan Life Insurance Height and Weight Tables. Caution: Not generalizable to the chronic kidney disease population and data-gathering methods were not standardized. Hamwi Method determines the optimal body weight. Caution: A quick and easy method for determining optimal body weight, but has no scientific data to support its use. Standard Body Weight, NHANES II (SBW as per Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Nutrition Practice Guidelines) describes the median body weight of average Americans from 1976 to 1980 for height, age, sex and frame size.",

    "text": "Caution: Although data is validated and standardized and uses a large database of ethnically-diverse groups, data is provided only on what individuals weigh, not what they should weigh in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. Body Mass Index (body mass index) often defines generalized obesity and chronic kidney disease research, specific to Dialysis patients, has identified that patients at higher BMIs have a lower mortality risk. Caution: The researchers may not have statistically adjusted for all confounders related to comorbid conditions occurring in chronic kidney disease on Dialysis (Diabetes, malignancy, etc) and it is unclear how it may relate to chronic kidney disease patients not on Dialysis. Adjusted Body Weight (ABW) is based on the theory that 25% of the excess body weight (adipose tissue) in obese patients is metabolically active tissue. Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative supports the concept of subtracting 25% for obese patients and adding 25% for underweight patients. Caution: This has not been validated for use in chronic kidney disease and may either overestimate or underestimate energy and Protein requirements. Body weight estimates are used for calculation of nutritional needs, such as Protein and energy requirements. Body weight can be difficult to determine because as Kidney function declines, the ability to regulate fluid balance may be compromised and multiple factors must be considered. Rating: Consensus Conditional chronic kidney disease: Assessment of Body Composition The RD should assess the body composition of individuals with chronic kidney disease (including post Kidney transplant). Studies suggest that chronic kidney disease patients exhibit altered body composition, as compared to healthy individuals. Rating: Fair Imperative chronic kidney disease: Methodologies for Body Composition Assessment When assessing the body composition of individuals with chronic kidney disease (including post Kidney transplant), the RD may use any valid measurement methodology, such as anthropometrics (including waist circumference and body mass index) and body compartment estimates. Currently, there is no reference standard for assessing body composition in chronic kidney disease patients and studies do not show that any one test is superior to another in assessing body composition among chronic kidney disease patients. Rating: Fair Imperative Risks/Harms of Implementing This Recommendation None. Copyright Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (A. N. D), Evidence Analysis Library. Printed on: 09/05/19 Conditions of Application Certain recommendations apply to individuals with chronic kidney disease who also have wasting syndrome, cachexia and are overweight or obese Certain recommendations apply to RDs who are trained in subjective global assessment (SGA). Potential Costs Associated with Application Although costs of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) sessions and reimbursement vary, MNT sessions are essential for improved outcomes. Recommendation Narrative Methods used to assess body composition in chronic kidney disease patients include anthropometric measures, DXA, BIA, Creatinine kinetics (CK) and computed tomography (computed tomography) Anthropometry and DXA are the two most often used methods in research studies, but currently there is no reference standard for assessing body composition in chronic kidney disease patients Studies suggest that chronic kidney disease patients exhibit altered body composition, as compared to healthy individuals (Woodrow et al, 1996; Heimburger et al, 2000; Avesani et al, 2004; Rigalleau et al, 2004; Bellizzi et al, 2006; Barreto et al, 2008; Sanches et al, 2008). These results do not show any one test is superior to another in assessing body composition among chronic kidney disease patients.

    "text": "Subsequent to the publication of the guideline reference below, terminology has been updated. From the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines for Nutrition in Chronic Renal Failure (2000) Guideline 23: Panels of Nutrition Measures for Non-Dialyzed Patients For individuals with chronic renal failure (glomerular filtration rate under 20ml per minute), Protein-energy nutritional status should be evaluated by serial measurements of a panel of markers, including at least one value from each of the following clusters 1. Serum albumin 2. Edema-free actual body weight, percentage standard (NHANES II) body weight or SGA 3. Normalized Protein nitrogen appearance (nPNA) or dietary interviews and diaries (evidence and opinion). Appendix VI: Methods for Performing Subjective Global Assessment Healthcare professionals (e. g. , physicians, dietitians and nurses) should undergo a brief training period before using SGA. This training is recommended to increase precision and skill in using SGA. The four items currently used to assess nutritional status are weight change over the past six months; dietary intake and gastrointestinal symptoms; visual assessment of subcutaneous tissue; muscle mass The scores of each of these items are summated to give the SGA rating It is recommended that SGA be used to measure and monitor nutritional status periodically in both maintenance hemodialysis and peritoneal Dialysis patients. Appendix VII: Methods for Performing Anthropometry and Calculating Body Measurements and Reference Tables Standard body weight is the patients actual weight (post-Dialysis), expressed as a percentage of normal body weight for healthy Americans of similar sex, height and age range and skeletal frame size Patients who are less than 90% of normal body weight are considered to be mildly to moderately malnourished and those who are less than 70% of normal body weight are considered severely malnourished Individuals who are 115% to 130% of SBW are considered mildly obese, those between 130% and 150% are moderately obese and those above 150% of SBW are considered to be severely obese Therefore, it is recommended that a target body weight for maintenance Dialysis patients is between 90% and 110% of SBW At present, it is recommended that the NHANES II data be used for the reference source Measuring skinfold thickness at four sites (triceps, biceps, subscapular and iliac crest) that quantify subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness on the limbs and trunk can make an accurate assessment of body fat In a study that measured four-site skinfold anthropometry, a reduction in percentage total body fat was observed in a group of maintenance hemodialysis patients, when compared with controls. Loss of fat from subcutaneous stores occurs proportionally. Therefore, repeated measures in the same patient over time may provide useful information on trends of fat stores. Recommendation Strength Rationale Conclusion statement received Grade II The ADA chronic kidney disease Expert Work Group concurs with the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines for Nutrition in Chronic Renal Failure. The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) evidence analysis process began in 1995 and it has evolved since that time. ADA recommendations were graded when based on more recent Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines since they were developed using methods of evidence analysis that are comparable to the ADA evidence analysis process. Many Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines were supported by expert opinion and therefore were graded as Consensus by the ADA chronic kidney disease Expert Work Group. During the development of these guidelines, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) international evidence-based guidelines were also under development and will be incorporated into future revision of these guidelines.",

Rating: Consensus Conditional Risks/Harms of Implementing This Recommendation For all recommendations, nutrition status must be maintained, including adequate caloric intake and maintenance of lean body mass.

These RCTs show that Protein-restricted diets, inclusive of Low and very-Low Protein diets, ranging from 0. 3g to 0. 7g per kg of body weight per day with total energy intake of 23kcal to 35kcal per kg body weight can slow glomerular filtration rate decline and maintain stable nutrition status in adult non-diabetic patients with chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease). International studies reported additional keto acid analogs and vitamin or mineral supplementation are needed to maintain adequate nutrition status for patients with chronic kidney disease who consume a very-Low Protein diet (0. 3g to 0. 5g per kg body weight per day) (Teplan et al, 2001). Limited evidence suggests that adding keto acid supplements is better than amino acid supplements to slow glomerular filtration rate decline among non-diabetic chronic kidney disease patients who received a very Low-Protein diet (0. 3g per kg body weight per day). For the chronic kidney disease: Protein Intake for Diabetic Nephropathy recommendation: Meta-analysis results of four RCTs and two non-RCTs published before 1996 suggest that patients with diabetic nephropathy who were on dietary Protein restriction diets had significantly reduced rates of glomerular filtration rate decline compared to those on usual Protein diets (Pedrini et al, 1996; Kasiske et al, 1998). However, seven later RCTs involving about four times more patients than the meta-analysis show conflicting findings. Specifically, more recent RCTs (published after 1999) show that a Low-Protein diet (0. 6g to 0. 89g per kg per day) without ketoacid supplementation for up to two years did not significantly alter glomerular filtration rate decline when compared to subjects usual Protein diet (1. 0g to 1. 4g per kg per day), regardless of the stage of chronic kidney disease or type of Diabetes among patients with diabetic nephropathy (Hansen et al, 1999; Meloni et al, 2002; Pijls et al, 2002; Meloni et al, 2004; Dussol et al, 2005). The reported effects on proteinuria or microalbuminuria were inconsistent across studies. Nutrition status can be maintained with either a Low Protein or a usual Protein diet. Data on the effects of Protein-restriction diets on clinical outcomes of renal function are limited. One positive RCT shows that the relative risk of progression to Stage Five chronic kidney disease or overall mortality was significantly reduced 0. 23 (95% CI, 0. 07, 0. 72), P0. 01 for type 1 Diabetes patients assigned to a Low-Protein diet (0. 89g per kg per day), compared to those assigned to a free-Protein diet (Hansen et al, 2002). Results from one RCT suggests that ketoacid supplementation may be needed to preserve renal function among patients who are on a very-Low Protein diet (0. 3g per kg per day) (Prakash et al, 2004).",

To see more detail on the evidence from which the following recommendations were drawn, use the hyperlinks in the Supporting Evidence Section below. Recommendation(s) chronic kidney disease: Energy Intake For adults with chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease, including post Kidney transplant after surgical recovery), the registered dietitian (RD) should recommend or prescribe an energy intake between 23kcal to 35kcal per kg of body weight per day, based on the following factors: Weight status and goals Age and gender Level of physical activity Metabolic stressors. Research reports that energy intakes between 23kcal to 35kcal per kg body weight per day are adequate to prevent signs of malnutrition. Rating: Fair Imperative Risks/Harms of Implementing This Recommendation If an adult with chronic kidney disease is not under the care of an RD, there is an increased risk of Protein-energy malnutrition. Conditions of Application Current state laws and regulations which define the RDs scope of practice should be checked regarding interpretation of terms such as write an order, order changes, initiate, recommend, prescribe, etc. Nutrition prescription privileges may be granted to an RD by the governing body of the hospital or other practice settings.",

Potential Costs Associated with Application Although costs of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) sessions and reimbursement vary, MNT sessions are essential for improved outcomes. Recommendation Narrative chronic kidney disease Patients: Normal Body Weight Data from five RCTs (Bernhard et al, 2001; Teplan et al, 2001; Meloni et al, 2004; Feiten et al, 2005; Mircescu et al, 2007) of patients with normal body weight suggest that a total energy intake of 23kcal to 35kcal per kg body weight (when consuming Protein-restricted diets ranging from 0. 3g to 0. 7g per kg per day) is adequate to maintain stable body mass index in adult non-diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease. Other uncontrolled trials (Ikizler et al, 1995; Chauveau et al, 1999; Zakar et al, 2001; Kaizu et al, 2002; Chauveau et al, 2003; Ideura et al, 2007) and cross-sectional studies (Monteon et al, 1986; Kuhlmann et al, 2001) suggest similar findings. chronic kidney disease Patients: Overweight with Diabetes Data from three RCTs (Meloni et al, 2002; Meloni et al, 2004; Dussol et al, 2005) of overweight chronic kidney disease patients (mean body mass index of approximately 27) with type 1 or type 2 Diabetes suggest that a total energy intake of 1, 780kcal to 1, 823kcal (when consuming Protein-restricted diets ranging from 0. 68g to 0. 86g per kg per day) can decrease body weight without resulting signs of malnutrition. Post-Kidney Transplant Patients Data from one before-and-after trial (Teplan et al, 2003) of obese (mean body mass index, 35. 5) hyperhomocysteinuric patients (definition not given) with a new Kidney transplant (one year post-transplantation), suggest that a diet of less than 30kcal per kg per day can significantly reduce body mass index (mean body mass index, -8kg/m2; P0. 03), LDL-cholesterol (-38mg per dL; P0. 01) and TG (-102mg per dL; P0. 01) after one year. From the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines for Nutrition in Chronic Renal Failure (2000) Guideline 25: Dietary Energy Intake (DEI) for Non-Dialyzed Patients The recommended DEI for individuals with chronic renal failure (chronic renal failure: glomerular filtration rate25ml per minute) who are not undergoing maintenance Dialysis is 35kcal per kg per day for those who are younger than 60 years old and 30kcal to 35kcal per kg per day for individuals who are 60 years of age or older (Evidence and Opinion) Energy expenditure of non-dialyzed individuals with chronic renal failure is similar to that of healthy individuals Metabolic balance studies of such individuals indicate that a diet providing about 35kcal per kg per day engenders neutral nitrogen balance and maintains serum albumin and anthropometric indices Because individuals over 60 years of age tend to be more sedentary, a lower total energy intake of 30kcal to 35kcal per kg per day is acceptable.

Printed on: 09/05/19 Conclusion statement in support of this recommendation was given Grade II The ADA chronic kidney disease Expert Work Group concurs with the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines for Nutrition in Chronic Renal Failure The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) evidence analysis process began in 1995 and it has evolved since that time. ADA recommendations were graded when based on more recent Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines since they were developed using methods of evidence analysis that are comparable to the ADA evidence analysis process. Many Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines were supported by expert opinion and therefore were graded as Consensus by the ADA chronic kidney disease Expert Work Group. During the development of these guidelines, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) international evidence-based guidelines were also under development and will be incorporated into future revision of these guidelines. Please check the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative website (www. Kidney. org) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes website (www.

Hypophosphatemia is common post Kidney transplant. Rating: Consensus Conditional Risks/Harms of Implementing This Recommendation Hypophosphatemia and hyperphosphatemia are associated with increased morbidity and mortality Following initiation of vitamin D therapy, the use of cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol therapy should be coordinated with the serum calcium and phosphorus levels The RD should be aware of calciumand vitamin D-fortified foods and phosphorus-enhanced products The RD should be aware of the risks of hypercalcemia, such as soft tissue calcification, altered mental status, tetany, cardiac events and other adverse effects. Conditions of Application These recommendations apply to adults with chronic kidney disease (Stages Three to Five) and post Kidney transplant recipients exhibiting hypophosphatemia Current state laws and regulations which define the RDs scope of practice should be checked regarding interpretation of terms such as write an order, order changes, initiate, recommend, prescribe, etc. Nutrition prescription privileges may be granted to an RD by the governing body of the hospital or other practice settings. The governing body of the hospital or other practice settings via the medical staff bylaws may also designate an RD to receive and implement MDor DO-delegated orders or administer disease-specific or condition-specific patient care protocols, as approved and adopted by the facility or institution.

N. D), Evidence Analysis Library. Printed on: 09/05/19 Hyperphosphatemia and the associated conditions begin to appear as glomerular filtration rate declines below 60ml per minute. Hyperphosphatemia, elevated parathyroid hormone (parathyroid hormone), secondary hyperparathyroidism with depressed serum calcium and vitamin D deficiency are metabolic disturbances that require early detection and treatment to prevent bone disease of chronic hyperparathryoidism and to minimize the increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Evaluating, preventing and monitoring hyperparathyroidism requires data on serum calcium, serum phosphate and intact-parathyroid hormone. Treatment needs to be individualized and may include dietary phosphate restriction or phosphate binders and calcium and vitamin D supplementation and selfmanagement training. Dietary phosphorus intakes are correlated with dietary Protein intakes. Therefore, diets restricted in Protein are also lower in phosphorus (Delmez et al, 1992; Combe et al, 1995; Kates et al, 1997; Martinez et al, 1997; Cannata-Andia et al, 2000). From the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines for Bone Metabolism and Disease in Chronic Kidney Disease (2003) Guideline 4: Restriction of Dietary Phosphorus in Patients with chronic kidney disease 4. 1: Dietary phosphorus should be restricted to 800mg to 1, 000mg per day (adjusted for dietary Protein needs) when the serum phosphorus levels are elevated over 4. 6mg per dL (1. 49mmol per L) at Stages Three and Four of chronic kidney disease (Opinion) and over 5. 5mg per dL (1. 78mmol per L) in those with Kidney failure (Stage Five) (Evidence) 4. 2: Dietary phosphorus should be restricted to 800mg to 1, 000mg per day (adjusted to dietary Protein needs) when the plasma level of intact parathyroid hormone are elevated above target range of the chronic kidney disease stage (Evidence).",

Recommendation(s) chronic kidney disease: Vitamin D Supplementation In adults with chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease, including post Kidney transplant), the registered dietitian (RD) should recommend vitamin D supplementation to maintain adequate levels of vitamin D if the serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D is less than 30ng per ml (75nmol per L). chronic kidney disease patients have a predisposition for mineral and bone disorders, as well as other conditions that may be affected by insufficient vitamin D. Sufficient vitamin D should be recommended to maintain adequate levels of serum vitamin D. Rating: Consensus Conditional Risks/Harms of Implementing This Recommendation Following initiation of vitamin D therapy, the use of cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol therapy should be coordinated with the serum calcium and phosphorus levels The RD should be aware of calciumand vitamin D-fortified foods and phosphorus-enhanced products The RD should be aware of the risks of hypercalcemia, such as soft tissue calcification, altered mental status, tetany, cardiac events and other adverse effects. Conditions of Application These recommendations apply to individuals with chronic kidney disease, with serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D below 30ng per ml (75nmol per L). Potential Costs Associated with Application Although costs of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) sessions and reimbursement vary, MNT sessions are essential for improved outcomes.

Potential Costs Associated with Application Although costs of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) sessions and reimbursement vary, MNT sessions are essential for improved outcomes. Recommendation Narrative Anemia of chronic kidney disease is more prevalent at glomerular filtration rate below 60ml per minute as a consequence of loss of erythropoietin synthesis by the Kidney. Target goals for treatment are hemoglobin levels of 12g per dL for males and 11g per dL for females (Austrian Multicenter Study Group of r-HuEPO in Predialysis Patients, 1992). One randomized controlled trial in patients with chronic Kidney disease without Dialysis comparing erythropoietin treatment vs. placebo reported significant improvement in energy levels and work capacity in the treatment group (ultrasound Recombinant Human Erythropoietin Predialysis Study Group, 1991) Iron supplementation is necessary for effective erythropoiesis. When there is inadequate response to rHu-erythropoietin, folate and vitamin B12 status should also be evaluated (Jungers et al, 2001). There are limited long-term studies of the benefits of rHu-erythropoietin in chronic Kidney disease (non-Dialysis).

N. D), Evidence Analysis Library. Printed on: 09/05/19 CPR 3. 2: Using Iron Agents 3. 2. 3 (Targets of iron therapy): In the opinion of the work group, sufficient iron should be administered to generally maintain the following indices of iron status during erythropoiesis-stimulating agent treatment 3. 2. 3. 2 (ND-chronic kidney disease and peritoneal dialysis-chronic kidney disease): Serum ferritin over 100ng per ml and transferrin saturation over 20% 3. 2. 4 (Upper level of ferritin): In the opinion of the work group, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine administration of IV iron if serum ferritin level is greater than 500ng per ml. When ferritin level is greater than 500ng per ml, decisions regarding IV iron administration should weigh erythropoiesis-stimulating agent responsiveness, hemoglobin and transferrin saturation level and the patients clinical status. 3. 2. 5 (Route of administration) 3. 2. 5. 2: In the opinion of the work group, the route of iron administration can be either IV or oral in patients with ND-chronic kidney disease or peritoneal dialysis-chronic kidney disease.

CPR Four: Behavioral Self-Management in Diabetes and chronic kidney disease Behavioral self-management in patients with Diabetes and chronic kidney disease is particularly challenging because of the intensive nature of the Diabetes regimen. Education alone is not sufficient to promote and sustain healthy behavior change, particularly with such a complex regimen. 4. 1: Self-management strategies should be key components of a multi-faceted treatment plan with attention to multiple behaviors Monitoring and treatment of glycemia Blood Hypertension Nutrition Smoking cessation Copyright Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (A.

Recommendation(s) chronic kidney disease: Physical Activity If not contraindicated, the registered dietitian (RD) should encourage adults with chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease, including post Kidney transplant), to increase frequency or duration of physical activity as tolerated. Studies report that physical activity may minimize the catabolic effects of Protein restriction and improve quality of life. Rating: Fair Conditional Risks/Harms of Implementing This Recommendation Before beginning a program of physical activity more vigorous than brisk walking, individuals with chronic kidney disease should be assessed for conditions that might be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and other physical conditions that may be adversely affected Intense physical activity in adults with chronic kidney disease may contribute to disability or death, thus consultation with a physician prior to beginning an exercise program should be recommended Appropriate footwear is essential, especially for patients with neuropathy.

Recommendation Narrative Subsequent to the publication of the guideline reference below, terminology has been updated. From the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines for Nutrition in Chronic Renal Failure (2000) Copyright Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (A. N. D), Evidence Analysis Library. Printed on: 09/05/19 Guideline 26: Intensive Nutritional Counseling for Chronic Renal Failure (chronic renal failure) The nutritional status of individuals with chronic renal failure should be monitored at regular intervals (Evidence) A spontaneous reduction in dietary Protein intake (DPI) and a progressive decline in indices of nutritional status occur in many non-dialyzed patients with chronic renal failure The presence of Protein-energy malnutrition at the initiation of maintenance Dialysis is predictive of future mortality risk Interventions that maintain or improve nutritional status during progressive renal failure are likely to be associated with improved long-term survival after commencement of maintenance Dialysis Because evidence of Protein-energy malnutrition may develop before individuals require renal replacement therapy, regular monitoring (e. g. , at oneto threemonth intervals) of the patients nutritional status should be a routine component of the care for the patient with chronic renal failure Nutritional status should be assessed more frequently if there is inadequate nutrient intake, frank Protein-energy malnutrition or the presence of an illness that may worsen nutritional status. Appendix IV: Role of the Renal Dietitian Implicit in many of the guidelines in this document is the availability to the patient of an individual with expertise in renal dietetics Implementation of many of the guidelines concerning nutritional assessment (anthropometry, subjective global assessment, dietary interviews and diaries and integration of the results of nutritional measurements) and nutritional therapy (developing a plan for nutritional management, counseling the patient and his or her family on appropriate dietary Protein and energy intake, monitoring nutrient intake, educational activities and encouragement to maximize dietary compliance) is best performed by an individual who is trained and experienced in these tasks Although occasionally a physician, nurse or other individual may possess the expertise and time to conduct such activities, a registered dietitian, trained and experienced in renal nutrition, usually is best qualified to carry out these tasks. Recommendation Strength Rationale The ADA chronic kidney disease Expert Work Group concurs with the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines for Nutrition in Chronic Renal Failure. The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) evidence analysis process began in 1995 and it has evolved since that time. ADA recommendations were graded when based on more recent Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines since they were developed using methods of evidence analysis that are comparable to the ADA evidence analysis process. Many Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines were supported by expert opinion and therefore were graded as Consensus by the ADA chronic kidney disease Expert Work Group. During the development of these guidelines, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) international evidence-based guidelines were also under development and will be incorporated into future revision of these guidelines. Please check the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative website ( www. Kidney. org) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes website ( www. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes. org) for updates and new publications. Minority Opinions Consensus reached.

Recommendation(s) chronic kidney disease: Multivitamin Supplementation In adults with chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease, including postKidney transplant), with no known nutrient deficiency (biochemical or physical) and who may be at higher nutritional risk due to poor dietary intake and decreasing glomerular filtration rate, the registered dietitian (RD) should recommend or prescribe a multivitamin preparation. Sufficient vitamin supplementation should be recommended to maintain indices of adequate nutritional status. Rating: Consensus Conditional Risks/Harms of Implementing This Recommendation Intakes above 100% of the DRI for an individual may result in adverse effects The RD should be aware of fortified foods and nutrient-enhanced products If biochemical indices such as Potassium or phosphorus are elevated, multivitamin formulations with minimal or no levels of these nutrients should be recommended. Specific renal formulations may be considered. Sub-clinical nutrient deficiencies take years to manifest before they may become clinically evident. Conditions of Application This recommendation applies to adults with chronic kidney disease (including post-Kidney transplant), with no known nutrient deficiency (biochemical or physical) and who may be at higher nutritional risk due to poor dietary intake and decreasing glomerular filtration rate Current state laws and regulations which define the RDs scope of practice should be checked regarding interpretation of terms such as write an order, order changes, initiate, recommend, prescribe, etc. Nutrition prescription privileges may be granted to an RD by the governing body of the hospital or other practice settings. The governing body of the hospital or other practice settings, via the medical staff bylaws, may also designate an RD to receive and implement MDor DO-delegated orders or administer disease-specific or condition-specific patient care protocols, as approved and adopted by the facility or institution.

Guideline 8: Vitamin D Therapy in chronic kidney disease Patients Guideline 8A: Active Vitamin D Therapy in Patients with Stages Three and Four chronic kidney disease 8A. 1: In patients with chronic kidney disease Stages Three and Four, therapy with an active oral vitamin D sterol (calcitriol, alfacalcidol, or doxecalciferol) is indicated when serum levels of 25(OH)-vitamin D are more than 30ng per ml (75nmol per L) and plasma levels of intact parathyroid hormone are above the target range for the chronic kidney disease stage (Evidence) 8A. 1a: Treatment with an active vitamin D sterol should be undertaken only in patients with serum levels of corrected total calcium lower than 9. 5mg per dL (2. 37mmol per L) and serum phosphorus lower than 4. 6mg per dL (1. 49mmol per L) (Opinion) 8A. 1b: Vitamin D sterols should not be prescribed for patients with rapidly worsening Kidney function or those who are non-compliant with medications or follow-up (Opinion). 8A. 2: During therapy with vitamin D sterols, serum levels of calcium and phosphorus should be monitored at least every month after initiation of therapy for the first three months, then every month thereafter. Plasma parathyroid hormone levels should be measured at least every three months for six months and every three months thereafter (Opinion) 8A. 3 Dosage adjustments for patients receiving active vitamin D sterol therapy should be made as follows: 8A. 3a: If plasma levels of intact parathyroid hormone fall below the target range for the chronic kidney disease stage, hold active vitamin D sterol therapy until plasma levels of intact parathyroid hormone rise to above the target range, then resume treatment with the dose of active vitamin D sterol reduced by half. If the lowest daily dose of the active vitamin D sterol is being used, reduce to alternate-day dosing (Opinion). 8A. 3b: If serum levels of corrected total calcium exceed 9. 5mg per dL (2. 37mmol per L), hold active vitamin D sterol therapy until serum calcium returns to less than 9. 5mg per dL (2. 37mmol per L), then resume treatment at half the previous dose. If the lowest daily dose of the active vitamin D sterol is being used, reduce to alternate-day dosing (Opinion). 8A. 3c: If serum levels of phosphorus rise to more than 4. 6mg per dL (1. 49mmol per L), hold active vitamin D therapy, initiate or increase dose of phosphate binder until the levels of serum phosphorus fall to less than 4. 6mg per dL (1.",

To see more detail on the evidence from which the following recommendations were drawn, use the hyperlinks in the Supporting Evidence Section below. Recommendation(s) chronic kidney disease: Control Potassium Intake in chronic kidney disease For adults with chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease), including post Kidney transplant who exhibit hyperkalemia, the registered dietitian (RD) should recommend or prescribe a Potassium intake of less than 2. 4g (Stages Three to Five), with adjustments based on the following: Serum Potassium level Blood Hypertension Medications Kidney function Hydration status Acidosis Glycemic control Catabolism Gastrointestinal (GI) issues, including Vomiting, diarrhea, constipation and GI bleed. Dietary and other therapeutic lifestyle modifications are recommended as part of a comprehensive strategy to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in adults with chronic kidney disease. The degree of hypokalemia or hyperkalemia can have a direct effect on cardiac function, with potential for cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. Rating: Fair Conditional Risks/Harms of Implementing This Recommendation A nutrition prescription that is too High or too Low in Potassium may result in adverse outcomes The RD should use clinical judgment in applying a Potassium-controlled diet in patients exhibiting hyperkalemia or hypokalemia secondary to level of Kidney function, considering type of diuretic used, type of anithypertensive drug used or other drugs, supplements, food or non-food items, with potential to cause Potassium retention or Potassium loss. Conditions of Application Potassium intake recommendations apply to adults with chronic kidney disease in Stages Three to Five, including post Kidney transplant, who exhibit hyperkalemia Current state laws and regulations which define the RDs scope of practice should be checked regarding interpretation of terms such as write an order, order changes, initiate, recommend, prescribe, etc. Nutrition prescription privileges may be granted to an RD by the governing body of the hospital or other practice settings. The governing body of the hospital or other practice settings via the medical staff bylaws may also designate an RD to receive and implement MDOR DO-delegated orders or administer disease-specific or condition-specific patient care protocol(s), as approved and adopted by the facility or institution. For more information, members of the American Dietetic Association can access www. eatright. org/quality. Under Quality Management, topics include Practice Resources, Regulatory, State Resources, Licensure and Accreditation Organization. Potential Costs Associated with Application Although costs of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) sessions and reimbursement vary, MNT sessions are essential for improved outcomes. Recommendation Narrative The prevalence of hypertension and hyperlipidemia with risk for cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease and left ventricular hypertrophy is higher in chronic kidney disease, compared to the general population. Serum Potassium should be monitored because of the effect of some antihypertensive agents on Potassium excretion (Iseki et al, 1996; Bakris et al, 2000). From the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines on Hypertension and Antihypertensive Agents in Chronic Kidney Disease (2004) Guideline 6: Dietary and Other Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes in Adults Dietary and other therapeutic lifestyle modifications are recommended as part of a comprehensive strategy to lower Blood Hypertension and reduce cardiovascular disease risk in chronic kidney disease. 6. 2: Other dietary recommendations for adults should be modified according to the stage of chronic kidney disease (B) 6.",

To see more detail on the evidence from which the following recommendations were drawn, use the hyperlinks in the Supporting Evidence Section below. Recommendation(s) chronic kidney disease: Monitor and Evaluate Adherence to Nutrition and Lifestyle Recommendations The registered dietitian (RD) should monitor the following in adults with chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease, including post Kidney transplant): Copyright Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (A. N. D), Evidence Analysis Library. Printed on: 09/05/19 Food and nutrient intake (e. g. , diet history, diet experience and intake of macronutrients and micronutrients, such as energy, Protein, Sodium, Potassium, calcium, phosphorus and others, as appropriate) Medication (prescription and over-the-counter), dietary supplements (vitamin, minerals, Protein, etc. ), herbal or botanical supplement use Knowledge, beliefs or attitudes (e. g. , readiness to change nutrition and lifestyle behaviors) Behavior Factors affecting access to food and foodand nutrition-related supplies (e. g. , safe food and meal availability). Monitoring and evaluation of the above factors is needed to determine the effectiveness of Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) in adults with chronic kidney disease and post Kidney transplant. Rating: Consensus Imperative Risks/Harms of Implementing This Recommendation None. Conditions of Application No conditions specified. Potential Costs Associated with Application Although costs of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) sessions and reimbursement vary, MNT sessions are essential for improved outcomes. Recommendation Narrative Subsequent to the publication of the guideline reference below, terminology has been updated. From the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines for Nutrition in Chronic Renal Failure (2000) Guideline 23: Panels of Nutrition Measures for Non-Dialyzed Patients For individuals with chronic renal failure (glomerular filtration rate under 20ml per minute), Protein-energy nutritional status should be evaluated by serial measurements of a panel of markers, including at least one value from each of the following clusters: 1. Serum albumin 2. Edema-free actual body weight, percentage standard (NHANES II) body weight or subjective global assessment (SGA) 3. Normalized Protein nitrogen appearance (nPNA) or dietary interviews and diaries (evidence and opinion). Appendix III: Dietary Interviews and Diaries There are several methods for estimating dietary nutrient intake. The most common methods are food intake records and dietary recalls. The dietary recall (usually obtained for the previous 24 hours) is a simple, rapid method of obtaining a crude assessment of dietary intake. It can be performed in approximately 30 minutes, does not require the patient to keep records and relies on the patients ability to remember how much food was eaten during the previous 24 hours. Accurate quantification of the amounts of foods eaten is critical for the 24-hour recall. Various models of foods and measuring devices are used to estimate portion sizes. Advantages to the recall method are that respondents usually will not be able to modify their eating behavior in anticipation of a dietary evaluation and they do not have to be literate.",

    "text": "Disadvantages of the 24-hour recall include its reliance on memory (which may be particularly limiting in the elderly), that the responses may be less accurate or unrepresentative of typical intakes and that it must be obtained by a trained and skilled dietitian. Dietary diaries are written reports of foods eaten during a specified length of time. A food-intake record, lasting for several (three to seven) days, provides a more reliable estimate of an individuals nutrient intake than do single-day records. Records kept for more than three days increase the likelihood of inaccurate reporting because an individuals motivation has been shown to decrease with increasing number of days of dietary data collection, especially if the days are consecutive. On the other hand, records maintained for shorter times may not provide accurate data on usual food and nutrient intakes. The actual number of days chosen to collect food records should depend on the degree of accuracy needed, the day-to-day variability in the intake of the nutrient being measured and the cooperation of the patient. The validity and reliability of the dietary interviews and diaries depend on the patients ability to provide accurate data and the ability of the nutritionist to conduct detailed, probing interviews. The intake of nutrients is generally calculated using computer-based programs. Food records must be maintained meticulously to maximize the accuracy of the diary. Food intake should be recorded at the time the food is eaten to minimize reliance on memory. Special data collection forms and instructions are provided to assist the individual to record adequate detail. Recording error can be minimized if instructions and proper directions on how to approximate portion sizes and servings of fluid are provided. Food models are also helpful for instruction. The food record should indicate the time of day of any intake (both meals and snacks), the names of foods eaten, the approximate amount ingested, the method of preparation and special recipes or steps taken in the food preparation. The dietitian should carefully review the food record with the patient for accuracy and completeness shortly after it is completed. Recommendation Strength Rationale The ADA chronic kidney disease Expert Work Group concurs with the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines for Nutrition in Chronic Renal Failure The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) evidence analysis process began in 1995 and it has evolved since that time. ADA recommendations were graded when based on more recent Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines since they were developed using methods of evidence analysis that are comparable to the ADA evidence analysis process. Many Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines were supported by expert opinion and therefore were graded as Consensus by the ADA chronic kidney disease Expert Work Group. During the development of these guidelines, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) international evidence-based guidelines were also under development and will be incorporated into future revision of these guidelines Please check the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative website ( www. Kidney. org) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes website ( www. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes. org) for updates and new publications. Minority Opinions Consensus reached. Supporting Evidence The recommendations were created from the evidence analysis on the following questions.
