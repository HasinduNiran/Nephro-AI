Laboratory medicine plays a crucial role in both diagnosing and managing chronic kidney disease, as diagnosis and staging rely on estimated glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate) and evaluating albuminuria (or proteinuria). It was evident that the laboratory assessment of chronic kidney disease in Malaysia is not standardised. In light of this, the Malaysian Association of Clinical Biochemistry chronic kidney disease (MACB-chronic kidney disease) Task Force issued a national recommendation for laboratory diagnosis of chronic kidney disease in 2019. Recently, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) updated its recommendations for the diagnosis, evaluation, management, and treatment of chronic kidney disease. These guidelines incorporate the most recent evidence-based practices to support laboratory professionals in delivering optimal care for individuals with chronic kidney disease, focusing on critical areas such as estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate), albuminuria assessment, and risk stratification. The latest National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on chronic kidney disease has also incorporated the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) as a tool for predicting the likelihood of progression to end-stage Kidney disease (end-stage kidney disease) in chronic kidney disease patients. Hence, the MACB-chronic kidney disease Task Force has reviewed and updated its recommendations for laboratory reporting of estimated glomerular filtration rate and Urine albumin in alignment with the latest guidelines.
