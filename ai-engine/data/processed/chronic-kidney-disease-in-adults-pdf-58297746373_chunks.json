Quality measures The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured, and can be adapted and used flexibly. Structure a) Evidence of the availability of atorvastatin 20 magnesium within local service providers. Data source: Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare professionals and provider organisations, for example, from local formularies. b) Evidence of local systems to check whether adults with chronic kidney disease are taking atorvastatin 20 magnesium and invite them to discuss starting treatment if not.

Subject to Notice of rights ( conditionsnotice-of-rights). 23 Chronic Kidney disease in adults (QS5) Data source: Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare professionals and provider organisations, for example, from local protocols and service specifications. Process Proportion of adults with chronic kidney disease who receive atorvastatin 20 magnesium. Numerator the number in the denominator who receive atorvastatin 20 magnesium. Denominator the number of adults with chronic kidney disease. Data source: Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare professionals and provider organisations, for example, from audit of health records. cardiovascular disease Prevents indicator CVDP010CHOL reports the percentage of patients aged 18 and over with GP-recorded chronic kidney disease (G3a to G5), who are currently having treatment with lipid-lowering therapy. This measures lipid-lowering therapies and is not specific to a statin. Outcomes a) Prevalence of cardiovascular disease among people with chronic kidney disease. Data source: No routinely collected national data for this measure has been identified. Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare professionals and provider organisations, for example, from audit of health records. b) Incidence of cardiovascular events for people with chronic kidney disease.

Data source: Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare professionals and provider organisations, for example, from audit of health records. d) Proportion of people with chronic kidney disease on a statin without a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease with a greater than 40% reduction in non-High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.

Numerator the number in the denominator who have an LDL cholesterol level of 2. 0 mmol per litre or less, or non-HDL cholesterol level of 2. 6 mmol per litre or less.

    "text": "What the quality statement means for different audiences Service providers (such as general practices and secondary care services, including renal, cardiology, Diabetes and rheumatology clinics) ensure that systems are in place for adults with chronic kidney disease to be offered atorvastatin 20 magnesium. For example, this may be done through incorporating treatment algorithms into software applications to provide users with patient-specific recommendations on treatment. Healthcare professionals (such as GPs, nephrologists, cardiologists, diabetologists, rheumatologists, nurses and pharmacists) check whether adults with chronic kidney disease are taking a statin, and discuss the risks and benefits of starting statin therapy if not. They offer atorvastatin 20 magnesium and increase the dose if an adequate response to treatment is not achieved and estimated glomerular filtration rate is 30 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 or more. If a person is not able to tolerate atorvastatin 20 magnesium or reports adverse effects, they discuss alternative options such as stopping the statin or changing the dose or type of statin. NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights ( conditionsnotice-of-rights). 23 Chronic Kidney disease in adults (QS5) Commissioners ensure that they commission services in which adults with chronic kidney disease are offered atorvastatin 20 magnesium. Commissioners may do this by seeking evidence of practice through clinical audits. Adults with chronic kidney disease are at a higher risk of Heart attacks and strokes. To help reduce the risk they are offered a type of medicine called a statin, which lowers the level of cholesterol (sometimes called lipids) in the Blood. If their cholesterol level does not decrease enough, they may change to a higher dose. If the statin causes any side effects, their doctor might ask them to stop taking it for a while to check that they are caused by the statin. Their doctor might discuss reducing the dose or changing to a different statin. Source guidance Chronic Kidney disease: assessment and management.

The 2011 quality standard for chronic kidney disease is available as a pdf. Minor changes since publication December 2023: Changes have been made to the source guidance and outcome measures sections for statement 3 to align them with the updated NICE guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification. A definition of adults with chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease has been added to statement 3. Data sources have been reviewed throughout and updated for statement 1. May 2023: Recommendation numbers have been amended in statement 3 to align them with the updated NICE guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification. Hyperlinks, data sources and audience descriptors have been reviewed throughout and updated as needed. August 2021: Recommendation numbers, references and links to source guidance have been updated throughout and definitions in statement 1 have been amended to align with the updated NICE guideline on chronic Kidney disease. NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights ( conditionsnotice-of-rights). 23 Chronic Kidney disease in adults (QS5) About this quality standard NICE quality standards describe High-priority areas for quality improvement in a defined care or service area. Each standard consists of a prioritised set of specific, concise and measurable statements. NICE quality standards draw on existing NICE or NICE-accredited guidance that provides an underpinning, comprehensive set of recommendations, and are designed to support the measurement of improvement. Expected levels of achievement for quality measures are not specified. Quality standards are intended to drive up the quality of care, and so achievement levels of 100% should be aspired to (or 0% if the quality statement states that something should not be done). However, this may not always be appropriate in practice. Taking account of safety, shared decision making, choice, and professional judgement, desired levels of achievement should be defined locally. Information about how NICE quality standards are developed is available from the NICE website. See our webpage on quality standards advisory committees for details about our standing committees. Information about the topic experts invited to join the standing members is available from the webpage for this quality standard. NICE has produced a quality standard service improvement template to help providers make an initial assessment of their service compared with a selection of quality statements. This tool is updated monthly to include new quality standards. NICE guidance and quality standards apply in England and Wales. Decisions on how they apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland are made by the Scottish government and Northern Ireland Executive. NICE quality standards may include references to organisations or people responsible for commissioning or providing care that may be relevant only to England. Resource impact NICE quality standards should be achievable by local services. The potential resource impact is considered by the quality standards advisory committee, drawing on resource NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights ( conditionsnotice-of-rights). 23 Chronic Kidney disease in adults (QS5) impact work for the source guidance. Organisations are encouraged to use the resource impact summary report for NICEs guideline on chronic Kidney disease and the resource impact products for NICEs guideline on cardiovascular disease to help estimate local costs.",
