ABSTRACT ARTICLE DETAILS Renal failure is the most important disease that causes losing in the efficiency of Kidney and is renal Published On: failure or may called end stage Kidney disease where capacity for Kidney become 15% less than the 18 August 2023 normal levels. This disease can be classified into two types: first (acute Kidney failure ) which may resolve and it rapidly developed. Second (chronic Kidney failure): it slowly developed and may become a permanent condition Symptoms of Renal failure include Vomiting; Edema in the legs; a loss of appetite; confusion and tiredness. Several complications occurred which include High Blood Potassium; volume overload and uremia in acute condition while Hypertension; anemia and Heart disease in the chronic condition. There are several factors that may lead to the progress of acute renal failure conditions such as hypotension, a blockage of the urinary tract, hemolytic uremic syndrome and some medications. While Diabetes, hypertension, polycystic renal disease and nephrotic syndrome represent the major causes of chronic renal failure. Signs that help in identification of acute and chronic renal failure based on mishmash of several factors and help in distinguish between its types such as increasing of Creatinine levels and decreasing of Urine production are the signs of acute failure while decrease the rate of glomerular filtration to below of 15 or therapy with renal replacement are the signs of chronic renal failure. Acute failure can be treated depending on the main causes, on the other hand may use Dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal Dialysis) or Kidney transplant in order treating chronic failure. Available on: KEYWORDS: renal failure, acute renal failure, chronic renal failure INTRODUCTION used instead of Acute Renal Failure because it is more Kidney is a vital organ in the human body which removes comprehensive. (6) Several risk factors are responsible related waste products from circulation such as nitrogenous waste to progress of acute renal failure such as anemia, and exogenous molecules, such as drugs, in addition to hypertension, infectious disease (such as malaria) regulation levels of electrolytes, participated in the synthesis, chemotherapy and sepsis. This condition represented as of erythropoietin hormone and Metabolism of proteins that lethal condition and it is more prevalent in older aged while are Low molecular weight, such as insulin. (1) according to gender it is more prevalent in men than in The incapability of the Kidney to achieve its excretion women. (7) function leads to the preservation of nitrogenous waste 2. Chronic Renal Failure (chronic renal failure): products from the circulation and this is represented as renal This kind corresponds to the advancing defeat of Kidney failure.

Approximately 35% of cases produce from extended prerenal There is a negative charge found in the glomerular failure which brings about an episode of Acute tubule filtration membrane which acts as an obstruction that inhibits necrosis.

It is thought that these toxins were stages of the renal disease where in the United States there initiated by the collapse of skeletal muscles such as were annually infected 100000 of people.

This type of renal failure may improve but the patient Kidney disease is more increased with Population growth needs support and treatment to acquire its normal function where the Dialysis patients were more than million and they may still be in danger of initiation of Kidney failure worldwide and annually it is reach to a quarter of a million in in the future(15). the United States (23). For Chronic Renal Failure the main causes are Diabetes The percentage of chronic Kidney disease elevated from mellitus type2 and Hypertension first common cause.
