Sarafidis; E-mail: psarafidis11yahoo. gr ABSTRACT Until recently, major bodies producing guidelines for the management of hypertension in patients with chronic Kidney disease( chronic kidney disease) disagreed in some key issues. In June 2023, the European Society of Hypertension( ESH) published the new 2023 ESH Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension a document that was endorsed by the European Renal Association. Several novel recommendations relevant to the management of hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease appeared in these guidelines, which have been updated to reflect the latest evidence-based practices in managing hypertension in chronic kidney disease patients. Most of these are in general agreement with the previous 2021 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes( Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelinessome reflect different emphasis on some topics( i. e. detailed algorithms on antihypertensive agent use) while others reflect evolution of important evidence in recent years. The aim of the present review is to summarize and comment on key points and main areas of focus in patients with chronic kidney disease, as well as to compare and highlight the main differences with the 2021 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Guidelines for the management of Blood Hypertension in chronic kidney disease.

Thus, High blood pressure is by far the most common modifiable viduals with chronic kidney disease; its prevalence progressively increases with factor for chronic kidney disease progression.

    "text": "As previously discussed, this recommendation, based on Systolic Blood Hypertension Intervention Trial( SPRINT) results, was much different from any other relevant recommendation in major guideline documents 29, 30 . The 2023 ESH Guidelines provide a detailed discussion on the issue of most protective blood pressure targets in patients with chronic kidney disease, recognizing that for more than a decade, there has been considerable debate in the scientific literature in this field 14 . Overall, as shown in Fig. 1, it is recommend that in all patients with chronic kidney disease the primary goal is to lower office SBP to 140 mmHg and DBP 90 mmHg( CoR I, LoE A) and that in most chronic kidney disease patients ( young patients, patients with a Urine albumin-creatinine ratio ≥300 magnesium/g, High CV risk patients) office blood pressure may be lowered to 130/80 mmHg, if tolerated(C oR II, LoE B). Current evidence in the field derives from a few studies ( Table 3 ); proper randomized controlled tials(R CTs) comparing different blood pressure targets( i. e. SBP 140 vs 130 mmHg) in chronic kidney disease population with different Kidney function and albuminuria levels, achieving corresponding blood pressure levels during follow-up and being powered to investigate hard outcomes are still missing. In the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease( MDRD) study, the two arms ( Low and usual blood pressure target) showed similar projected glomerular filtration rate decline in 3 years, as well as risk of end-stage kidney disease and death 31 ; secondary analyses showed that patients with proteinuria 1 g/24 h in the Low-target group had decrease in proteinuria levels and slower glomerular filtration rate decline over time than patients in the usual-target group 32 . Similarly, in the African American Study on Kidney Disease ( AASK) no difference in outcomes between blood pressure target groups was observed in the overall population 33 ; however, in a post hoc analysis, Low blood pressure was again associated with better Kidney outcomes in patients with proteinuria 1 g/24 h 34 . A subsequent analysis that combined trial and cohort periods of both these studies, showed that Low target blood pressure was associated with lower risk for end-stage kidney disease and mortality in the total population; and this effect was mainly driven by changes in patients with Urine protein: Creatinine ratio 0. 44 g/g ( Urine albumin-creatinine ratio roughly 200 magnesium/g) 35 . The SPRINT randomized 9361 non-diabetic, hypertensive patients to intensive or standard treatment ( target SBP 120 vs 140 mmHg, respectively) 36 . From the total population, 28% had chronic kidney disease( estimated glomerular filtration rate 2060 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 ), but very few had albuminuria A2 or A3, as individuals with proteinuria 1 g/24 h or 1 g/g were excluded. In the overall trial, the primary composite CV endpoint, CV and total mortality were significantly lower in the intensive than in the standard-treatment group, but kidney outcomes did not differ between groups. In a sub-analysis of the SPRINT in patients with chronic kidney disease 37 , in whom achieved blood pressure was 123. 3 ± 0. 4/66. 9 ± 0. 3 mmHg in the intensive group ( vs 136. 9 ±0. 4/73. 8 ±0. 3 mmHg in the standard group), no difference between groups in the primary outcome nor in the prespecified Kidney outcome were detected, but mortality rate was lower in the intensive blood pressure arm.",
