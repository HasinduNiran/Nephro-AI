    "text": "How common is chronic Kidney disease? V In 201112: an estimated 11% of people (1. 7 million Australians) aged 18 and over had biomedical signs of chronic kidney disease, according to Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) analysis of the AustraIlian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) latest National Health Measures Survey (NHMS) (ABS 2013) H the prevalence of chronic kidney disease increased rapidly with age, aecting around 44% of people aged 75 and over (AIHW 2018) only 6. 1 of NHMS respondents who showed biomedical signs of chronic kidney disease self-reported having the disease, indicating that chronic kidney disease is a largely under-diagnosed condition (ABS 2013). For more information on the incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease, see How many people are living with chronic Kidney disease in C Australia? Change over time Two national surveys have been conducted in Australia that provide data on biomarkers of chronic kidney disease the 19992000 Australian Diabetes, R Obesity and Lifestyle Study - external site opens in new window (AusDiab) and the 201112 NHMS. Between 19992000 and 201112: the age-standardisedCKD prevalence rate remained stable thAe number of Australians with moderate to severe loss of Kidney function nearly doubled, from 322, 000 to 604, 000. This increase was mostly driven by growth in the population of older people (as people live longer) and by survival of people with Kidney failure who are receiving KRT (AIHW 2018). The ABS is currently undertaking a multi-year Intergenerational Health and Mental Health Study in 20212024 - external site opens in new window, which will include a new NHMS and a new National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Measures Survey (ABS 2022). For more information, see Trends over time. Kidney failure Not everyone with Kidney failure chooses to receive KRT, opting instead for end-of-life care. Therefore, prevalence estimates for Kidney failure need to count cases both with and without replacement therapy. The most recent data available to examine this are linked data from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) Registry and the National Death Index, covering the period 1997 to 2013 (AIHW 2016). In 2013: there were around 5, 100 new cases of Kidney failure in Australia around 14 new cases per day of these, half (50%) were receiving KRT 92% of people with newly diagnosed Kidney failure who were aged under 55 received KRT, compared with 19% of people newly diagnosed aged 75 and over. Before age 75, most new cases of Kidney failure are treated with KRT; however, this trend reverses after age 75, with an 11-fold increase in Kidney failure without KRT compared with those aged 6574 (145 and 13 per 100, 000 population) (Figure 1) (AIHW 2016). Figure 1: Incidence of Kidney failure with and without replacement therapy, by age, 2013 The bar chart shows the incidence rate of Kidney failure in 2013 by sex, age group and Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) treatment status, from the AIHW analysis of the linked ANZDATA, AIHW National Mortality Database and National Death Index. The treatment rate for new patients with Kidney failure increased slightly with age from 4. 8 per 100, 000 population among persons aged under 55, to 35 per 100, 000 population among persons aged 75 and over. In contrast, the rate of new patients with Kidney failure D who did not get any KRT treatment increased sharply from 0. 4 per 100, 000 population among those aged under 55 to 145 per 100, 000 population among those aged 75 and over. These age patterns are similar for men and women, with higher Kidney failure incidence rates observed for males.",

E V I H C R A Download data Impact of chronic Kidney disease Burden of chronic Kidney disease Burden of disease refers to the quantied impact of living with and dying prematurely from a disease or injury. In 2023, chronic kidney disease was: responsible for 1. 1% of the total burden (fatal and non-fatal), compared with 0. 8% in 2003 the 14th leading cause of fatal burden across all age groups the sixth leading cause of fatal burden for women aged 8589 and ninth leading cause of fatal burden for men aged 8589 (AIHW 2023). For more information on the burden of chronic kidney disease, see Burden of chronic Kidney disease. Deaths from chronic Kidney disease chronic kidney disease contributed to around 22, 000 deaths in 2022 (11% of all deaths in Australia), a rate of 84 per 100, 000 population. chronic kidney disease was recorded as the underlying cause of death in 22% and associated cause of death in 78% of chronic kidney disease deaths. The number of chronic kidney disease-related deaths has more than doubled since 2000 (when there were 10, 200 deaths). chronic kidney disease mortality rates increased slightly year-on-year in both 2021 and 2022 (4. 2% and 6. 2%, respectively), after adjusting for age (Figure 2). These increases should be interpreted in the context of higher overall mortality in 2022, with two-thirds of excess deaths being associated with COVID-19 (ABS 2023b). People with pre-existing chronic conditions are also at higher risk of more severe outcomes from COVID-19 with chronic Kidney diseases being a pre-existing condition among 13. 2% of people who died from the virus (registered to 28 February 2023) (ABS 2023a). D For more information on deaths from chronic kidney disease, see Mortality. Figure 2: Trends in chronic Kidney disease death rates (underlying or associated cause), by sex, 2000 to 2022 This graph shows the age-standardised rate of deaths where chronic kidney disease was recorded as either an underlying or associated cause of death, from 2000 to 2021. Rates are higher in males than in females and have remained reElatively stable. For persons, the rate of chronic kidney disease deaths per 100, 000 population was 55 in 2000, and 57 in 2021. The highest rate was in 2008, with 61 deaths per 100, 000 population. V I H C R A Download data Treatment and management of chronic Kidney disease Hospitalisations chronic kidney disease was recorded as the principal or additional diagnosis for around 2 million hospitalisations 18% of all hospitalisations in Australia in 202122. Dialysis was the most common reason for hospitalisation, accounting for 14% of all hospitalisations, and 81% of chronic kidney disease hospitalisations (1. 7 million). There were 385, 000 hospitalisations with a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (excluding Dialysis as a principal diagnosis). Of these, 85% had chronic kidney disease as an additional (rather than principal) diagnosis. Between 200001 and 202122: the number of hospitalisations with chronic kidney disease as the principal diagnosis (excluding Dialysis) more than doubled, from 24, 200 to 56, 800 the age-standardised hospitalisation rate for chronic kidney disease as a principal diagnosis rose by 57%. For more information, see Hospitalisations for chronic Kidney disease. Kidney replacement therapy In 2022, around 29, 000 people received KRT with 53% being treated with Dialysis while 47% were living with a functioning Kidney transplant.

Generally, the impact of chronic kidney disease in terms of prevalence, hospitalisation, mortality and burden of disease, is greater among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (First Nations) people, people living in lower socioeconomic areas, and people living in Remote and very remote areas. For example: V An estimated 59, 600 First Nations adults (18%) had biomedical signs of chronic kidney disease in 201213 (ABS 2014). First Nations adults were 2. 1 times as likely as non-Indigenous adults to have biomedical signs of chronic kidney disease, after adjusting for age. chronic kidney disease accounted for 2. 5% of total disease burden among First Nations people in 2018 (6, 500 DALY). The proportion attributed to fatal I burden (73%) was higher than non-fatal burden (27%). The burden from chronic kidney disease was 7. 8 times as High among First Nations people as non-Indigenous people (AIHW 2021, 2022). H Among people living in the lowest socioeconomic areas, there were around 16, 200 deaths where chronic kidney disease was the underlying or associated cause in 20202022 (105 per 100, 000 population). The chronic kidney disease death rate among this group was 1. 8 times as High as for people living in the highest socioeconomic areas, after adjusting for age. Among people living in Remote and very remote areas, there were 17, 100 chronic kidney disease hospitalisations in 202122 (3, 400 per 100, 000 population). People living in theCse areas were 3. 0 times as likely to be hospitalised for chronic kidney disease as people living in Major cities, after adjusting for age. Where do I go for more information?

D Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2024 E V I H C R A Introduction Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) refers to abnormalities of Kidney structure or function, that are present for 3 months or more. It may be caused by several conditions such as Diabetes, Hypertension or congenital conditions. Identifying the underlying cause of chronic kidney disease is integral to its treatment and management. The kidneys essentially clean the Blood by ltering it through millions of tiny functional units callDed nephrons (Lote 2012). When the kidneys are healthy, they lter about half a cup of Blood each minute and produce around 1. 5 litres of Urine a day. Urine contains waste products and toxins, which the kidneys remove from the Blood. The kidneys also help to maintain a proper balance of salts and minerals in the body, regulate Blood Hypertension, absorb glucose and activate vitamin D. chronic kidney disease is a common and costly disease; however, it is largely preventable as a numbeEr of its key risk factors are modiable. The number of people with chronic kidney disease in Australia is increasing (AIHW 2018), and prevalence rates are likely vastly underestimated (ABS 2013). Because the kidneys can continue to work even when they are damaged, most people do not realise they have chronic kidney disease until the disease has progressed far enough for symptoms to develop. V Kidney failure describes the point at which a Kidney transplant or Dialysis is required for a person to survive. Clinically, it is dened by an estimated glomerular ltration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate) of less than 15 milliliters per minute/1. 73m2, or being on Dialysis. Treatment and management of Kidney failure place a signicant burden on the person, their carers, families and friends and the health system. I Fortunately, simple tests performed by a general practitioner can identify most cases of chronic kidney disease when the disease is in its early stages, enabling treatment to prevent or slow progressioHn and reduce the likelihood of developing Kidney failure. In 2020, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) released new guidelines for nomenclature (naming) related to Kidney function and disease (Levey et al. 2020). This report uses updated terminology based on these guidelines. What is Kidney disease? C Kidney disease can be acute (lasting less than 3 months) or chronic (lasting 3 months or more). Chronic Kidney disease R Clinically, chronic Kidney disease is dened as one of the following being present for 3 months or more: estimated or measured glomerular ltration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate/glomerular filtration rate) of less than 60mL/min/1. 73m2, with or without evidence of Kidney damage. Kidney damage with or without decreased glomerular filtration rate, indicated by any of the following: A 1. albuminuria a condition caused when the kidneys cannot lter large Protein molecules out of the Blood, so they pass into the Urine 2. haematuria the presence of Blood in the Urine, not caused by another condition 3. structural abnormalities, for example abnormally small kidneys 4. pathological abnormalities, for example interstitial nephritis (inammation of part of the kidneys). Chronic Kidney disease is classied into 5 stages, depending on the level of Kidney function. Stages 1 and 2 estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 60, with albuminuria, haematuria, or a pathological or structural abnormality There are usually no symptoms, as the kidneys are still able to function adequately when they are slightly damaged.",

The risk of disease progression depends on albuminuria levels. Stages 3 and 4 estimated glomerular filtration rate between 15 and 59, with or without albuminuria The level of waste (urea and Creatinine) in the Blood rises and a person may start to feel unwell. Kidney function is reduced and Blood Hypertension rises. This is usually when diagnosis occurs. Stage 3 is marked by a moderate reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (between 30 and 59 milliliters per minute/m2) and is divided into stage 3a and 3b. Stage 4 is marked by a severe reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (between 15 and 29 milliliters per minute/m2). In these stages, the risk of progression can depend on both glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria stages. Stage 5 Kidney failure (also known as end-stage Kidney disease) estimated glomerular filtration rate 15 or on Dialysis D This is marked by substantial loss of Kidney function. The kidneys are no longer able to adequately lter waste from the Blood and the person requires Kidney replacement therapy either Dialysis or a Kidney transplant to stay alive. The risk of progression is very High. Acute Kidney injury E Acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) refers to a sudden decline in glomerular filtration rate due to a rapid increase in serum Creatinine or oliguria (a decrease in Urine output) or both (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes acute kidney injury Work Group 2012). It has multiple causes, including illness, medications, and injuries to the Kidney. Following acute kidney injury, Kidney function often returns to normal within 3 months. V Source: KHA 2020a, b, c.

D E V Ina is an Aboriginal woman and artist from Central Australia. After living with Diabetes for 20 years, she was diagnosed with Kidney failure and told she would need to have Dialysis. The diagnosis was a surprise to her and at rst, she didnt know what Dialysis was. She I was nervous about the treatment and had to move to Adelaide to access it. Leaving her country, family and community was dHicult and at rst Ina was homesick. When the sun went down, I was sitting outside and thinking about home. Up in the land at night-time, we always sat outside and watched the stars, beautiful stars. And I miss the stars. C Although she was worried initially, Ina has friends in Adelaide now and is happy, but says her home is still up North. She travels back sometimes and has used mobile Dialysis services to receive treatment while she visits home. Ina has also developed ways to manage her treatment and take care of herself. She makes sure to cook dinner to refrigerate before she goes to Dialysis, so she doesnt need to worry about preparing a meal when she gets home. R But she says the most dicult thing about living with Kidney disease is how hard it is on Aboriginal people from remote regions to move far away from home to receive treatment. Its very important and pretty dicult to manage. Some of ultrasound, some of our families, lose ultrasound on this machine.

It was important to her to talk with doctors about her journey and contribute to the new guidelines for treatment and management of chronic kidney disease in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

Trends over time E The prevalence of chronic Kidney disease remained stable between 19992000 and 201112. Variation between population groups An estimated 18% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adultsV (59, 600 people) had biomedical signs of chronic Kidney disease in ABS 201213. Further information Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) is a growing health problem in AusItralia. Due to our ageing population, its prevalence the total number of cases is likely to continue increasing. This web page presents data on prevalence of chronic kidney disease. H Due to the asymptomatic nature of chronic kidney disease, and because diagnosis requires the presence of measured biomedical markers that persist for at least 3 months, people often do not realise they have the disease. As a result, numbers based on self-report are often underestimates of the true number of people living with chronic kidney disease in Australia. Accurate estimates of the prevalence of chronic kidney disease require largescale surveys of biomedical markers of Kidney function in the population. C The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 201112 National Health Measures Survey (NHMS) is the most recent national survey to date to include biomedical testing for markers of chronic kidney disease (ABS 2013). The following section reports on the number of Australians who showed biomedical signs of chronic kidney disease in the 201112 NHMS; these data should not be compared with numbers reecting self-reported chronic kidney disease. R An estimated 1. 7 million Australians aged 18 and over had biomedical signs of chronic Kidney disease in 201112, representing 11% of the adult population, according to the most recently available data (AIHW analysis of ABS 2013). Only 6. 1% of adults with biomedical markers of chronic kidney disease self-reported having the condition in 201112, indicating that the majority of chronic kidney disease in AusAtralia is undiagnosed (ABS 2013). Variation by age and sex In 201112, the prevalence of biomedical signs of chronic kidney disease among adults aged 18 and over: was around 11% for both men and women (AIHW analysis of ABS 2013) increased rapidly after age 74, with rates among those aged 75 and over being twice as High (44%) as rates for people aged 6574 (22%) (Figure 1). Figure 1: Prevalence of chronic Kidney disease among people aged 18 and over, by age and sex, 201112 The bar chart shows the percentage of adults aged 18 and over who showed biomedical signs of chronic kidney disease in the 2011-12 National Health Measures Survey. Males had a higher prevalence than females across all age groups except 18 to 44 year-olds, where chronic kidney disease was slightly more prevalence in females (7. 1%) than males (5. 3%). Prevalence increased with age, and rapidly after age 65. People aged 75 and over showed the highest prevalence of biomedical signs of chronic kidney disease. D E V I H Download data Stages of chronic Kidney disease C Stages 1 and 2 estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 60, with albuminuria, haematuria, or a pathological or structural abnormality There are usually no symptoms, as the kidneys are still able to function adequately when they are slightly damaged.

Stages 3 and 4 estimated glomerular filtration rate between 15 and 59, with or without albuminuria A The level of waste (urea and Creatinine) in the Blood rises and a person may start to feel unwell. Kidney function is reduced and Blood Hypertension rises. This is usually when diagnosis occurs. Stage 3 is marked by a moderate reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (between 30 and 59 milliliters per minute/m2) and is divided into stage 3a and 3b. Stage 4 is marked by a severe reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (between 15 and 29 milliliters per minute/m2). In these stages, the risk of progression can depend on both glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria. Stage 5 Kidney failure (also known as end-stage Kidney disease) estimated glomerular filtration rate 15 or on Dialysis This is marked by substantial loss of Kidney function. The kidneys are no longer able to adequately lter waste from the Blood and the person requires Kidney replacement therapy either Dialysis or a Kidney transplant to stay alive. The risk of progression is very High. Figure 2: Stages of chronic Kidney disease and risk of progression, by glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria The table shows the categorisation of Kidney function stage according to glomerular ltration rate (glomerular filtration rate) and albuminuria stage. Albuminuria stage is categorised as normal, microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria according to Urine albumin-creatinine ratio (magnesium/mmol).

A Note that the ABS is currently undertaking a multi-year Intergenerational Health and Mental Health Study in 20202024, which will include a new NHMS and a new National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Measures Survey (ABS 2022). Between 19992000 and 201112, chronic kidney disease prevalence remained stable, at around 10% among adults aged 25 and over (AIHW 2018). There was no dierence between men and women in the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in both surveys (Figure 4). Figure 4: Prevalence of chronic Kidney disease among people aged 25 and over, by sex, 19992000 and 201112 The bar chart shows the percentage of adults aged 25 and over who showed biomedical signs of chronic kidney disease in two national surveys the AusDiab Study in 1999-2000 and the National Health Measures Survey in 2011-12, by sex. For both males and females, the proportion of the population with signs of chronic kidney disease remained stable between the 2 surveys, at around 10% of the population. Download data The age pattern between both surveys was similar, with chronic kidney disease prevalence increasing gradually until age 64, and sharply from age 65; however, there was a signicant increase in chronic kidney disease prevalence in those aged 2544 in 201112 compared with 19992000 (AIHW 2018) (Figure 5).

D Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2024 E V I H C R A Diabetes Diabetes is a chronic condition marked by High levels of glucose in the Blood. It is caused by the inability of the body to produce or eectively use insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas to control Blood glucose levels. Type 2 Diabetes is the most common form. It involves a genetic component but is largely preventable and can be managed with changes to diet and physical activity, and with medications (Diabetes Australia 2022). D Diabetes is one of the main causes of chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) (AIHW 2021, ANZDATA 2021). High Blood glucose levels can damage the Kidneys lters (nephrons), aecting the ability to remove waste and uid from the body. Diabetic Kidney disease is also called diabetic nephropathy. E Diabetes and chronic Kidney disease share risk factors. Many people with Diabetes develop Hypertension, which can also damage the kidneys. People with both chronic Kidney disease and Diabetes are more likely to develop other complications of Diabetes such as nerve damage and eye damage. Diabetes is the most common reason that people with chronic kidneVy disease need to have Dialysis or a Kidney transplant. The mortality risk for people with Kidney failure and Diabetes is greater than the risk for people with Kidney failure alone (Lim et al. 2018). In 2021, based on linked data from the National Diabetes ServicIes Scheme (NDSS) and Australasian Paediatric Endocrine Group (APEG) state-based registers: H more than 1 in 20 (1. 3 million) Australians were living with Diabetes. This includes people with type 1 Diabetes, type 2 Diabetes and other Diabetes, but excludes gestational Diabetes (AIHW 2023) Diabetes was more common in males (4. 8%) than females (3. 8%) after controlling for age almost 1 in 5 (19. 5%) Australians aged 8084 were living with Diabetes, which was almost 30 times as High as those aged under 40 (0. 7%) C age-standardised prevalence rose from 2. 4% in 2000 to 4. 3% in 2021. The Diabetes rate remained has remained relatively stable since 2011 (Figure 1). Information based on linked NDSS and APEG data underestimates prevalence as it does not include people with undiagnosed Diabetes. The ABS 2R01112 Australian Health Survey, which included both measured and self-reported data, showed that for every 4 adults with diagnosed Diabetes, there was 1 who was undiagnosed (ABS 2013). Figure 1: Prevalence of Diabetes from linked NDSS and APEG data, 2000 to 2021 This cAhart shows the estimated age-standardised proportion of people with Diabetes based on data from the linked National Diabetes Services Scheme and Australasian Paediatric Endocrine Group between 2000 and 2021.",

D E V I H Download data Data presented from the linked NDSS and APEG data (Figure 1) are likely to underestimate the true prevalence of Diabetes in the Australian population. This is beCcause: both data sources are based on people who have received a formal medical diagnosis of Diabetes. However, Australian studies have shown that many people are living with undiagnosed type 2 Diabetes. registration with the NDSS is voluntary and eligible people with type 2 Diabetes are more likely to register if they access subsidised diaRbetes consumables to monitor their Diabetes at home or require insulin. Some people may be diagnosed with Diabetes and choose not to register with the scheme. Indigenous Australians are under-represented on the NDSS (see Using the NDSS for reporting on Indigenous Australians). Despite these limitations, these data sources provide the best picture into the number of people living with Diabetes in Australia to monitor changes in populations at risk and trends over time. Further research is required to examine whether the proportion of A people with undiagnosed type 2 Diabetes in Australia has changed over time and the impact of this on the prevalence of disease in Australia. Variation between population groups Around 7. 9% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (64, 100 people) were living with Diabetes according to self-reported data from the ABS 201819 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey (ABS 2019). After controlling for dierences in the age structures of the populations, Indigenous Australians were almost 3 times as likely to have Diabetes as non-Indigenous Australians (13% compared with 4. 3%). The age-standardised prevalence rate of Diabetes in 2021 was around 1. 8 times as High among those living in the lowest socioeconomic areas as among those living in the highest socioeconomic areas. The variation in prevalence rates between the lowest and highest socioeconomic areas was slightly higher among females than males (2. 0 and 1. 7 times as High, respectively). The age-standardised prevalence rate of Diabetes in 2021 was highest in Remote and very remote areas where people were 1. 3 times as likely to be living with Diabetes as those in Major cities. The disparity in Remote and very remote areas was more pronounced among females than males (1. 6 and 1. 1 times as High, respectively) (AIHW 2023).

Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2024 V I H C R A Hypertension Blood Hypertension is the force exerted by Blood on the walls of the arteries, depending on whether the Heart muscle is contracting (systolic Blood Hypertension), or relaxing between contractions (diastolic Blood Hypertension). Hypertension, also known as raised Blood Hypertension or hypertension, is where Blood Hypertension is permanently higher than normal. D Untreated Hypertension is a key risk factor for the development and progression of chronic Kidney disease. It can damage the Blood vessels in the kidneys, leading to reduced Blood supply and making waste and uid removal dicult (Webster et al. 2017). Extra uid can, in turn, raise Blood Hypertension and cause more damage, ultimately leading to Kidney failure. Hypertension is also a risk factor for cardiovascular events in people with cEhronic Kidney disease or Kidney failure. Drug treatment and changes to health-related behaviours (such as weight loss, a healthy diet and physical activity) can help to control Blood Hypertension. In the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) National Health Survey 201718, people aged 18 years and over could consent to having a Blood Hypertension measurement taken at the time of the interview. UVncontrolled Hypertension is reported for participants with a systolic Blood Hypertension reading 140 mmHg or more, or diastolic Blood Hypertension of 90 mmHg or more, or receiving medication for Hypertension (ABS 2018). Blood Hypertension is considered to be uncontrolled if measured levels of systolic or diastolic Blood Hypertension are High, regardless of I the use of Blood Hypertension medication. Controlled Blood Hypertension refers to those people who are taking Blood Hypertension medication and have a normal Blood Hypertension reading. H In 201718, based on measured data from the National Health Survey: 34% of adults had Hypertension. This included 23% who had uncontrolled Hypertension, and 11% whose Blood Hypertension was controlled with medication. C men were more likely to have uncontrolled Hypertension than women (25% and 20%) (Figure 1). the proportion of adults with uncontrolled Hypertension increased with age from 7. 5% among those aged 1834 (10. 2% men, 4. 9% women) to a peak of 47% at age 85 and over (51% men, 48% women) (AIHW 2019). The proportion of Australian adults with Hypertension has been stable since 201112.

After adjusting for dierent population age structures, Indigenous adults were 1. 2 times as likely as non-Indigenous adults to have measured Hypertension (AIHW and NIAA 2022). The age-standardised prevalence rate of uncontrolled Hypertension in 201718 was 1. 3 times as High among those living in the lowest socioeconomic areas as among those living in the highest socioeconomic areas (AIHW 2019).

Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2024 Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease also known as Heart, stroke and vascular disease is a broad term that describes the many dierent diseases and conditions that aect the Heart and Blood vessels. Common types of cardiovascular disease in Australia include coronary Heart disease, stroke and Heart failure. D Cardiovascular disease and chronic Kidney disease are interrelated. Both diseases share common risk factors such as smoking, obesity, Hypertension, Diabetes and dyslipidaemia. Disease of one organ can impair function in the other. Cardiovascular disease can result in a reduced supply of Blood to the kidneys, which can lead to Kidney disease. People with chronic Kidney disease are at greater risk of coronary artery disease, Heart failureE, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. People with Kidney failure are at much higher risk of mortality due to cardiovascular disease (Go et al. 2004, Jankowski et al. 2021). In Australia, cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death among people who have chronic Kidney disease. An estimated 1. 2 million Australians aged 18 and over (6. 2% of the adult population) had 1 or more conditions related to Heart, stroke V or vascular disease, based on self-reported data from the ABS 201718 National Health Survey (AIHW 2021). The prevalence of Heart, stroke and vascular disease among adults in 201718: was higher among men (641, 000, an age-standardised rate of 6. 5%) than women (509, 000, an age-standardised rate of 4. 8%) I increased with age 26% of people aged 75 and over had Heart, stroke and vascular disease, compared with 1. 0% of adults aged 1844 (Figure 1). H Figure 1: Prevalence of self-reported Heart, stoke and vascular disease among people aged 18 and over, by age and sex, 201718 The bar chart shows the prevalence of self-reported Heart, stroke and vascular disease by age group in 201718.

R A Download data Variation between population groups In 201819, an estimated 42, 000 Indigenous adults (8. 6%) self-reported having Heart, stroke and vascular disease. After adjusting for dierent population age structures, Indigenous adults were 2. 1 times as likely as non-Indigenous adults to self-report having Heart, stroke and vascular disease (AIHW 2021). The age-standardised prevalence rate of self-reported Heart, stroke and vascular disease did not vary signicantly between adults living in the most and least disadvantaged socioeconomic areas in 201718.

Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2024 I H C R A Overweight and obesity Overweight and obesity refers to excess body weight. Excess weight, especially obesity, increases a persons risk of developing chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) by raising levels of Blood Hypertension and abnormal Blood abnormal Blood lipids, and placing people at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 Diabetes (NHMRC 2013). D Being overweight or obese can make it more dicult to control or manage chronic diseases. Overweight and obesity is also associated with higher rates of death (AIHW 2023, 2021). Evidence has shown that the risk of chronic kidney disease is almost 1. 5 times as High for an overweight but not obese person and almost twice as High for an obese person. Obese women have a higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease than obese men (Wang et al. 2008). E In adults, overweight and obesity is dened as a body mass index (body mass index) of 2529 kg/m2 and ≥30 kg/m2, respectively. This report uses body mass index to dene overweight and obesity. For information on waist circumference, see Waist circumference in Diabetes: Australian facts. V Based on measured body mass index from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2022 National Health Survey: one in 4 children and adolescents aged 217 (26%) were living with overweight or obesity. This is approximately 1. 3 million children I and adolescents. The proportion living with overweight or obesity was similar for boys and girls across most age groups, except for the youngest age group, where more girls aged 24 (24%) were living with overweight or obesity than boys (14%). H 66% of adults aged 18 and over were living with overweight or obesity, with 34% living with overweight but not obesity, and 32% living with obesity. men had higher rates of overweight or obesity than women (71% men, 61% women), and higher rates of obesity (33% men, 31% women). obesity was more common amCong older age groups 15% of men and 16% of women aged 1824 years were living with obesity, compared with 41% of men and 37% of women aged 6574 (AIHW 2024). After adjusting for dierent population age structures over time, the proportion of adults aged 18 and over living with overweight or obesity increased from 57% in 1995 to 65% in 2022. Over this time, the proportion living with overweight (but not obesity) declined from 38% to 34% bRut the proportion of those living with obesity increased, from 19% in 1995 to 31% (Figure 1) (AIHW 2024). See the Overweight and obesity report for more information. Figure 1: Proportion of overweight or obesity in children and adolescents aged 517, and adults aged 18 and over, 1995 to 2022 A Data show that in children and adolescents and adults the prevalence of overweight/obesity has generally increased from 1995 to 2022.

Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2024 Smoking Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in Australia today. Smoking increases Blood Hypertension, reduces Blood oxygen levels and damages Blood vessels, heightening the risk of plaques and clots. People who smoke are at increased risk for the development and progression of chronic kidneyD disease and that risk increases with greater lifetime exposure to smoking (Hallan and Orth 2011; Yacoub et al. 2010). Smoking contributes to negative outcomes for people with Kidney transplants (Mercado and Jaimes 2007). Smoking also contributes to the development of other chronic diseases closely linked to chronic Kidney disease, including cardiovascular disease and type 2 Diabetes (Briganti et al. 2002). Australias smoking rate has fallen over the past 40 years, largely attributable to pEublic health strategies. However, the proportion of people continuing to smoke is still concerning, particularly in some population groups such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and people living in Low socioeconomic areas (Greenhalgh et al. 2022). In 202223, based on results from the National Drug Strategy Household Survey: V 8. 3% of people aged 14 and over smoked daily (males 9. 0%, females 7. 7%) men and women aged 5059 had the highest proportion of current daily smokers (12. 1% and 11. 9%, respectively). Between 2001 and 202223: I the proportion age 14 and over who smoked daily decreased by 57% for both males and females daily smoking rates among males and femaleHs aged 1524 decreased by 74% and 82%, respectively (AIHW 2024). Use of e-cigarettes While the proportion of Australians who smoke tobacco may be declining, the use of e-cigarettes is becoming more common, particularly among young adults. CCurrent use of e-cigarettes among people aged 14 and over nearly tripled between 2019 (2. 5%) and 202223 (7. 0%) while quadrupling among people aged 18 24 (from 5. 3% to 21%) and increasing more than ve-fold among people aged 14 17 (from 1. 8% to 9. 7%) (AIHW 2024).

Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2024 Risk factors among adults with chronic Kidney disease This web page compares levels of 5 key chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) risk factors among adults with and without biomedical signs of chronic kidney disease. The populations with and without chronic kidney disease were obtained from the 201112 National Health Measures Survey (NHMS) the biomedical component of the Australian Health Survey (AHS) which is the most recent national survey to inDclude biomedical testing (ABS 2013). Adults who had biomedical signs of chronic kidney disease in the 201112 NHMS had signicantly higher levels of Diabetes, uncontrolled High Blood Hypertension and self-reported Heart, stroke and vascular disease, than adults who did not have biomedical signs of chronic kidney disease (Figure 1). These higher risk factor levels among adults who may have developed chronic kidney disease highlighEt the need for secondary prevention to limit the diseases further development and increased severity. Secondary prevention focuses on the early detection and best practice management of a disease or disorder to reduce deterioration and long-term eects. This includes identifying people at risk of ill-health through screening programs, general health examinations, as well as the identication of complications and co-morbidities. V Biomedical risk factors After adjusting for dierent population age structures, an estimated: 11% of adults who had biomedical signs of chronic kidney disease in the 201112 NHMS had Diabetes, 2. 6 times as High as the 4. 2% of adults without I chronic kidney disease who had Diabetes 27% of adults with biomedical signs of chronic kidney disease had uncontrolled Hypertension, 1. 5 times as High as the 18% of adults without H chronic kidney disease who had uncontrolled Hypertension 10% of adults with biomedical signs of chronic kidney disease reported having Heart, stroke or vascular disease, 2. 0 times as High as the 5. 1% of adults without chronic kidney disease who reported having Heart, stroke or vascular disease. Figure 1: Risk factor prevalenCce among adults with and without biomedical signs of chronic Kidney disease, 2011 12 The chart shows the proportion of risk factors among adults with and without biomedical signs of chronic Kidney disease in in 2011 12. R A D E V I H Download data Behavioural risk factors After adjusting for dierent populCation age structures, an estimated: 14% of adults with biomedical signs of chronic kidney disease in the 201112 NHMS were current smokers, similar to the 13% of adults without chronic kidney disease who were current smokers 54% of adults with biomedical signs of chronic kidney disease in the 201112 NHMS were overweight or obese, similar to the 58% of adults without chronic kidney disease who were oRverweight or obese. Although the dierences in this survey were not statistically signicant, smoking and overweight or obesity are considered risk factors for chronic kidney disease, as well as Diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which in turn are risk factors for chronic kidney disease.",

Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2024 D E V I H C R A Comorbidity of chronic Kidney disease Page highlights: Prevalence of chronic Kidney disease, Diabetes and Heart, stroke and vascular disease D In 201112, an estimated 2. 8 million Australian adults (18%) were living with Diabetes, chronic Kidney disease and/or Heart, stroke and vascular disease. Hospitalisations with chronic Kidney disease, Diabetes and cardiovascular disease In 202021, 23% (2. 2 million) non-Dialysis hospitalisations of people aged 18 oEr over involved chronic Kidney disease, Diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Comorbidities of people receiving Kidney replacement therapy In 2021, 44% of people receiving Kidney replacement therapy weVre living with Diabetes. Deaths from chronic Kidney disease, Diabetes and cardiovascular disease In 2021, 58% of adult deaths (99, 100) involved chronic Kidney disease, Diabetes or cardiovascular disease. I H What is multimorbidity and comorbidity? Many people with chronic health conditions do not have a single, predominant condition. Rather, they experience multimorbidity the presence of 2 or more chronic conditions in a person at the same time (AIHW 2021). C The health eect of multimorbidity can be greater than the combined eect of individual conditions. People with multimorbidity often have more severe illness and use more health services, including increased contact with primary health care services, with more complex hospitalisations and poorer outcomes. The additional heRalth conditions experienced by a person who has chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) is known as comorbidity. Diabetes and cardiovascular disease are common comorbidities among people with chronic kidney disease (AIHW 2007, 2014). On this web page, much of the focus is on the comorbidity of chronic kidney disease in combination with Diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease. An ageing population, along with unfavourable trends in some risk factors and a High prevalence of chronic disease in the comAmunity is expected to result in a rise in the number of people with chronic kidney disease comorbidity, and higher rates of chronic kidney disease among people with other chronic conditions. Based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 201718 National Health Survey (NHS), an estimated 238, 000 Australians had chronic kidney disease as a long-term condition. Almost all (234, 000 or 98%) had at least 1 of 9 other selected chronic conditions, including arthritis, mental and behavioural conditions, cardiovascular disease, back problems, Diabetes, osteoporosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer (ABS 2018a). chronic kidney disease was present in: 6. 6% of people with Heart, stroke and vascular disease 5. 8% of people with Diabetes 4. 4% of people with cancer 4. 3% of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ABS 2018a). Note that these data are based on self-report and rely on survey respondents providing accurate information some conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, are substantially under-reported in the NHS. Of the estimated 1. 7 million adults who had biomedical signs of chronic kidney disease in 201112, only 6. 1% reported having Kidney disease (ABS 2013a).",

D E V I H C Download data R Hospitalisations with chronic Kidney disease, Diabetes and cardiovascular disease Hospital comorbidity A On this web page, where a person has 2 or more of chronic kidney disease, Diabetes or cardiovascular disease present in the record of their episode of hospitalisation, it is referred to as comorbidity. Dialysis (including both haemodialysis and peritoneal Dialysis) hospitalisations have been excluded from this analysis, because they are often performed as routine treatments on a same-day basis and usually have no other comorbid diagnoses recorded. In 202021, there were around 2. 2 million non-Dialysis hospitalisations of people aged 18 or over in which chronic kidney disease, Diabetes or cardiovascular disease was recorded as the principal and/or an additional diagnosis. This equates to 23% of all non-Dialysis hospitalisations for people aged 18 and over. Of these, 383, 000 (17%) included chronic kidney disease, either alone (82, 700 or 3. 8%), or in combination with Diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease (301, 000 or 14%) (Figure 3). chronic kidney disease was more commonly comorbid with Diabetes (139, 000 or 6. 3%) than with cardiovascular disease (51, 800 or 2. 4%); however, it should be noted that Diabetes is universally coded on a patients hospital record. There were a further 110, 000 hospitalisations (5. 0%) where all 3 diseases were present. More than 1 in 100 hospitalisations of people aged 18 and over in 202021 involved all 3 diagnoses of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and Diabetes. Figure 3: Hospitalisations with chronic Kidney disease, Diabetes and cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease), people aged 18 and over, 202021 The Venn diagram shows the overlapping proportion of hospitalisations among adults in 202021 with chronic Kidney disease, Diabetes or cardiovascular disease as the principal and/or additional diagnosis. Among the hospitalisations for these conditions 3. 8% were for chronic kidney disease only, and 5. 0% of hospitalisations were for all 3 conditions. D E V I H C Download data Variation by age and sex R The rate of hospitalisation with comorbidity of chronic kidney disease, Diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease increases with age. In 202021, for example, people aged 65 and over were 5. 0 times as likely to have a combination of chronic kidney disease and Diabetes recorded on their hospital record as people aged 4564 (2, 400 and 477 per 100, 000 population). Men wAere more likely to be hospitalised with comorbidity than women. After adjusting for age, the rate of hospitalisation where all 3 diseases were recorded was 1. 7 times as High for men as for women. Hospital comorbidity in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population In 202021, there were 96, 600 non-Dialysis hospitalisations of Indigenous Australians aged 18 and over where chronic kidney disease, Diabetes or cardiovascular disease was present as a principal diagnosis and/or additional diagnosis. Of these hospitalisations, 34, 800 (36%) recorded 2 or 3 of the diseases 15, 700 (16%) recorded chronic kidney disease and Diabetes together, 1, 800 (1. 8%) recorded chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease, 8, 400 (8. 7%) recorded cardiovascular disease and Diabetes, and 8, 900 (9. 2%) recorded all 3 diseases (Figure 4). Among people with any diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, Diabetes or cardiovascular disease, a higher proportion of Indigenous adults had comorbidity in their record of hospitalisation, compared with non-Indigenous adults (36% and 21%).

Of the 3, 300 people who started KRT for Kidney failure in 2021: more than half (1, 700 or 51%) had type 1 or type 2 Diabetes 1, 100 (34%) had known or suspected coronary Heart disease 642 (20%) had known or suspected peripheral artery disease 457 (14%) had known or suspected chronic lung disease 362 (11%) had known or suspected cerebrovascular disease (mostly stroke). The presence of comorbid Diabetes on commencement of KRT has increased over the past 2 decades (Figure 5). In contrast, the presence of other comorbid conditions has declined since 2011. Figure 5: Comorbidities of new Kidney failure with replacement therapy patients, 2000 to 2021 The line chart shows the trend in comorbidities across 5 conditions for people with new cases of Kidney failure with replacement therapy, from 2000 to 2021. In 2021, Diabetes was the most common comorbidity for new patients receiving KRT (51%), followed by coronary Heart disease (34%), peripheral arterial disease (20%), chronic lung disease (14%) and cerebrovascular disease (11%). Over time, the proportion of new cases of Kidney failure with replacement therapy who had comorbid Diabetes has risen, while the remaining comorbidities have been relatively stable. D E V I H Download data Deaths from chronic kidneCy disease, Diabetes and cardiovascular disease Often, more than one disease contributes to a death. Along with the underlying cause of death, a medical practitioner or coroner will also record associated causes on a death certicate.

Figure 6: Proportion of deaths with chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease) and Diabetes listed as any cause of death, persons aged 18 and over, 2021 The Venn diagram shows the proportion of deaths among adults in 2020 with chronic Kidney disease, Diabetes or cardiovascular disease as any cause of death. Among deaths from these conditions, chronic kidney disease was recorded as the only cause in 4. 3% of deaths, and all 3 diseases were recorded as the underlying or associated cause in 4. 2% of deaths. D E V I H C R Download data Diseases commonly associated with chronic Kidney disease deaths When chronic kidney disease is the underlying cause of death, cardiovascular disease and/or Diabetes are often listed as associated causes of death A (Table 1). Acute Kidney failure (ICD-10 N17) was also often listed as an associated cause of death when the underlying cause of death was chronic kidney disease. Other causes that were commonly associated with chronic kidney disease deaths in 2021 included Heart failure (ICD10 I50), essential (primary) hypertension (I10), chronic ischaemic Heart disease (I25) and type 2 Diabetes mellitus (E11).

    "text": "The earlier chronic Kidney disease is detected, the better the outcomes for halting or slowing its proDgression. Depending on the stage of chronic Kidney disease a person is in, there are a variety of management options available. The best treatment option depends on the person being treated and the underlying condition that caused chronic Kidney disease. Treatment options may include lifestyle modications and medication. E Treatment and management of Kidney failure may involve Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) Dialysis or a Kidney transplant or comprehensive conservative care for those who choose not to undergo KRT. Supportive care can also be a part of the treatment and management of chronic Kidney disease, which focuses on helping a person live the best life possible regardless of what stage of chronic Kidney disease they are in or what treatments they are receiving. V Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2024 I H C R A General practice and primary health care One of the main goals of primary health care for chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) is the preservation of Kidney health. Collaboration between general practitioners (GPs), nurse practitioners, primary health care nurses and people with chronic kidney disease is recognised as an important part of the ongoing treatment and management of chronic kidney disease, and primary health care providers have a role in supporting individuals self-management of this condition (Bear and Stockie 2014; Havas et al. 2017; KHA 2020a). D Diagnosis and detection of chronic Kidney disease in general practice The asymptomatic nature of chronic kidney disease in stages 14 make GP and primary health care settings particularly important in detecting and reducing the burden of chronic kidney disease. E chronic kidney disease is chronically underdiagnosed in the Australian population, with only 6. 1% of adults who showed biomedical markers of chronic kidney disease in 201112 also self-reporting having the disease (ABS 2013). According to recent evidence, 88% of people with stages 12 chronic kidney disease and 80% of people with stage 3 chronic kidney disease may be undiagnosed (Khanam et al. 2019, NPS MedicineWise 2020). V Because chronic kidney disease requires signs of reduced Kidney function or damage to be present for at least 3 months, diagnosis involves biomedical assessments (Blood and/or Urine tests) to be repeated more than 3 months apart. This can make the disease more dicult to detect and diagnose. Given the rates of under-diagnosis and the High burden of chronic kidney disease, I targeted screening of individuals at increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease due to the presence of one or more risk factors and performing Kidney health checks of those people is the clinical protocol recommended in Australia for detecting chronic kidney disease (KHHA 2020a). Chronic Kidney disease management in general practice Kidney Health Australia guidelines for the clinical management of chronic kidney disease in primary health care involve regular monitoring of patients with chronic kidney disease (KHA 2020a). Although thCese guidelines are endorsed by The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the Australian Primary Health Care Nurses Association and the Australian and New Zealand Society of Nephrologists, complete monitoring of people with chronic kidney disease in Australia is inadequate (Khanam et al. 2019, NPS MedicineWise 2020). Clinical monitoring of chronic Kidney disease R Monitoring of chronic kidney disease depends on the level of Kidney function, with worse function requiring more assessments. Standard monitoring of chronic kidney disease requires the following tests: UrinAary albumin: Creatinine ratio (Urine albumin-creatinine ratio) is a Urine test to detect the presence of albumin (Protein) in the Urine, which would normally be ltered out by the kidneys.",

    "text": "If Kidney function is reduced, Protein may pass from the Blood into the Urine, causing albuminuria. Albuminuria is indicative of chronic kidney disease, even if other tests are normal (KHA 2017a). Estimated glomerular ltration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate) is a Blood test that provides an indication of how well the kidneys are ltering waste from the Blood. It is used to diagnose the stage of chronic kidney disease and to monitor progression of the disease (KHA 2020b). Electrolytes is a Blood test that measures Sodium and Potassium levels in the Blood, which should be properly balanced to maintain the normal function of metabolic processes. Glycated haemoglobin (hemoglobin hemoglobin A1c) is the main biomarker used to assess long-term glucose control in people living with Diabetes. It forms part of monitoring chronic kidney disease only in people with Diabetes. Fasting lipids are used to determine cardiovascular disease risk and monitor disease progression. Dyslipidaemia, or an altered lipid proBlood in the Blood, can accelerate the rate of Kidney function decline. Blood Hypertension tests are needed to identify Hypertension, which can both cause and exacerbate chronic kidney disease. Controlling High Blood Hypertension is an important component in the treatment and management of chronic kidney disease. Additional assessments that may be required depending on Kidney function include: Full Blood count can detect anaemia (deciency in the number or quality of red Blood cells) and monitor iron levels. Anaemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease, and can cause damage to other organs as well as reducing quality of life in severe cases. Calcium and phosphate need to be maintained at healthy levels to help protect against Heart disease and stroke, and to prevent bones from weakening. In more advanced stages of chronic kidney disease, the kidneys do not activate Vitamin D, which is necessary for the body to absorb calcium and phosphate. Calcium and phosphate levels may need to be controlled through diet and the use of phosphate binders and Vitamin D supplements (KHA 2017b). Parathyroid hormone (parathyroid hormone) can detect hyperparathyroidism, which disrupts calcium levels and can lead to Kidney failure. According to a recent study of people with chronic kidney disease in general practice, in 201819: 45% of those in Australian primary health care received complete monitoring (as dened by a record of Urine albumin-creatinine ratio, estimated glomerular filtration rate, cholesterol (lipids), hemoglobin hemoglobin A1c (if diabetic), haemoglobin (full Blood count), and Blood Hypertension measurement). among those with Diabetes, 68% received complete monitoring, compared with 28% of those Dwithout Diabetes. those with stages 12 chronic kidney disease were almost twice as likely to receive complete monitoring compared with those with stages 35 (81% compared with 41%), possibly due to a higher proportion of people with stages 12 chronic kidney disease having Diabetes (NPS MedicineWise 2020). Factors associated with reduced monitoring of chronic kidney disease were older age and living in a disadvantaged socioeconomic area, compared with co-existing Diabetes or hypertension, and having a documented chronic kidney disease diagnosis, whiEch were positively associated with complete monitoring (Khanam et al. 2019).

    "text": "Controlling Blood Glucose in Diabetes is important to reduce the risk of chronic kidney disease. V Methods of controlling Blood Glucose include medication and engaging in healthy lifestyle practices, including physical activity and eating a healthy diet. Medications often prescribed for type 2 Diabetes are: I insulin metformin H Sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors DPP-4 inhibitors glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonists/analogues. Sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitors C SGLT2 inhibitors are a class of glucose-lowering drugs used in managing type 2 Diabetes. They work by reducing the amount of glucose that is reabsorbed in the kidneys, promoting its excretion in the Urine. Multiple clinical trials have shown SGLT2 inhibitors to be eective in delaying the progression of chronic kidney disease in people with and without type 2 R Diabetes (Heerspink et al. 2020, Li et al. 2021, Neal et al. 2017, Perkovic et al. 2019). In September 2021, the Therapeutic Goods Administration approved dapagliozin for treatment of chronic kidney disease to reduce the risk of progressive decline in Kidney function in adults with proteinuric chronic kidney disease (stage 2, 3 or 4 and Urine albumin-creatinine ratio≥ 30 magnesium/g) (TGA 2021). In September 2022, treatment of chronic kidney disease was added to the Pharmaceutical Benets Scheme listing for dapagliozin (PBS 2022). A For more information, see Diabetes medicines. Managing cardiovascular disease Hypertension Hypertension was the primary cause of 12% of Kidney failure cases in people newly diagnosed with Kidney failure in Australia in 2021 (ANZDATA 2022). Hypertension can cause chronic kidney disease; however, chronic kidney disease both perpetuates and exacerbates High Blood Hypertension. Medications that may be prescribed to control Hypertension, include: ACE inhibitors ARBs beta blockers diuretics. As with all medication in people with chronic kidney disease, these need to be carefully monitored and adjusted or ceased depending on a persons individual circumstances and their level of Kidney function. High cholesterol Statins are a rst line treatment for managing High cholesterol; however, some research has indicated that the use of statins in people receiving Dialysis shows limited benets and can potentially be harmful (Kennard and Singer 2017). For people with chronic kidney disease not on Dialysis, combining statin therapy with ezetimibe has been shown to reduce the risk of adverse Kidney events compared with statin use alone (Bae et al. 2020, CARI Living Guideline Lipid Work Group 2021). For more information, see Medicines for cardiovascular disease. Managing medications in chronic Kidney disease In stages 35 chronic kidney disease, medicine use must be carefully managed. This is because medicines that are eDxcreted through the kidneys have the potential to build up in the body and be toxic to the kidneys or other organs (Hartmann et al. 2010). To avoid this, clinical assessment and management of medication are important components of treating and managing later stages of chronic kidney disease. Management should be tailored to each individual and may involve stopping or lowering the dosage of certain medications or, when available, using alternatives that are not eliminated from the body through the kidnEeys (Faull and Lee 2007, Hartman et al. 2010, KHA 2020). Because chronic kidney disease is typically caused by another health condition, comorbidity and multimorbidity are common. This means that many people with chronic kidney disease are prescribed complex medication regimens, which need to be monitored and adjusted to achieve the best V outcomes. Australians with chronic kidney disease were prescribed an average of 8. 4 medications between January 2013 and June 2016 (Castelino et al. 2020).",

    "text": "4 medications between January 2013 and June 2016 (Castelino et al. 2020). The use of multiple medications to manage underlying chronic cIonditions increases the chances of drug interactions, as well as adverse outcomes such as hospitalisation, falls, and mortality (Manski-Nankervis et al. 2021). In Australia, medication reviews are H subsidised under Medicare and may be benecial for people with chronic kidney disease to simplify their medication regimen. Potentially inappropriate medication use in clinical management of chronic Kidney disease Inappropriate prescribing in chronic kidney disease involves the prescription of medications that are ltered or excreted through the kidneys and C may potentially harm those taking them. As such, the types and dosages of medicines prescribed to people with chronic kidney disease should be carefully monitored. A potentially inappropriate prescription can include a contraindicated medicine, or too High a dose for a persons level of Kidney function. R In Australia, between 1. 5% and 2. 6% of people with chronic kidney disease were potentially inappropriately prescribed the combination of an ACE inhibitor, diuretic and non-steroidal anti-inammatory drug (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) (the triple whammy), according to estimates from 2016 and 2019 (Bezahbe et al. 2020, NPS MedicineWise 2020). Kidney Health Australia advises against using this combination of medicines in people with chronic kidney disease, due to the increased risk of acute Kidney injury. A Castelino and colleagues (2020) found that 35% of all Australians with chronic kidney disease were given at least one potentially inappropriate prescription. The rate of potentially inappropriate prescribing increased with the stage of chronic kidney disease, with 69% of people with stages 45 chronic kidney disease receiving at least one potentially inappropriate prescription.

V Supplementary chronic condition codes Data presented in this section are based on single episodes ofI care, including multiple hospitalisations experienced by the same individual. Because people receiving Dialysis are admitted for this purpose multiple times a week, hospitalisations involving Dialysis as the principal diagnosis are not included in anHalyses of chronic kidney disease hospitalisations, unless otherwise stated. For more information, see Hospitalisations for Dialysis. In 202021, approximately 2 million hospitalisations (17% of all hospitalisations in Australia) recorded chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) (including Dialysis) as a principal aCnd/or additional diagnosis. Dialysis accounted for 80% of chronic kidney disease hospitalisations in 202021. After excluding all hospitalisations where Dialysis was recorded as the principal diagnosis, chronic kidney disease hospitalisations accounted for 3. 3% of all hospitalisations in Australia in 202021.",

For people who required hospitalisation for one night or more, the average length of stay was 4. 8 days. Chronic Kidney disease is a broad term that includes multiple conditions that aect Kidney function, any of which might be recorded as the principal diagnosis causing hospitalisation. The most commonly recorded principal diagnosis for chronic kidney disease in 202021 was chronic Kidney disease, followed by Kidney tubulo-interstitial diseases (Table 1).

E Chronic Kidney disease hospitalisations as a principal or additional diagnosis When chronic kidney disease aects patient care during hospitalisation but is not the principal diagnosis it is recorded as an additional diagnosis. Except where Dialysis is the principal diagnosis, chronic kidney disease is more often coded as an additional diagnosis. V The leading principal diagnoses in 202021 when chronic kidney disease was listed as an additional diagnosis were: Heart failure: 20, 600 hospitalisations (6. 2%) type 2 Diabetes: 12, 100 hospitalisations (3. 6%) I sepsis (Blood poisoning): 11, 500 hospitalisations (3. 5%) acute Kidney failure: 10, 600 hospitalisations (3. 2%) H acute myocardial infarction (Heart attack): 7, 200 hospitalisations (2. 2%). chronic kidney disease is often comorbid with cardiovascular disease and Diabetes. In 202021, cardiovascular diseases (also known as circulatory diseases) were the most common type of principal diagnosis when chronic kidney disease was an additional diagnosis, accounting for 18% (60, 600) of these hospitalisations. Endocrine diseases, including type 1 and type 2 Diabetes, accounted for 8. 1% of hospitalisations where chronic kidney disease was C an additional diagnosis. Injuries were also common principal diagnoses when chronic kidney disease was an additional diagnosis (10. 8% or 35, 900 of these hospitalisations). Of these, complications associated with cardiac and vascular prosthetic devices, implants and grafts (6, 200 hospitalisations) and fractures of the femur (5, 300 hospitalisations) were the most common reasons for hospitalisation (Table 2). R chronic kidney disease is associated with an increased risk of fractures, due to disturbances in mineral and bone metabolism as a result of the disease (Moe et al. 2006). Progression or development of Kidney disease is also a risk associated with surgery, due to an increase in Creatinine following surgery (Ishani et al. 2011).

Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2024 Hospitalisations for Dialysis Page highlights In 202021, 1. 6 million (14%) of hospitalisations in Australia were for Dialysis. The number of hospitalisations for Dialysis nearly tripled between 200001 and 202021, froDm 582, 000 to 1. 6 million. In 202021, there were 264, 000 hospitalisations for Dialysis (as the principal diagnosis) among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, 30, 300 per 100, 000 population. Dialysis is the most common reason for hospitalisation in Australia, accounting for 14% of all hospitalisations in 202021 (1. 6 million E hospitalisations). Although the majority of people admitted to hospital for Dialysis receive haemodialysis, a small number receive peritoneal Dialysis. Data on this web page includes hospitalisations for both types of Dialysis. Hospitalisation data count the number of Dialysis episodes rather than the number of people who receive Dialysis. Most people undergoing Dialysis attend 3 sessions per week (ANZDATA 2021). V For more information about people receiving Dialysis, see Dialysis. What is Dialysis? I Dialysis is an articial way to remove waste and excess Water from the Blood, and regulate safe levels of circulating agents (such as Potassium, calcium and phosphorous) in the boHdy, a function usually performed by the kidneys. It is most often provided to treat chronic Kidney failure, but is sometimes needed in cases of acute Kidney failure, where the kidneys have been temporarily damaged due to illness or injury. There are 2 types of Dialysis: peritoneal Dialysis and haemodialysis. C Peritoneal Dialysis is an internal ltration process requiring the placement of a catheter (a thin, exible plastic tube) into the abdomen, which remains in place as long as Dialysis is required. Peritoneal Dialysis uses the peritoneal membrane inside the abdominal cavity to lter the Blood inside the body. The process involves lling the abdomen with a sterile Dialysis solution, called dialysate. Over 48 hours, waste is drawn out of the R Blood through the peritoneal membrane and into the dialysate. The used solution is then drained out of the body and replaced with a new solution. This process is called an exchange and takes around 3045 minutes. Between exchanges, the person is free to continue their usual activities. Peritoneal Dialysis can be performed either by the person 3 or 4 times during the day (continuous ambulatory peritoneal Dialysis) or automatically by a machine at night for about 810 hours A while the person sleeps (automated peritoneal Dialysis). As the necessary equipment is portable, peritoneal Dialysis can be performed almost anywhere.",

    "text": "As the necessary equipment is portable, peritoneal Dialysis can be performed almost anywhere. Individuals do not need to be in a hospital or clinic and can usually manage the procedure without assistance. Haemodialysis is an external ltration process where the Blood is diverted from the body to a machine which removes waste and excess uid. It involves an initial procedure to join an artery and vein together with either a stula or graft, that serves as the access point to the Dialysis machine (dialyser). Once this access point is ready, haemodialysis sessions take place for an average of 4 to 5 hours 3 times per week (ANZDATA 2021). Once the Blood has been ltered by the dialyser, it is returned to the body through the access point. Haemodialysis can be done at home or in specialised Dialysis centres located either in hospitals or satellite units. The process involves specialised plumbing installation for the dialyser and the person requires assistance to be connected to the machine. If performed at home, the procedure may be done more frequently for shorter periods or overnight. Sources: KHA 2016a, 2016b. Variation by age and sex In 202021, hospitalisation rates for Dialysis as the principal diagnosis: were 1. 6 times higher in males than in females. Age-specic rates for males were higher than those for females across all age groups increased with age up to ages 7584, with 76% of hospitalisations occurring in people aged 55 and over. Dialysis hospitalisation rates for males and females were highest among those aged 7584 (39, 000 and 19, 200 per 100, 000 population, respectively) (Figure 1). Figure 1: Dialysis hospitalisation rates, as a principal diagnosis, by age and sex, 202021 The bar chart shows hospitalisations for Dialysis by age and sex in 202021, which people aged 75-84 having the highest rates of hospitalisation. Prior to age 75, hospitalisations rates increase with age, and then decrease after age 85. The pattern was the same for males and females, with males having higher rates than females. D E V I H C R Download data Trends over time A The number of hospitalisations for Dialysis rose by 177% between 200001 and 202021, from 582, 000 to over 1. 6 million. After adjusting for changes in the age structure of the population over this time, this equated to an increase of 76% in the rate of Dialysis hospitalisations. Note that this does not capture trends in Dialysis performed outside of hospitals. The rate of hospitalisations for Dialysis among males was consistently higher than for females over the period, with both showing similar respective rates of increase (Figure 2). Figure 2: Trends in Dialysis hospitalisation rates, as a principal diagnosis, by sex, 200001 to 202021 The line chart shows the age-standardised trend in hospitalisations for Dialysis from 2000-01 to 202021, by sex.

    "text": "Prevalence of Kidney replacement therapy In 2021, 28, 500 people living with Kidney failure in Australia were receiving Kidney replacement therapy. I This web page presents statistics on the number of people with Kidney failure receiving Kidney replacement therapy (KRT), using data from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis andH Transplant (ANZDATA) Registry. Not all people with Kidney failure choose to undergo KRT. Instead, some opt to receive comprehensive conservative care, with a focus on quality of life and symptom control. Whether a person chooses to receive KRT is a personal decision, and may depend on a variety of factors, such as the persons age and C expected quality of life receiving KRT versus comprehensive conservative care. Person-centred care emphasises that the choice of what type of treatment to receive be made collaboratively by the person with Kidney failure, their families and their care team. Kidney failure R Kidney failure is the most severe form of chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease). It occurs when the kidneys can no longer function adequately on their own. People with Kidney failure require KRT to survive. KRT involves either Dialysis or a Kidney transplant. In 202A1, 72% of new Kidney failure cases were attributable to 4 causes: Diabetes (37%), glomerulonephritis (a type of Kidney inammation) (17%), hypertension (12%) and polycystic disease (the presence of multiple cysts in the Kidney) (6%) (ANZDATA 2022). Comprehensive conservative care and Kidney supportive care Not all people with Kidney failure undertake KRT comprehensive conservative care and management of Kidney failure is a treatment choice that focusses on patient care, quality of life and symptom control rather than on eorts to prolong life. Kidney supportive care aims to improve the quality of life of people living with chronic kidney disease, regardless of whether they are undergoing therapies intended to prolong life (Davison et al. 2015). This care includes preventing and relieving Pain and takes into account other physical, psychological, social or spiritual needs, helping people to live as actively as possible until death (WHO 2022). It emphasises shared decision-making between the person with chronic kidney disease, their families and their health care team. For a person near the end of their life, comprehensive conservative care with supportive care may be a more suitable form of care. Decisions on whether to start or withdraw from KRT are made by the person living with chronic kidney disease and their family. These decisions are informed by the persons health-care team (including their general practitioner and nephrologist); they consider peoples prognoses, as well as assessments of the persons anticipated quality of life (with or without Dialysis) and treatment burdens (AIHW 2016). For each person who started KRT in 2013, there was one person with Kidney failure who chose not to receive KRT (AIHW 2016). For more information on quality of life for people with chronic kidney disease, see Quality of life of people with chronic Kidney disease. The probability of not receiving KRT increases sharply from age 75 (Sparke et al. 2013). In 2013, the incidence of people not receiving KRT increased from 13 per 100, 000 population in those aged 6574, to 145 per 100, 000 in those aged 75 and over (Figure 1). Figure 1: Incidence of Kidney failure with and without replacement therapy, by age, 2013 The bar chart shows the incidence rate of Kidney failure in 2013 by sex, age group and Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) treatment status, from the AIHW analysis of the linked ANZDATA, AIHW National Mortality Database and National Death Index.

These age patterns are similar for men and women, with higher Kidney failure incidence rates observed for males. E V I H C R A Download data Incidence of Kidney replacement therapy An estimate of the incidence of KRT can be obtained from the ANZDATA Registry. This registry includes information on people who have had KRT in the form of Dialysis or a Kidney transplant. It does not contain information on people with Kidney failure who do not receive KRT. Not everyone with Kidney failure chooses to receive KRT, opting instead for medical management, with a focus on quality of life and symptom control. Therefore, estimates of the total prevalence of Kidney failure need to count cases of people who are receiving KRT and those who are not. Estimating the true incidence of Kidney failure in Australia requires linkage between ANZDATA and the National Death Index. This was most recently performed in 2013 and showed that of the 5, 100 new cases of Kidney failure in 2013, half (2, 500) were not receiving treatment with KRT (AIHW 2016). Work is underway by the AIHW to update this linkage (see Data gaps and opportunities). The total incidence of Kidney failure (treated and untreated) is an indicator in the Australian Health Performance Framework (AIHW 2022). Variation by age and sex During 2021, 3, 300 people with Kidney failure started KRT in Australia, at an average of 9 people per day (ANZDATA 2022). Of these, 67% were aged under 70 and 64% were males. In 2021, the incidence rate of KRT: was 1. 8 times as High in males as in females increased with age, to be highest among men aged 7579 and women aged 7074 (Figure 2). Figure 2: Incidence of Kidney replacement therapy, by age and sex, 2021 D The bar chart shows the number of new cases of Kidney failure with replacement therapy, by age group and sex, for 2021.

After adjusting for dierences in the age structure of the populations: the incidence rate of KRT among Indigenous Australians was 6. 2 times as High as that for non-Indigenous Australians Indigenous females started KRT at a rate 9. 4 times as High as that for non-Indigenous females Indigenous males started KRT at a rate 4. 4 times as High as that for non-Indigenous males (Figure 3).

Providing Dialysis services in remote regions of Australia has enabled more people to access care close to home. Between 2009 and 2016, there was a 42% increase in Dialysis treatments delivered in Central Australia (Gorham et al. 2016). In 2020, 26% of Indigenous Australians who received KRT (including Kidney transplantation) did so close to home, with a large increase in the prevalence of peritoneal Dialysis in the Northern Territory (ANZDATA 2021). In Central Australia, survival rates for haemodialysis are now higher than for the rest of Australia, going from the worst to the best in the country over the last 20 years (Gorham et al. 2016; UNE 2020). Community-led services are making it easier for people to access care in their Country. Purple House is an Indigenous owned health service, providing remote Dialysis, social support, aged care and National Disability InsurDance Scheme services. It operates 18 Dialysis units in Central Australia (Purple House 2022). Remoteness and socioeconomic area E Data for 20172021 show that the incidence rate of KRT was much higher in Remote and very remote areas and increased with socioeconomic disadvantage. After adjusting for dierences in the age structure of the populations, rates were: V 3. 7 times as High in Remote and very remote areas as in Major cities. Rates were 6. 7 times as High among females, but only 2. 2 times as High among males 1. 8 times as High in the lowest socioeconomic areas as in the highest socioeconomic areas (Figure 3). Figure 3: Incidence of Kidney replacement therapy, byI population group, 20172021 The bar chart shows rates of new cases of Kidney failure with replacement therapy by sex based on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status, remoteness area and socioeconoHmic area.

In 2021, the prevalence rate of KRT: was 1. 7 times as High in males as in females increased with age, to be highest among men aged 7579 (411 per 100, 000 population) and women aged 6569 (218 per 100, 000 A population) (Figure 5). Figure 5: Prevalence of Kidney replacement therapy, by age and sex, 2021 The bar chart shows the total prevalence rate of Kidney failure with replacement therapy by age and sex in 2021. Across all ages, more males than females were receiving KRT. The overall prevalence increased with increasing age until age 80 to 84. D E V I H Download data Type of Kidney replacement therapy The type of KRT received varies acCcording to age. In 2021, people with Kidney failure aged under 55 were more likely to have a functioning Kidney transplant than undergo Dialysis (Figure 6). Between ages 55 and 64, approximately half of the people receiving KRT had a functioning Kidney transplant (52%), and half received Dialysis (48%). R After age 65, people with Kidney failure were more likely to receive Dialysis than have a functioning Kidney transplant, with the proportion of people on Dialysis rising sharply from age 75. Figure 6: Proportion of Kidney replacement therapy type, by age, 2021 A The bar chart shows the total prevalence of Kidney failure with replacement therapy by age and type of KRT (Dialysis or transplant). The general pattern shows that the percentage of people treated with a transplant decreases with age, while Dialysis increases. Transplants were the most common for of KRT for those aged 0 to 64, with those aged 0 to 24 having the highest proportion of treatment with transplants (73%). Dialysis was the most common form of KRT in those aged 65 and over, increasing with age. 92% of those aged 85 receiving KRT were treated with Dialysis. For those aged 55 to 64, the prevalence of Dialysis and transplants was similar (48% and 52%, respectively). D E V I H Download data Variation between population groups Aboriginal and Torres Strait ICslander people Indigenous Australians with Kidney failure are more likely to receive Dialysis than a Kidney transplant, while non-Indigenous Australians with Kidney failure are equally likely to receive either KRT type (Figure 7). In 2021, 2, 600 IndigRenous Australians with Kidney failure received KRT, with 85% undergoing Dialysis and 15% having a Kidney transplant. In comparison, 51% of non-Indigenous Australians with Kidney failure received Dialysis and 49% had a Kidney transplant.

Australia has more than 100 Kidney care parent units that are typically based in hospitals, and over 300 locations for Dialysis treatment (ANZDATA 2022). It is common for parent units to be associated with one or more satellite units that provide access to Dialysis and transplantation services, and to inpatient hospital care. R In 2019, an ANZDATA survey found that the size of Kidney units varied considerably across Australia, with over half treating fewer than 250 patients, and the largest caring for well over 1, 000 patients. Kidney transplantation was available in 40% of the units. On average, each unit had 3 full-time consultant nephrology sta. Most units also had physician trainees, along with nurse practitioners, nurses, dietitians, social workers, pharmacists and transplant coordinators (McDonald et al. 2021).

In 2021, 857 Kidney transplant operations were performed in Australia. D Kidney transplantation is the preferred type of Kidney replacement therapy (KRT), as it lowers long-term mortality risk and costs, and increases quality of life (Liem et al. 2008). Following transplantation, care directed towards preventing chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) is required (KHA 2021). E Successful Kidney transplants where recipients are still living with their transplant, regardless of how many years ago they received it, are referred to on this web page as functioning Kidney transplants. A total of 857 Kidney transplant operations were performed in Australia in 2021, with 9 in 10 of these being the rst Kidney transplant. V Of all transplanted kidneys in 2021, 655 (76%) were from deceased donors and 202 (24%) were from living donors (ANZDATA 2022). Transplanted kidneys can be donated by either deceased or living donors. The number of donated kidneys available for transplantation is insucient to meet demand. As at 1 May 2023, 1, 450 Australians were on the Kidney transplant waiting list (ANZOD 2023). I A total of 729 Kidney transplants from deceased donors took place in 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic substantially aected activity to H do with organ donation and transplantation 857 Kidney transplants from deceased donors took place in 2019, falling to 704 in 2020 (ANZOD 2022).

Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2024 D E V I H C R A Impact of COVID-19 The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on Australias population and health care system in multiple ways, including on economic expenditure, mortality, disability, health workforce and disease surveillance. The next web page explores the impact of COVID-19 in Australia for people living with chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease). Data available on chronic kidney disease across the COVID period are limited by the availability of data on the contiDnuing pandemic period, as well as the lack of longer term data. There will likely be long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with chronic kidney disease, even on those who do not become infected with COVID-19, due to delays in care for chronic conditions such as chronic kidney disease, Diabetes and cardiovascular disease (Yende and Parikh, 2021). E Kidney transplants in Australia Organ donation numbers and transplants have declined as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (OTA 2021). In response to COVID-19, adult Kidney transplant programs were suspended from 24 March 2020 to mid-May 2020. V Pauses in transplant surgery particularly aected those with chronic kidney disease, as more than half of transplanted organs are kidneys. In 2020, there was an 18% drop in the number of Kidney transplants from deceased donors compared with 2019 (704 and 857 transplants, respectively). 2021 saw a decrease of 6. 8% compared with 2020 (656 transplants) (OTA 2020, 2021). I Donations from living donors are classied as elective surgery; therefore, pauses in elective surgery aected the number of transplants from living donors. There was a 24% drop in living Kidney donors in 2020; in 2021, the number of living Kidney donors rose H by 12% compared with 2020 (202 and 182 donors) (OTA 2021). Chronic Kidney disease hospitalisations In 202021, there were over 4, 700 hospitalisations involving a diagnosis of COVID-19 in Australia. Of these, 394 (8.",

This includes type 2 Diabetes (19%, 188 deaths) and cardiovascular disease (20%, 189 deaths), which are often comorbid with chronic kidney disease. The death rate for people with chronic kidney disease and COVID-19 was also higher than for people with multiple comorbid conditionRs who were hospitalised with COVID-19 (26%) and people with no comorbid conditions (4. 7%) (AIHW 2022). Hospital admissions for people with chronic kidney disease fell sharply between March and April 2020, when lockdown measures were introduced nationwide by the Australian Government. In April 2020, chronic kidney disease hospitalisations declined by 16% among males and by 18% among females, compared with gures for April 2019 (Figure 1(b)).

Between March and April in 2019-20, there was a large drop in the number of chronic kidney disease hospitalisations not seen to the same extent in the previous 2 years, that coincided with the onset of restrictions brought in to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of hospital admissions for chronic kidney disease in 202021 were comparable to years prior to 201920. Figure 1b: The line chart shows the per cent change in the number of hospital admissions for chronic kidney disease from January 2019 to June 2020 for males, females and persons. Compared to the previous year, hospital admissions decreased by 17% in April 2020. This aect was greater for females (declining 18%) than males (declining by 16%). D E V I H Download data Chronic Kidney disease emergency department presentations C From July 2018 to June 2021, the average number of chronic kidney disease-related ED presentations each month was around 3, 400. The number of presentations ranged between 2, 800 (April 2020) and 4, 200 (January 2020) during this period. Between January 2020 and April 2020, the rate of chronic kidney disease-related ED presentations fell by about 32% (16 to 11 presentations per 100, 000 population). This deRcline coincides with the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions in early 2020. The rate of ED presentations gradually increased between April 2020 and January 2021 (Figure 2).

Additional research suggests that cases of acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients may be much higher than this, if an extended denition of acute kidney injury is used to capture cases where the disease occurs before hospitalisation, or early in a hospital admission (Wainstein et al. 2022). R A meta-analysis of international data published up to October 2020 showed that 19% of acute kidney injury patients with COVID-19 who were in an intensive care unit started Kidney replacement therapy (Silver et al. 2020). Early reporting suggests that 6 months post-acute COVID-19 infection, around 35% of patients have an estimated glomerular ltration rate (AeGFR) of 90 milliliters per minute/1. 73m2, including 13% who did not have acute kidney injury and had normal estimated glomerular filtration rate on discharge (Huang et al. 2021). The long-terms impacts of COVID-19 and its association with a decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate are not well understood; however, early evidence suggests that people who experienced COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury are at increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease with the severity of acute kidney injury associated with larger declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate 12 months post-acute COVID-19 infection (Gu et al. 2022; Hultström et al. 2021).

V Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2024 I H C R A Impact of chronic Kidney disease Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) is a serious disease that has a substantial impact on individuals, families and the Australian health system. This section comments on the quality of life of people living with chronic kidney disease, and presents 2 key measures of impact: D estimates of the burden of disease of chronic kidney disease estimates of expenditure on chronic kidney disease. Quality of life of people with chronic Kidney disease E Quality of life has no agreed denition but is often described in terms of subjective well-being and life satisfaction. When applied to health, it refers to the eects of disease, injury or treatments as perceived and reported by the individuals themselves (Morton and Webster 2014). V chronic kidney disease can aect a persons quality of life in many ways. Symptoms such as Fatigue, uid retention, bone Pain, peripheral neuropathy or sleep disturbance as well as side eects from medication or Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) can adversely aect daily living (Eranga Yapa et al. 2021). chronic kidney disease diagnosis and progression may have an impact on mental health, most commonly through experiencing grief, anxiety or depression. Limitations on diet and travel for those on Dialysis, satisfaction with care or unmet needs for information and support services, nancial demands, and Ispiritual well-being can also aect quality of life. Quality of life declines as a persons Kidney damHage and loss of function increases (Morton and Webster 2014). Each stage of chronic kidney disease from diagnosis through decline of Kidney function, KRT with Dialysis or transplantation, to end-of-life care can have a negative impact (Bonner et al. 2018). For some people with chronic kidney disease, quality of life becomes a more important consideration than length of life, and they may decide to end their Dialysis treatment in favour of end-of-life care. In 201112, adults with biomedicCal signs of chronic kidney disease were more likely to rate their health as fair/poor, than adults without biomedical signs of chronic kidney disease (23% and 12%) (AIHW analysis of ABS 2013). chronic kidney disease has a greater impact on the quality of life of younger people than older people (Francis et al. 2019, Tong et al. 2013). The combination of chronic kidney disease and Diabetes also has an adverse impact people with both diseases have substantially poorer quality of life than those with only one of these diseases (Wyld et al. 2021).

Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2024 D E V I H C R A Burden of chronic Kidney disease Page highlights: In 2023, chronic Kidney disease accounted for 1. 1% of the total burden of disease in Australia. In 2018, chronic Kidney disease accounted for 2. 5% of total burden in First Nations people. D What is burden of disease? Burden of disease is a measure of the years of healthy life lost from living with or dying from disease and injury. E The measure used is the disability adjusted life year (DALY). This measure combines health loss from living with illness and injury (non-fatal burden, or years of life lost due to disability YLD) and dying prematurely (fatal burden, or years of life lost YLL) to estimate total health loss (total burden, or DALY). V Burden of disease estimates seek to capture both the quantity and health-related quality of life, and to reect the magnitude, severity and impact of disease and injury within a population. Burden of disease does not quantify the social or nancial consequences of disease and injury. The Australian Burden of Disease Study provides estimates foIr over 200 diseases and injuries in Australia, including chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease), which is included as part of the Kidney and Urinary Disease group. Note that the denitions of chronic kidney disease in this study are dierent from those used to dene chronic kidney disease in otheHr sections of this report. Further information can be found in Australian Burden of Disease Study 2023. Note: The Australian Burden of Disease Study 2023 does not include estimates by Remoteness areas, Socioeconomic groups or risk factors. The most recent estimates are presented in the Australian Burden of Disease Study: Impact and causes of illness and death in C Australia 2018and Australian Burden of Disease Study 2018: Interactive data on risk factor burden reports. In 2023, Australians lost an estimated 63, 400 years of healthy life (DALY) due to chronic kidney disease, equivalent to 2. 4 DALY per 1, 000 population(AIHW 2R023). chronic kidney disease accounted for 1. 1% of the total burden of disease in Australia in 2023 (1. 2% males, 1. 1% females) (Figure 1). Most of the burden from chronic kidney disease (72%) came from years of life lost to premature death (YLL), with the remainder (28%) from years lived with illness (YLD). A Figure 1: Total burden of chronic Kidney disease compared with disease groups, 2023 The tree chart shows the burden of disease groups (such as cancer and other neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases and musculoskeletal conditions) compared with the burden of chronic kidney disease. In 2023, chronic kidney disease accounted for 63, 448 DALY. In contrast, the largest burden of disease group Cancer and other neoplasms accounted for 934, 551 DALY.",

Figure 2: Burden of disease for chronic Kidney disease, by age and sex, 2023 A The bar chart shows the total burden of disease (DALY) for chronic kidney disease for males and females across 22 age groups, from 0 to age 100.

Trends over time R The rate of burden from chronic kidney disease was similar in 2003 and 2023 age-standardised rates of 1. 7 and 1. 8 DALY per 1, 000 population, respectively (AIHW 2023). The 49% increase in DALY from chronic kidney disease between 2003 and 2018 (16, 200 DALY) was estimated to be driven by population growth (29% orA 9, 600 DALY) and population ageing (20% or 6, 500 DALY) (AIHW 2021a). First Nations people Burden of disease estimates for First Nations people for 2018 (AIHW 2022a, b) show that: chronic kidney disease accounted for 2. 5% (6, 100 DALY) of total burden in First Nations people in 2018 (2. 0% males, 3. 1% females) 73% of the burden from chronic kidney disease among First Nations people was fatal, and 27% was non-fatal the burden from chronic kidney disease was greater in females (58%, 3, 500 DALY) than in males (42%, 2, 600 DALY) the burden from chronic kidney disease rose rapidly in First Nations people from age 4044, peaking at ages 5054. Overall, over 80% of the burden from chronic kidney disease (4, 900 DALY) occurred in people aged 4074 the rate of burden from chronic kidney disease was 7. 8 times as High for First Nations people as for non-Indigenous Australians chronic kidney disease was responsible for 4. 0% of the total male health gap and 6. 5% of the total female health gap between First Nations and nonIndigenous Australians. Contribution of risk factors A portion of burden of disease is preventable, being due to modiable health risk factors. The Australian Burden of Disease Study 2018 estimated the disease burden that can be attributed to these modiable risk factors (AIHW 2021b). This study provides estimates for burden due to impaired Kidney function as a risk factor for other diseases, including coronary Heart disease, dementia, stroke, gout and peripheral vascular disease. In 2018, 1. 9% of the total disease burden in Australia was due to impaired Kidney function (including chronic kidney disease). Note that the study considers that impaired Kidney function was responsible for the entire burden of chronic kidney disease. Of the total burden of chronic kidney disease in Australia in 2018, 100% was attributable to all risk factors combined of those estimated in the study, including impaired Kidney function.",

More specically, the most common underlying causes of death, by 3-digit International Statistical Classication of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code, were: R chronic ischaemic Heart disease (10. 8%) acute myocardial infarction (4. 4%) Heart failure (4. 2%) other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4. 1%). A type 2 Diabetes mellitus (4. 0%) unspecied dementia (4. 0%) In about a third of cases where chronic kidney disease was listed as an associated cause of death, the underlying cause was a disease of the circulatory system. This reects the common comorbidity of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular diseases (see Comorbidity of chronic Kidney disease for more information). Epidemiological data also suggest that individuals with chronic kidney disease are at increased risk of experiencing cognitive impairment and of developing dementia (Bugnicourt et al. 2013). This may explain why chronic kidney disease is commonly listed as an associated cause of death in deaths due to unspecied dementia. In cases where chronic kidney disease was the underlying cause of death, the most common groups of associated causes included: diseases of the circulatory system (41%) such as Heart failure (10%), primary hypertension (8. 3%) and chronic ischaemic Heart disease (5. 2%) endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (14%) such as type 2 and unspecied Diabetes mellitus (5. 7% and 3. 9%, respectively) diseases of the respiratory system (8. 0%) such as pneumonia, organism unspecied (1. 9%) and other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1. 8%) diseases of the genitourinary system (6. 8%) such as acute Kidney failure with tubular necrosis (5. 2%).

    "text": "Although national health information collections continue to develop and improve, there are still gaps and the information collected may not always be brought together eciently for analysis (AIHW 2022a). Increasing digitisation of health information means more detailed data are being collected, expanDding the possibilities for analysing and reporting. There is greater demand for information that: is easily accessible, exible and interactive is comparable at national, subnational and at smaller geographic levels maintains privacy and condentiality. E The National Strategic Action Plan for Kidney Disease identies several data priorities that can drive improvements in the eectiveness and eciency of Kidney disease prevention, treatment and support (Department of Health 2019). Key priorities include expanding the collecting of person-centred data, and increasing data linkage and integration. V Comprehensive person-centred data Following individuals from a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease through their interactions with the health system improves our ability to analyse not only the development and trajectory of disease but also the inteIrplay of determinants and interventions and the role and performance of the health system in preventing, treating and managing chronic kidney disease. H Current opportunities to improve consumer-led and person-centred chronic kidney disease data includes: collecting comprehensive data at all points of primary health care activity, particularly at diagnosis and early treatment of early and mid-stage chronic kidney disease. This can provide a fuller picture of chronic kidney disease management, including associated comorbidities, early interventions and long-term outcomes as well as improving estimates of incidence, prevalence and early treatment. A National Primary Health Care C Data Collection is currently under development (AIHW 2022b). conducting regular health surveys that measure markers of chronic kidney disease and other markers of chronic disease and nutrition status. This will allow population health trends in the Australian population to be better determined. The Australian Bureau of Statistics is undertaking a multi-year Intergenerational Health and Mental Health Study in 20202024, which will include a biomedical component (ABSR 2022). detailed information for priority population groups, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people from lower socioeconomic areas, people with disability, and culturally and linguistically diverse populations. These groups may experience substantial disadvantages in relation to Kidney health and in accessing health services. data for smaller geographical areas to identify variations in health status and care by location. The AIHW has published several A dynamic dashboards to show the distribution of the impact of chronic kidney disease by geographic levels (AIHW 2021). Commonwealth investment in chronic Kidney disease research Between 2000 and 2022, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has expended 469 million towards research relevant to Kidney disease. From its inception in 2015 to 31 March 2023, the Medical Research Future Fund has invested 37. 40 million in 22 grants with a focus on Kidney disease research (including chronic Kidney disease research). This includes: 2. 00 million to Monash University for the PROPHECY chronic kidney disease study to reduce the burden of chronic Kidney disease in Indigenous Australians. 2. 23 million to University of New South Wales for the project, Dapagliozin in advanced chronic Kidney disease and Kidney failure: The RENAL LIFECYCLE trial. Data linkage and integration Data on the Australian health system are largely organised around occasions of service. Data linkage, also known as data integration, brings together information from more than one source. Matching disparate pieces of information can ll gaps in knowledge on not only specic diseases and the eectiveness and quality of health services and population groups but also across the health and welfare sectors.",

    "text": "Linking these data, together with other data such as from surveys, allows for a richer understanding of how people and population groups interact with health services, and their health outcomes. Two examples of recently linked data sets include the National Integrated Health Services Information Analysis Asset, developed by the AIHW, and the Multi-Agency Data Integration Project developed by the Australian Bureau of StatiDstics (AIHW 2022a). Current opportunities presented by health data linkage include: linking primary care data with the existing Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) and Australia and New Zealand Organ Donation Registry databases. This linkage will assist in building a comprehensive picture of clinical measures of E chronic kidney disease and long-term outcomes; it will also facilitate research and the monitoring and evaluation of policies and programs (Department of Health 2019). linking ANZDATA and the National Death Index, to ascertain the true incidence of Kidney failure by also counting people with nonKRT-treated Kidney failure. The AIHW is currently working to develop the Kidney and Diabetes Data Integration project for this purpose. This dataset will provide information on individuals with Vdiabetes and Kidney disease, their treatment, their health service usage, and their Diabetes-related complications and comorbidity over time. The AIHW and researchers will use this dataset to develop new methodologies to rene the national monitoring of chronic kidney disease.

C Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study The Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab) is a national survey that was conducted by the International Diabetes Institute (now Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute). It collected national measurements of chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) biomarkers: serum Creatinine and albuminuria for an adult population aged 25 and over (11, 700 people). Of the eligible households, 70% R responded to the biomedical survey, and 37% of eligible respondents got tested (Dunstan et al. 2002). Standardised Creatinine results from the survey participants were supplied by the research team to conduct this analysis on comparable estimated glomerular ltration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate) measures. For more information on AusDiab, see About AusDiab - external site opens in new window. A National Health Measures Survey In 201113, the Australian Heath Survey incorporated the rst Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) biomedical collection the National Health Measures Survey. It involved the collection of a range of Blood and Urine tests from over 11, 000 participants across Australia, which were then tested for various chronic disease and nutrient biomarkers. Urine samples were collected from respondents aged 5 and over, and Blood samples from respondents aged 12 and over. 36% of the survey participants volunteered to get the biomedical tests, covering 85% of the sampled households. chronic kidney disease biomarkers collected were used to derive the estimated glomerular filtration rate measure from the chronic kidney disease-epi formula and the albumin: Creatinine ratio (ABS 2014, Johnson et al. 2012).

E Previous versions of the NHS have primarily been administered by trained ABS interviewers and were conducted face-to-face. The 202021 NHS was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. To maintain the safety of survey respondents and ABS Interviewers, the survey was collected via online, self-completed forms.

As this was not possible during lockdown periods, there were lower response rates than previous NHS cycles, which impacted sample representativeness for some sub-populations. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19 and lockdowns might also Ihave had direct or indirect impacts on peoples usual behaviour over the 202021 period. Therefore, this report uses data from the 201718 NHS. H The NHS collects self-reported data on whether a respondent had one or more long-term health conditions; that is, conditions that lasted, or were expected to last, 6 months or more. This report uses self-reported data to derive prevalence estimates for risk factors for chronic kidney disease. It does not use self-reported data for the incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease itself, because estimates based on these data are considered to be unreliable and vastly undercount C the number of people with chronic kidney disease in Australia. When interpreting data from the 201718 NHS, some limitations need to be considered: Data that are self-reported rely on respondents knowing and providing accurate information. The survey doesR not include information from people living in nursing homes or otherwise institutionalised. Residents of Very remote areas and discrete First Nations communities were excluded from the survey.

AIHW National Hospital Morbidity Database The AIHW National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) is a compilation of episode-level records from admitted patient morbidity data collection systems in Australian hospitals. Reporting to the NHMD occurs at the end of a persons admitted episode of care (separation or hospitalisation) and is based on the clinical documentation for that hospitalisation. The NHMD is based on the Admitted Patient Care National Minimum Data Set (APC NMDS). It records information on admitted patient care (hospitalisations) in essentially all hospitals in Australia, and includes demographic, administrative and length-of-stay data, as well as data on the diagnoses of patients, the procedures they underwent in hospital and external causes of injury and poisoning. D The hospital separations data do not include episodes of non-admitted patient care given in outpatient clinics or emergency departments. Patients in these settings may be admitted later, with the care provided to them as admitted patients being included in the NHMD.
