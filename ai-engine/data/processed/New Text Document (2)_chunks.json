Although it fluctuates over the 24-heart rate day and night, the morning blood pressure increases after waking up and declines throughout sleep. It is typical for blood pressure to decrease by 10% to 20%, while sleeping, known as dipping blood pressure. However, if there is no decrease in nighttime mean systolic blood pressure or a drop of less than 10 mmHg, it is called nondipping blood pressure. Conversely, reverse dipping blood pressure means an increase in mean systolic blood pressure instead of a drop during the night. Reverse dipping is observed in hypertension (hypertension), Diabetes mellitus (diabetes mellitus), chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome. The introduction of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) led to the emergence of identifying normal and elevated blood pressure patterns. Non-dipping blood pressure increases the risk of cardiovascular system (CVS) complications such as left ventricular hypertrophy, proteinuria, glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate) reduction, and chronic kidney disease progression. A loss or blunting of the normal blood pressure profile is recognized as a deleterious variant, and restoring abnormal blood pressure patterns has been reported to significantly impact end-organ damage, morbidity, and mortality. In this non-systematic clinically-oriented, comprehensive review, we aim to update the blood pressure variables and the pathophysiology of nondipping blood pressure and point out the areas which need more investigation from a nephrology perspective because the nondipping blood pressure increases the risk of proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate reduction, and chronic kidney disease progression. A literature search of PubMed, Google, EMBASE, and Google Scholar was conducted. Checks of selected papers and relevant reviews complemented the electronic search. With improved blood pressure measurement methods, the physiology of blood pressure profile variations is readily detectable during the day and night. A nondipping blood pressure profile is a distinct blood pressure pattern that may have significant end-organ damage effects and therapeutic importance for nephrologists. The pathophysiology of the nondipping blood pressure variant must be clarified to prevent complications, and further investigations are required. Furthermore, there is debate about the best blood pressure index to utilize: systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial Hypertension, or a mixture of all. All these areas are important and need new research projects. Introduction Background Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) is a widespread and significant illness with a global public health impact. Diabetes mellitus (diabetes mellitus) and hypertension (hypertension) significantly affect chronic kidney disease prevalence 1. The increasing incidence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus and the aging society significantly contribute to the rise in chronic kidney disease patients 2. Previous epidemiological studies showed that the risks of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and end-stage renal disease (end-stage renal disease) increase in chronic kidney disease 3.",

    "text": "Several risk factors affect renal function in chronic kidney disease patients 4, and Hypertension (blood pressure) is often considered a significant cause and a predictor 5. blood pressure control in chronic kidney disease patients is crucial to prevent cardiovascular disease, the progression of chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease development 6, 7. However, determining blood pressure is still up for question; notably, the accuracy and reproducibility of traditional clinical blood pressure measurement methods are used 8. The previously reported studies showed that blood pressure records taken outside of clinic settings through ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) or at home had a more significant correlation with the frequency of CV events and the consequent deterioration in Kidney function 9. Not only does ABPM enable the identification of white-coat and masked hypertension, but it also permits the categorization of daily blood pressure profiles or patterns 10, 11. Furthermore, abnormal nocturnal blood pressure measurements and patterns assessed by ABPM had more harmful effects than High office blood pressure readings 10, 11. Normally, there is a 10%-20% reduction in blood pressure at night, which is a physiological variation 12. Individuals who have a decline in the nighttime blood pressure are called dippers, while those without such a drop in blood pressure during the night are recognized as non-dippers 13. The nondipper blood pressure profile is frequently witnessed in chronic kidney disease patients 11, 14. Clinical observational reports demonstrated that the nondipper blood pressure profile is frequently complicated by end-organ, such as Kidney damage. Renal damage manifests with increased urinary albumin excretion 15, which is a strong predictor of the progression of renal insufficiency 16. Normotensive non-dippers may develop chronic kidney disease because the nondipping blood pressure profile precipitates atherosclerosis in the renal arteries in IgA nephropathy 17. The target blood pressure of ABPM has not yet been determined because of the paucity of appropriate clinical data, especially from interventional clinical studies using ABPM-based controls. Furthermore, it is not yet clearly proven that the normotensive nondipper pattern is associated with chronic kidney disease progression. This is a comprehensive non-systematic review article. The institutes ethical committee has deemed obtaining ethical approval for this type of work unnecessary. A literature search was performed in PubMed, Google, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Checks of selected papers and relevant reviews complemented the electronic search. Studies were recognized by crossing the following keywords and terms: ambulatory blood pressure, nocturnal blood pressure, reverse dipping, inverted dipping, altered circadian blood pressure rhythm, hypertension, target organ damage, Kidney and hypertension, Kidney, and dipping blood pressure, abnormal blood pressure pattern-related mortality, and other phrases. Review Blood Hypertension physiology The autonomic nervous system (ANS), particularly sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, is the primary determinant of circadian changes in blood pressure. However, other neurohormonal systems that control blood pressure also affect circadian rhythm, suggesting their involvement in diurnal fluctuations in blood pressure 18. According to numerous research, increased Sodium consumption and salt sensitivity are linked with the decrease or even inversion of some participants typical nocturnal dipping 19, 20. Fukuda et al. contend that an impairment in the daytime renal Sodium excretion is the underlying reason for the nondipping pattern of the night blood pressure 21. Therefore, the blood pressure rises during nighttime to encourage Sodium excretion to maintain a 24-hour Sodium balance. The diminished ability to excrete Sodium may be brought on by either a decrease in renal function, as seen in those with Low an estimated glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate), or a rise in Sodium reabsorption in the tubules, for instance, in primary aldosteronism 22.",

    "text": "Several modest investigations of selected salt-sensitive and salt-resistant individuals provide the main evidence for the theory connecting the dipping pattern to the ability to excrete Sodium at night 20. A 24-hour blood pressure reading, renal function, and day with overnight Urine samples revealed elevated urinary Sodium in normal and hypertensive African-American people 23. Urine Sodium concentration decreases due to V2-antidiuretic hormone (ADH) receptor increased activity in the collecting duct of the neuron by ADH. Inhibition of this action leads to increased Sodium excretion. During the day, the plasma ADH level is higher than at nighttime, leading to more Sodium reabsorption by nephron tubules and collecting ducts, leading to a higher body content of Sodium during the daytime. ADH and other vasopressor hormone plasma levels decrease during nighttime, leading to more loss of Sodium and the consequent dipping of blood pressure. This theory was supported by a clinical study by Bankir et al. 24. Another study evaluated the effect of tolvaptan (a selective vasopressin receptor antagonist) on the parts of nephron which handle Water and Sodium equilibrium. Systemic hemodynamics revealed that the reduction of Water excretion by the nephrons is dose-dependent. In contrast, the reduction in Sodium excretion was dose-independent, partly through an AVP-dependent mechanism 25. Thus, tolvaptan counteracted the kidneys ability to diminish Sodium and Water loss caused by nitric oxide inhibition. Tolvaptans failure to reduce the excretion of Urine by the aquaporin-2 channels may be due to the High plasma ADH concentration 25. Therefore, activation of V2 receptors enhances salt and Water reabsorption while not dependent on vasopressin concentration alone. There still seems to be a lack of clear understanding of these mechanisms, which necessitates further research in this area. Another suggested theory for the dipping of blood pressure at sleeping is position. While sleeping, humans lie flat, which logically causes blood pressure to drop. Furthermore, during sleeping, autonomic nerve activity alters by decreasing sympathetic and increasing parasympathetic, affecting blood pressure. Moreover, Blood flow redistribution and decreased Blood pooling in lower limbs compared with an upright position increase Kidney Blood flow, estimated glomerular filtration rate, Sodium filtration, and excretion in lying down. Although these are suggestive blood pressure dipping mechanisms at night, further investigatory studies are required to prove or disprove them. Blood Hypertension measurement and Blood Hypertension types Historically, blood pressure measurement was usually done by physicians. As time evolved, the nurses and even the patients started to measure it, using oscillometric automatic blood pressure machines. The ABPM allows blood pressure measurement while the subject is awake or asleep. ABPM is usually taken every 20-30 minutes throughout the daytime and every hour during sleeping 26. The means of the blood pressure readings at night and day are calculated. The mean of the daily readings is known as day blood pressure and at night while sleeping, called night, nocturnal, or blood pressure during sleep readings. The mean percentage of systolic blood pressure reduction by about 10-20% during sleep is called dipping blood pressure. However, people who have 10% drop of their blood pressure are labeled as nondippers. In some subjects, measuring the blood pressure at the doctors office can be less informative and nonconfirmatory without ambulatory monitoring. ABPM might be a superior blood pressure recording method than office readings for certain blood pressure patterns including masked and white-coat hypertension. ABPM seems to be a more reliable predictive method and the best for the prediction of death as compared to the clinic blood pressure measurement 27. The ABPM may define the physiological status, assess the efficacy of the antihypertensive medications, and detect white-coat, masked, and uncontrolled masked hypertension 8.",

    "text": "The 2018 Guidelines for the Management of Arterial hypertension by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) 28 recommended the adoption of ABPM at least once for better risk stratification of hypertension. In contrast to regular dippers, non-dippers and reverse dippers (higher nocturnal blood pressure than daytime) have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and a worse prognosis. In diabetic individuals, non-dipping and morning Blood surges occur around 40-50% of the time 29. blood pressure phenotypes are detected from the discrepancy between ABPM and office blood pressure readings. ABPM is acknowledged as a gold standard for assessing a real hypertensive state. Additionally, ABPM is the sole method for evaluating aberrant circadian blood pressure patterns, such as the nonexistence of a physiological nocturnal blood pressure decline 7, 28. It is well documented that the sturdier predictor of CV and Kidney disease outcomes is ABPM than office blood pressure in individuals with chronic kidney disease 30-32. In chronic kidney disease patients, nondipping status is linked to a Bad prognosis for their renal and CV systems 30. Regardless of the patients nocturnal dipping status, current recommendations support strengthening blood pressure therapy in above-goal ambulatory blood pressure patients. However, the targeted ABPM reading in the nondipping blood pressure profile is poorly documented. Understanding and identifying the risk of this phenotype is necessary before treating them 33. Combining office and out-of-office blood pressure values, such as self-measured home blood pressure or 24-hour ABPM, provided an accurate assessment of the blood pressure status over the past four decades. Its use has become more frequent in clinical and research settings 34. The combined office and home or 24-hour ABPM have indicated four types of hypertension. Sustained normotension (i. e. , normal blood pressure inside and outside the physician or nurses office), sustained hypertension (i. e. , elevated in-office and out-of-office blood pressure), white-coat hypertension, also known as isolated clinic hypertension (i. e. , elevated blood pressure in the office and normal outside the office), and masked hypertension (normal blood pressure inside but elevated outside the clinic office). Significant differences exist between these blood pressure patterns in frequency, demographic and clinical traits, and also in the burden of subclinical organ damage, and the risk of CV complications and death 35, 36. ABPM also allows one to assess day-night blood pressure fluctuation since it provides a considerably greater number of blood pressure readings over 24 hours than office and home blood pressure readings. Most people with normal and High blood pressure readings have a blood pressure circadian rhythm. Nocturnal blood pressure levels are 10% to 20% lower than daytime due to the drop in sympathetic tone and the concurrent rise in vagal activity during sleep. In the past, people with aberrant circadian rhythms (nondippers) have often been defined as having nocturnal blood pressure drops lower than 10% 37, 38. Physical exercise has different effects on both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The systolic blood pressure increases linearly with higher activity levels, but diastolic blood pressure tends to drop. Therefore, dipping categorization might change according to the blood pressure index 39. The majority of ABPM monitors measure blood pressure oscillometrically. The most accurate measurement is made with this method instead of relying on measuring systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Therefore, employing mean arterial Hypertension as the blood pressure indicator for dipping status categorization can be suggested. Secondly, it might be argued that nocturnal should be changed to sleeping in the definition. If a person does not sleep at night, it is unlikely that their blood pressure will decrease.",

    "text": "If a person does not sleep at night, it is unlikely that their blood pressure will decrease. Night shift workers are a Good example, in whom the dipping pattern transforms into a nondipping pattern over the first 24 hours of the night shift. Over the following days, the nondipping pattern gradually returns to a dipping pattern. These participants show a drop in their blood pressure readings during daytime sleep 40. Several combinations of approaches are available to define the sleeping time. Using diary card entries is an uncomplicated strategy. Some people prefer a limited timeframe to describe the evening, such as midnight to 6 AM, eliminating overlapping times when patients may be awake or asleep 41. This maneuver has a negligible impact on non-dippers nighttime dipping proportion as they have a far lower morning blood pressure spike than dippers 42. However, people identified as borderline dippers via other techniques could be identified as nondippers using other techniques such as ABPM. Utilizing activity and posture monitoring, a more contemporary technique, is entirely accurate, particularly when paired with the diary card input technique 39. The binary distribution is a preferred term over a continuous term. We could not identify literature evidence to prove that the 10% cutoff point discriminates more than the other nearby cut-off blood pressure readings. However, the 10% cutoff is arbitrary, but it is simple to apply and seems helpful so far, differentiating dippers from nondipper individuals 43. A nondipping blood pressure patterns clinical use hinges on consistency from one instance to the next. Manning et al. revealed that only 54% of 79 untreated hypertension and normotensive subjects could be reliably categorized as dippers 44. In other research, 170 hypertensives had two ABPMs that were spaced by more than one year, and it was found that at least 40% had altered their dipping status. It should be stated that while the recordings were made when patients were not receiving antihypertensive medication, participants received blood pressure-lowering medicines between the two measures. Reported findings were more encouraging 45. Repeated ABPM was conducted on 65 newly diagnosed untreated hypertension. After the repeated measurements, 12% of the patients nocturnal dipping patterns changed from nondipping to dipping, remaining unaltered in 82% of the patients. Additionally, dipping status seemed more repeatable in trials when daily physical activity was assessed objectively 46. One rationale is that individuals are less inclined to adhere to research procedures when a diary monitors their behavior. Additionally, they probably act similarly in consecutive ABP measures. Alterations in body posture from one night to the next may impact repeatability 47. If the cuff is fastened to the upper arm or the forearm, it may produce a difference of roughly 12 to 14 mmHg while participants sleep on their sides or backs 48. Activity and posture affect the ABPM. Rectifying the arm position effect on blood pressure variations during repeated recordings using these devices is feasible. However, single research reported that correcting variations in body posture overnight did not enhance the repeatability of dipping status 49. Physiology of dipping Blood Hypertension At the start of sleep, recognizable changes occur in autonomic and endocrine activities, including a decrease in sympathetic outflow to the Heart and muscle, vascular bed, and a decrease in renin-angiotensin system activity 50, 51. Parasympathetic activity toward the Heart also rises while sleeping 52. According to previous studies, altering the baroreflex set points to Low blood pressure values causes nocturnal blood pressure drops 51, 53. It is still unclear whether it is an active process, just a sequence of physical inactivity, or sleep-related exposure to outside stimuli.",

    "text": "This area needs further studies to assess these effects. Phenylephrine is an α-adrenoceptor agonist which does not cross the Blood-brain barrier to counteract the natural decline in sympathetic activity due to external stimuli 54. The blood pressure drop that continues for three hours after physical activity refutes the notion that baroreflex mechanisms serve to slow down sudden fluctuations in blood pressure. Resetting was described as an adaptive modification of the baroreceptors function. Due in part to its capacity to reset, early research suggested that the baroreflex arch did not significantly affect long-term control 55. The peripheral baroreflex arch is controlled by a central nervous system-determined set point 56. Because alertness always obscures or continually alters the arterial baroreflex activity, the nocturnal sleep phase is the only possible time that permits the measurement of this centrally directed set point. This concept is consistent with recent animal studies that have brought attention to the notion of a central nerve set point 56. It is interesting to note that Pattoneri et al. observed that patients with prolonged vegetative traumatic brain injury had sympathetic and vagal abnormalities in the modulation of vasomotor tone, resulting in a nondipping pattern 57. These results prove the central neuronal hierarchy that controls blood pressure in humans. Integrating several inputs into this system includes endocrine impacts through body fluid-electrolyte concentration, osmolality effects, and CV Hypertension responses 58, 59. These findings might indicate that a super-ordinated central neural regulation of baroreflex function also occurs in humans. An experiment focused on how sleep affects the efferent part of the sympathetic system activity in the vascular muscle bed, causing vasoconstriction. One potentially implicated route in the circadian blood pressure profile is primarily addressed by maintaining nocturnal blood pressure increased to non-physiological ranges using intravenous vasoconstrictors 58. However, it was impossible to provide comparable precision, especially cardiac baroreflex function 59. Microneurographic techniques used to measure baroreflex gain depict a skewed input-output connection between Blood vessel smooth muscle sympathetic nerve activity. The pharmacological effects of this connection could influence the blood pressure pattern 60. However, this simplification was purposefully made as a scientific pattern delving into significant factors regulating blood pressure while sleeping. Whether the results are general or related to the substances used is unclear. Changing baroreflex set-point of the vascular beds was seen at rest and confirmed across a wide range of blood pressure readings during the infusion of differently-acting drugs (nitroprusside and phenylephrine). It is considerably more plausible that a novel element of nighttime blood pressure physiology that suggests long-lasting consequences throughout the daytime was revealed. However, this precept must be verified in other research within larger populations. The relevance of the rennin-angiotensin system in blood pressure control and permanently resetting the baroreflex has previously been acknowledged 61, 62. Heart rate (heart rate) variability, serum electrolyte concentration, and osmolality did not alter morning blood pressure. However, plasma angiotensin II and renin levels were much lower than the night prior to the phenylephrine infusion. The baroreceptor set point deviated southward due to selective angiotensin-receptor inhibition 61. As a result, one reason for the baroreflex curve change might be the Low angiotensin II levels in the morning 63. It is conceivable that the drop in renin and angiotensin levels reflects the passive effects of nondipping, and it has a non-significant regulatory impact on baroreflex function; however, this hypothesis cannot be proven with the currently available data, hence the need for new research in this domain. Perspectives of Blood Hypertension physiology Nocturnal non-dipping control significance indicates that blood pressure dipping during overnight sleep is a process of active downregulation.",

    "text": "Any violation of this process, such as extrinsic nondipping, is vigorously retaliated against by the body, even causing blood pressure levels to drop the next day without a significant autonomic and sympathetic response imbalance. The research emphasizes the significance of coordinated central neurological systems, which, via baroreflex mechanisms, actively reduce blood pressure during sleep. This presents a fresh viewpoint on the function of sleep-in controlling blood pressure under physiological and pathological circumstances. To clarify the mechanism(s), new studies are required on the mechanism(s) of the physiology of blood pressure changes during daytime and sleeping time. Blood Hypertension variances Disruptions in the blood pressure rhythms increase the risk of diseases associated with hypertension independently of the actual blood pressure readings. However, this technique needs to consider the daily regularity of blood pressure change. Clinical guidelines are being improved to include using ABPM to acquire data over extended periods of activity and rest while doing daily activities 28, 64. This is done in recognition of the fact that the circadian pattern of daily blood pressure is essential information for diagnosing and managing hypertension. blood pressure rhythm is endogenously created without external timing signals and cycles for a full day. It continues to exist even during studies that impose 20or 28-hour cycles of activity, sleep, and eating cycles 65. In healthy people, the daily rhythm of the blood pressure is defined by a morning rise after waking up, which peaks throughout the daytime, followed by a nighttime dip. In 1988, the term nondipper was developed to refer to hypertension patients with a diminished nocturnal decline who also had an elevated risk of stroke 66. Nondipping, now more precisely defined as a nocturnal blood pressure decrease of 10% compared with daily readings, is frequently used to refer to unusually rising blood pressure at rest. Nocturnal hypertension diagnosis is based on absolute blood pressure levels rather than changes from the daytime reading. Referring to the American Hypertension Association (AHA), 2017, blood pressure 110/65 mmHg 6 may be quantitatively reliable 67 but may not always indicate an abnormal endogenous blood pressure pattern. Notably, nighttime hypertension and nondipping blood pressure enhance risk, with individuals with both characteristics showing the poorest profile 68. Various CVDs, such as left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy 69, atherosclerotic plaques 70, congestive Heart failure 71, vascular dementia 64, and myocardial infarction, are all linked to nondipping 72. Furthermore, microalbuminuria indicates an early Kidney involvement in nondipping hypertension 73. Nocturnal blood pressure or nondipping was linked to all causes of mortality and aggregate cardiovascular disease outcomes 72. The most extensive meta-analysis of hypertensive patients research used the ABPM blood pressure measurement method, revealing that nondipping independently predicts CV events 74. The risk of cardiovascular disease is doubled by masked nocturnal hypertension 75. ABPM usage in a primary care setting revealed nocturnal hypertension in 30% of individuals with normal office blood pressure readings 76, suggesting that this kind of masked High blood pressure may be common. Its appearance early in the Diabetes progressive course anticipates the onset of nephropathy and appears in most individuals with chronic kidney disease 14. Significantly, nondipping precedes and forecasts renal disease development 77. A crucial information gap about the cycles of normal blood pressure physiology hampers the therapy for hypertension to improve the circadian blood pressure pattern; however, it is easier said than done. Day-night fluctuations in activity 78 and heart rate 79 are significant contributors, among other variables, to blood pressure dipping-non-dipping patterns. The blood pressure variance types are illustrated in Figure 1. Summary-of-Blood-Hypertension-Variants. Figure 1: Summary of Blood Hypertension Variants.",

Dipping Blood Hypertension Most normal individuals possess a dipping blood pressure pattern in which their nocturnal blood pressure is 10-20% less than their daytime blood pressure. Over the last three decades, dipping patterns in hypertensive patients have been intensively examined. Comparing the overall mortality in hypertensive dippers and nondippers verified that the dippers had a decreased risk of overall mortality, which was reinforced by the lack of heterogeneity across trials. Moreover, comparing the risk of stroke among the two groups demonstrated no significant differences; the same was true for subgroup analysis of ischemic strokes 80. Additionally, the risk of overall mortality and stroke was not substantially different between dippers and nondippers; however, reverse dippers had an increased stroke risk 80. Decreased dipping and nondipping patterns indicate increased CV risk and hypertension-associated organ damage 23, 81, 82. The predictive significance of nondipping, reverse dipping and excessive dipping in CV morbidity and death was verified by a comprehensive meta-analysis of 17, 312 treated and untreated hypertensive people. Results supported that frequent treatment reduces cardiovascular morbidity and death by restoring the natural dipping pattern 74. However, recent studies in untreated hypertensive individuals indicate that most surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, carotid media layer thickness, arterial stiffness, and endothelial dysfunction, are comparable between dippers and non-dippers 83-86. Several clinical and methodological factors may nullify the predictive usefulness of nondipping in untreated hypertension. Such considerations include poor repeatability of the dipping status, the likelihood of very Low daytime blood pressure producing a nondipping phenotype without High values of overnight or 24-hour blood pressure, and the confounding influence of associated morbidities 87. Mechanism of Blood Hypertension dipping during sleep The natural drop in blood pressure during sleep is due to inactivity and sleep. This reduction may be countered by arguing that sedentary lifestyles and Low sleep quality are to blame. It has been hypothesized, for instance, that those with a higher CV event risk are also more likely to be identified as non-dippers because they are less active throughout the day 88. It was suggested that insufficient daily exercise and deprived sleep are to blame for the non-dipping phenomena, although this theory is contested. First, a study comparing dippers and non-dippers finds that their daytime blood pressure is comparable 89. Second, patients who report having High sleep quality in their diaries may also have non-dipping blood pressure 89. Third, non-dipping is associated with various clinical problems that have a nonsignificant effect on daytime activity and sleep quality. Regarding the hemodynamics at play here, overnight systemic vascular resistance is either the same as daytime systemic vascular resistance or is significantly enhanced 49. Decreased heart rate contributes to lower cardiac output at night, whereas stroke volume is unaffected 49. Differences in cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance between day and night have been examined in several studies 49, 76, 90. There seems to be a lack of consistency in research results. Thus, a lack of a nighttime decline in blood pressure might be due to a reduced nocturnal reduction in cardiac output, an exaggerated change in systemic peripheral resistance, or both. The difference between night and day readings of blood pressure is primarily because changes in posture and daily activities highly impact the diurnal variations in cardiac output and peripheral resistance 39. The alteration in systemic activity of the autonomic nervous system during sleep is primarily due to a decrease in parameters such as sympathetic and increased parasympathetic activities, heart rate and cardiac output.",

    "text": "When autonomic dysfunction occurs, blood pressure does not drop as it should during sleep and may even rise throughout the night (nocturnal hypertension) 91: concomitantly, leading to conceding of the SNS, and much Blood pools in the legs and feet when the body is upright. Due to diminished renal perfusion caused by the upright position during the day, the kidneys retain fluid throughout the day. Due to decreased autonomic function, the baroreflex cannot prevent an increased stroke volume, cardiac output, and blood pressure caused by lying flat. The pathophysiology of non-dipping may include excessive extracellular fluid due to the associated renal dysfunction, and increased aldosterone and cortisol hormones are commonly seen in patients with this condition. Studies showed that the nondipping blood pressure might be transformed into a dipping blood pressure profile in Sodium-sensitive hypertensives by following a Sodium-restricted diet or diuretics and in diabetics using Thiazolidinediones 92. Hence, the underlying mechanisms of the blood pressure dipping phenomenon are likely due to the decreased physiological, physical, and mental activities. Nondipping Blood Hypertension Although it is debatable, there is mounting evidence that individuals with essential hypertension and nondipping blood pressure probably have more risk of target organ damage 93. A nondipping blood pressure profile is distinguished by a blood pressure decrease of 10% at night, associated with the rapid deterioration in renal function in adulthood. The nondipping blood pressure pattern is common in children. However, in a cohort study of children with chronic kidney disease, Bakhoum et al. observed that nondipping is not linked to end-stage renal disease, a drop in estimated glomerular filtration rate, or a change in proteinuria level 90. The nondipping blood pressure profile links with a higher rate of CV events and target organ damage. However, there are also concerns about how well ABPM measures the dipping status. Furthermore, nondipping has yet to be given a precise definition. A nondipping profile may have anomalies in extracellular volume and vascular resistance modulation as its pathophysiological mechanism(s). Additionally, variations in day and nighttime activities, sleep quality, and body positioning when sleeping are also involved. The ABPM may define the physiological status, assess the efficacy of the antihypertensive medication, and detect white-coat hypertension, masked hypertension, and uncontrolled masked hypertension. ABPM seems more reliable in predicting prognosis and death than clinical measures 27. Most people have significantly lower blood pressure at night. A decrease in the typical nocturnal drop should be considered abnormal 94. Of this abnormality, clinical importance is related to its close association with hypertensive organ damage, its elevated risk for subsequent CV events, and its correlation with clinical conditions like some secondary forms of hypertension, renal impairment, and disturbances of the autonomic nervous system 95. Notably, a nondipping profile could be advantageous in certain situations. For instance, a medically induced nocturnal blood pressure reduction may cause cerebral hypoperfusion in nondipping individuals who already have a compromised cerebral perfusion 96. A pharmacologically induced reversible non-dipper to a dipper profile may be predicted to reduce CV risk; however, to prove this, further research is required. Mechanism of nondipping Blood Hypertension The loss of the Kidneys ability to eliminate Sodium during the daytime contributes to a diminished nocturnal blood pressure reduction 97. Nocturnal nondipping blood pressure profiles link strongly to decreased Sodium loss during daytime and the rise in nocturnal blood pressure via the Hypertension-natriuresis pathway, most likely a compensatory mechanism to enhance salt excretion and preserve Sodium balance 98. Intervention studies indicated that a dipping pattern is restored following salt restriction or diuretic administration, supporting the Sodium function in controlling circadian blood pressure rhythm 99.",

    "text": "Normal sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate is a significant regulator of salt balance; a decrease in the normal overnight blood pressure fall often accompanies a decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate. The circulating serum levels of cystatin C are less influenced by age, sex, and muscle mass; therefore, cystatin C is more sensitive than serum Creatinine to assess the estimated glomerular filtration rate. Serum cystatin C concentration is substantially higher in essential hypertension patients with reversed dipping blood pressure profiles than those with dipping patterns 100. Relevance of nondipping Blood Hypertension to end-organ damage Research shows that non-dippers have more pronounced cardiac and extracardiac organ damage than individuals who maintain their nightly blood pressure 101. As compared to the dippers, the non-dippers have significantly higher rates of left ventricular hypertrophy, increased thickness of carotid intima and media, microalbuminuria, and cerebrovascular disorders 102. Significantly, a nondipping blood pressure profile links with more severe target organ damage and is an early predictor of CV events in hypertensive and normotensive people 103. Also, it is well known that a blood pressure pattern in which the blood pressure never drops is linked to diminished renal function 95, 104. In contrast, little data suggests that this pattern also increases the development of renal impairment 105. Therefore, this area needs further research to assess the pathophysiology of the dipping-non-dipping blood pressure pattern, the pathogenesis of the damage caused and its consequent long-term effects on the end-organs. Reverse dipping Blood Hypertension Compared with the daytime readings, reverse or inverted dipping is defined by unaltered or even higher nocturnal blood pressure. Reverse or inverted dipping is a severe, not uncommon, disruption in the circadian blood pressure rhythm. It is often seen as a particularly dangerous blood pressure phenotype 101. It is frequently recognized in hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and sleep apnea syndrome. The reversed dipping blood pressure profile is common in sustained hypertension and is thought to be mainly due to increased sympathetic tone during sleeping. Augmented sympathetic tone increases total vascular resistance, heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output, increasing blood pressure and reversing the dipping blood pressure profile 106. The left ventricular mass index in chronic kidney disease was considerably higher in reverse dippers than in non-dippers and dippers 107. In chronic kidney disease, the left ventricular mass index was not substantially greater among reverse dippers than dippers, nondippers, or severe dippers 108. Among several ambulatory day/night blood pressure profiles, the African American Study of Kidney Disease and hypertension Study (Clinical Trial) (AASK Trial) reported slight variations in left ventricular hypertrophy prevalence 109. Young individuals with a less marked or nonexistent nocturnal blood pressure drop at the first screening had the highest probability of developing coronary calcification 10 to 15 years later 110. A study has established a substantial link between reversed blood pressure dipping profile and increased Urine Protein excretion 111. Proteinuria was 66% higher in reverse dippers than in dippers and nearly four times higher than in severe dippers. Other investigations failed to identify statistically significant differences in proteinuria, defined as continuous or binary variables, between reverse dipper chronic kidney disease patients and nondipper and dipper patients 112. The risk of end-stage renal disease and CV events related to reverse dipping blood pressure was assessed in 1024 patients. Patients with reversed blood pressure exhibited higher renal and CV events rates than patients with maintained circadian blood pressure rhythm, regardless of 24-hour systolic blood pressure values 111, 113. The increased mortality risk identified among patients with reversible blood pressure was probably due to CV events 101.",

    "text": "The increased mortality risk identified among patients with reversible blood pressure was probably due to CV events 101. In a survey of elderly patients without major CV diseases or other existing morbidities at baseline conducted in a primary care practice in Belgium, reverse blood pressure had prognostic significance in univariable analyses; however, it had lost its predictive value after tuning for confounders, including 24-hour blood pressure 114. Another study of hypertensive diabetic patients at High risk for CVDs revealed that reverse blood pressure status was independently correlated with higher rates of the composite outcome, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and CV events, during a follow-up period of 2. 6 years 115. The research evaluated the advantages of improving overnight blood pressure regulation 116. Researchers investigated if the nighttime administration of one or more blood pressure-lowering medications may regulate blood pressure and minimize CV risk. After a follow-up of 5. 6 years, individuals using one or more blood pressure-lowering medications at bedtime had a lower overnight blood pressure and a decreased incidence of nondipping/reversed dipping blood pressure profile than patients taking all medications in the morning. Significantly, better nocturnal blood pressure management was related to a significant reduction (60%) in the relative risk of CV events. It should be emphasized, however, that information on therapies intended to restore the blood pressure circadian rhythm still needs to be improved and has been supplied by just a few research projects. The High blood pressure readings in reversed dipping are considered dangerous compared to the increased daytime blood pressure values 101. Further research is therefore required on the primary traits, clinical implications, and prognostic implications of reverse dipping and preserving dipping patterns. Reporters showed that reversed dipping blood pressure profiles were more prevalent in the elderly, smokers, males, and a history of cardiovascular disease 117. Pressioni Arteriose Monitorate E Loro Associazioni (PAMELA) study revealed a similar prevalence 118. Four European studies reported in a Belgian ABPM database that about 11% of the population had an inverted blood pressure profile 119. Recent research on untreated essential hypertension patients (26% of whom had type 2 diabetes mellitus) revealed that, on average, nocturnal systolic blood pressure values were higher than daytime values in almost one-fourth of patients (24%) 120. It was learned that older age, type 2 Diabetes, higher Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations were related to an inverted dipping blood pressure pattern. It was observed that the greatest incidence of reversed dipping blood pressure profile (36%) was in treated patients with essential hypertension 98. In Japanese research, reverse sinking blood pressure prevalence was roughly 9% 121. In the AASK trial, the reverse dipping hypertension pattern was 39%, mostly due to the older age of the individuals included in the study (60 years) 109. The Chronic Kidney Disease Japan Cohort research revealed that 15. 5% of chronic kidney disease patients had elevated nighttime blood pressure 122. A greater prevalence of High blood pressure has been observed in patients with stages 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease compared to stage 3 and in patients with Diabetes compared to non-Diabetes. About 13% of those candidates were reverse dippers; they also had more moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea incidence than other groups (13. 5 vs. 9. 0 vs. 7. 5% in non-dippers and dippers, respectively) 123. This development was associated with an increase in blood pressure dippers 124. Lastly, it is unknown if and to what degree the reverse dipper blood pressure pattern constitutes a persistent clinical feature across time and whether it will cause persistent hypertension. Hence, additional research is required to further study these issues.",

White coat hypertension Usually, the measurement of blood pressure in a healthcare facility leads to higher readings for people who are generally not used to the place and/or medical professionals. Around 10-30% of patients with High blood pressure values are inappropriately diagnosed with hypertension. Although they do not have hypertension, they have what is known as white coat hypertension (WCHTN). The overall prevalence of WCHTN is about 10-15% in the general population and reported in about 30% in High blood pressure readings at the clinic 125, 126. The reported prevalence of WCHTN differs according to the criteria for diagnosing this type of hypertension. For instance, Zhu et al. reported a WCHTN in 5. 1% of the Chinese population 127. In a study, using the criteria of daytime, 24-h, or all ambulatory periods, the prevalence of WCHTN in the untreated group was found to be 41. 3%, 35. 2%, and 26. 1%, respectively. In the treated group, the prevalence figures were 45. 8% (daytime), 38. 9% (24-h), and 27. 2% (all ambulatory periods) - in all three categories of respective criteria 128. This type of hypertension is diagnosed or excluded using ABPM. WCHTN may cause people whose blood pressure is genuinely normal to be misclassified when clinic-blood pressure readings are used. Yet, there are still debates regarding WCHTN and its significance 129-131. Thomas Pickering has introduced the term white-coat hypertension, describing people who did not take medicine for their High blood pressure. These people have High office blood pressure readings, but their blood pressure readings are normal when monitored by the ABPM method. These people would have a Low risk of CV events 132. The recent European guidelines suggest a different definition of WCHTN, which includes people with systolic/diastolic blood pressure readings of 140/90 mmHg in the clinic and 24-hour ABPM of 130/80 mmHg 133. Current recommendations do not advise therapy; nevertheless, a new study indicates that this condition may still signify that overt hypertension may develop 134. Reported evidence claims harmful consequences from inappropriate antihypertensive medication if WCHTN patients have out-of-office blood pressure readings at or below the target blood pressure 135, 136. However, in patients aged 80 years, WCHTN treatment is advisable to reduce CV and neurovascular events 137. Instead, patients should keep up with their extensive lifestyle changes and efforts to lower their CV risk by controlling dyslipidemia and Diabetes, which are usually present simultaneously. American College of Cardiology (ACC) and AHA guidelines describe WCHTN as an office blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg but 160/100 mmHg, as well as a daytime blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg on ABPM or home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) 6. Conversely, European recommendations use office blood pressure threshold levels of 140/90 mmHg 28. In most known research, the cutoff values are 140/90 mmHg for office blood pressure and 135/85 mmHg for out-of-office blood pressure. Guidelines advise using ABPM or HBPM for out-of-office blood pressure monitoring to diagnose doubtful HTNs, including identifying white-coat HTNs. Those with suspected WCHTN should have the diagnosis verified within 3-6 months after their initial High blood pressure reading, advisably by the ABPM method. Also, they should have ABPM or HBPM every year to see if persistent High blood pressure is developing 133. On the other hand, the Canadian diagnostic algorithm advises doing HBPM, or ABPM, after the first visit High blood pressure record to recognize WCHTN patients as early as possible 138. Automated self-office blood pressure recording may reduce the late diagnosis of WCHTN and the number of people who require long hours of blood pressure measurements 138.",

    "text": "One way to focus on out-of-office blood pressure evaluation is to examine how blood pressure readings change for one clinic visit. This opinion was reported as a great method to predict differences between blood pressure results in the clinic and at home 139. This would allow doctors to advise patients suspected of having WCHTN to use out-of-office methods more frequently. When used in combination with ABPM rather than in place of it, HBPM may be most helpful for identifying WCHTN because of its High specificity; however, it has poor sensitivity for WCHTN diagnosis 140. A deep breathing test might be used as another strategy to target or minimize the usage of outside blood pressure monitoring. In a clinical study, patients are unlikely to have WCHTN identified using ABPM if their systolic blood pressure fell by 15% or less following 30 seconds of deep breathing 141. Although the ABPM or HBPM recording may increase the service cost, it can effectively reduce the long-term treatment costs when the office blood pressure reading is doubtful 142. A model based on trial data predicted medical cost savings of ultrasound 1. 56 million per 1000 patients over five years with HBPM included in the diagnosis of hypertension 143. According to a second examination of the same data, the widespread use of HBPM might lower Japans medical expenses associated with hypertension by ultrasound 9. 3 million 144. Pathogenesis of albuminuria in white coat hypertension In recent years, the clinical pathogenicity of WCHTN itself has been demonstrated 145; however, the mechanism by which WCHTN induces an increase in CV events remains unexplained 35, 146. In contrast, several potential processes may explain why WCHTN was related to albuminuria. WCHTN was characterized by High blood pressure readings in the doctors office, implying that WCHTN patients had supersensitive sympathetic nerve activity. As evaluated by microneurography 147, individuals with WCHTN showed considerably more SNS activity than normotensive individuals 148. Patients with WCHTN showed a tachycardia to bradycardia variability ratio than those with normotensive. The WCHTN groups blood pressure response to mental stress was significantly larger than the normotensive 149. In the first mechanism, it was considered that this increased sympathetic activity was the main risk factor for cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and mortality 150, 151, suggesting that this sympathetic system hypersensitivity may cause WCHTN. According to research by Ohasama, patients with WCHTN often suffer from metabolic syndromes 152. It is also thought that metabolic syndromes due to the caused endothelial dysfunction may lead to albuminuria, increasing cardiovascular disease and death. A third possible mechanism of albuminuria in WCHTN is that these individuals are more likely to acquire secondary hypertension than those with normal blood pressure 153. Sustained hypertension is a chief risk factor for cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and albumin in the Urine. Lastly, it is plausible that WCHTN directly causes albuminuria, but no corroborating data. Moreover, whether albuminuria in WCHTN indicates development and chronic kidney disease advancement remains to be determined. Further research is required to assess the significance of albuminuria in WCHTN patients as a predictor for renal damage. Masked hypertension Since Thomas Pickering in 2002 announced the term masked hypertension, it gained widespread attention 154. The frequency of masked hypertension ranges between 8-20% in untreated adults and almost 61% in treated adults 155, 156. When the blood pressure readings are normal in a health service or clinic facility, but blood pressure readings are High by ABPM or HBPM, then masked hypertension should be considered as a diagnosis.",

    "text": "There is a need to encourage the usage of ABPM or home blood pressure measuring devices when blood pressure readings are in the normal range inside the clinic, but blood pressure readings are High outside. However, incidental blood pressure measurements may occasionally reveal this condition, and an explanation is needed when masked hypertension is discovered during sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea can cause High systolic BPs, and essential hypertension can cause gradually increasing pressures, altering the blood pressure dipping pattern. The nighttime drop in blood pressure can disappear due to dreaming, which may cause nighttime narrow systolic hypertension peaks. Approximately 20% of those missed individuals who go untreated may develop masked hypertension. Masked hypertension increases carotid atherosclerosis risk and the LV muscle mass index compared with normotensive persons 157. A Japanese study reported a decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate in masked hypertension patients 158. Due to these reported CV and renal complications, it was recommended to treat masked hypertension 159. Antihypertensive drugs should be used to treat this type of hypertension since they may increase hypertension complications risks. Sustained (persistent) hypertension A subject with High blood pressure readings both during home monitoring and at health facilities is labeled as having sustained hypertension, which is highly linked to an increased risk of renal and cardiac damage, necessitating early anti-hypertension therapy initiation. Kidney and Blood Hypertension variation Although some researchers have indicated that nocturnal blood pressure predicts cardiovascular disease and death 160, others did not support this 161. The loss of a normal drop in nocturnal blood pressure in hypertensive patients is linked with target organ dysfunction such as the left ventricle and kidneys 69, microalbuminuria 162, cerebrovascular 163, and CV events 164. Few studies in normotensive patients focused on Urine albumin excretion, examining the association between the diurnal rhythm of blood pressure and renal outcomes. Previous research in normotensive people revealed a weak correlation between the LV mass index and dipping blood pressure profile 165 but not with Urine albumin excretion 166. Borrelli et al. concluded that High systolic blood pressure recorded by ABPM or loss of nocturnal blood pressure dipping is linked to higher rates of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease progression, especially in chronic kidney disease patients 33. The nondipping blood pressure profile is more common in chronic kidney disease patients due to increased SNS activity 167; the non-dipper profile raises the risk of renal disease 77. The loss of Kidney function and the prediction factors and measures still need to be clarified through further studies. The currently available data revealed no discernible difference in Urine Protein content between nondippers and dippers with Low blood pressure. Previous research on progressive reduction in the estimated glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate) showed that nighttime blood pressure was the best indicator of renal disease development 113. In a recent study reported in 1, 042 hypertensive patients after almost six years, the estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased by -0. 23 to -0. 20 milliliters per minute/year, as the decline in the rates of nighttime systolic, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial Hypertension raised by 1% (P 0. 001). Although the average nighttime blood pressure in the nondipper Low blood pressure group was more significant than in the dipper Low blood pressure group, the estimated glomerular filtration rate drop rate was not different among these groups. The recent findings did not confirm an exact figure for this; however, they thought that the nocturnal blood pressure threshold is not a significant factor for chronic kidney disease development.",

    "text": "They concluded that nighttime blood pressure could be utilized as a Kidney injury marker in hypertension patients 168. Due to a need for more robust reported data, it is still being determined whether reversing non-dipper to dipper blood pressure patterns by blood pressure-lowering agents to potentiate renoprotective effects is significantly effective. Many clinical studies have shown that the normalization of blood pressures diurnal rhythm by anti-hypertensives improves proteinuria in early diabetic nephropathy 113 and lowers CV events risk 169. Crespo et al. demonstrated that bedtime hypertension therapy for chronic kidney disease patients decreased the mean nighttime blood pressure and the proportion of non-dippers 170. Kado et al. reported that even though it is an observational result, switching normotensive patients blood pressure profile from a nondipper to a dipper may not be advantageous for preventing the course of Kidney disease progression 171. Another study reported that ABPM provides extra information for Kidney and CV outcomes in hypertensive chronic kidney disease prediction than multiple clinic blood pressure measures 32. Because ABPM itself interrupts the sleeping state and lowers daytime activity, which results in greater nocturnal blood pressure and lowers daytime blood pressure than typical, the producibility of ABPM may sometimes be limited. Even at intervals of many weeks, previous research revealed that some people had a distinct circadian blood pressure profile in serial ABPM 71. The 48-hour ABPM may be more accurate in representing the blood pressure profile 172, although it is less practical for routine clinical use. The long-term effect of blood pressure control on the drop in the estimated glomerular filtration rate is also unknown since no studies for evaluation of blood pressure control used ABPM for blood pressure readings during the 48-hour ABPM-observational period was observed. A clinical review concluded a significant correlation between the baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate and annual estimated glomerular filtration rate drop during blood pressure-reduction therapy. Additionally, in the same review, they reported that the 20% reduction of the estimated glomerular filtration rate following blood pressure reduction might be accepted and probably extended to 46% depending upon the reduction achieved 173. The likelihood of developing Kidney disease is more in nondipper than the dipper-hypertensive-chronic kidney disease patients. Kado et al. reported that normotensive nondipping chronic kidney disease patients have a lesser risk of rapid estimated glomerular filtration rate drop 166. Additionally, a previous cohort analysis showed that an elevated risk of end-stage renal disease was linked to an estimated glomerular filtration rate drop for a one-year follow-up 174. These findings imply that maintaining estimated glomerular filtration rate depends more on controlling blood pressure than maintaining its circadian rhythm. Clarifying the impact of the diurnal regularity of blood pressure on renal disease prognosis in normotensives, certain research parameters would be needed for High-powered research such as a higher number of research participants, inclusive population, and a long observation time. Borrelli et al. concluded that High systolic blood pressure measured by ABPM or nocturnal blood pressure dipping loss is linked to higher cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease progression rates, especially in chronic kidney disease patients 33. A non-dipping blood pressure profile is more common in chronic kidney disease patients 175; the non-dipper profile raises the risk of renal disease 167. Nevertheless, it takes a great deal of effort to normalize both the actual blood pressure value and the blood pressure rhythm throughout the day. Few studies focused on the Urine albumin excretion while examining the association between renal outcomes and blood pressure rhythm in normotensive patients.",

A recent study conducted on adolescents found that there was no conclusive evidence to suggest a link between night-time blood pressure dipping and cardiac structure changes. However, it was reported that measuring blood pressure variability could be helpful in assessing the risk of CV remodeling, even in adolescents with blood pressure within the physiological range 176. The loss of Kidney function still needs to be clarified and studied further. The current data revealed no discernible difference in Protein Urine content between non-dippers and dippers with Low blood pressure.

The 48-hour-ABPM may more accurately represent the blood pressure profile 172, although it is less practical for routine clinical use. The Low incidence of individuals who exhibit dipping blood pressure patterns is another drawback, possibly due to the small sample size that impacted the significance of blood pressure variations in the reported data. Furthermore, even though the nondipping profile was not a factor for the development of Kidney disease in normotensive individuals, there is a precise value of the blood pressure risk threshold. Prospective interventional research with several ABPM tests is required to set a target blood pressure. Uncertainty persists on the best time to take blood pressure readings that accurately represent the declining blood pressure trend and the average readings day and night.",

    "text": "Previous research showed that self-home blood pressure recording is an alternate tool for forecasting end-organ damage and reasonably correlating with ABPM, and both are superior to office blood pressure monitoring 9. Kado et al. reported that a nondipping blood pressure profile in normotensive chronic kidney disease patients does not indicate a risk for a quick fall in estimated glomerular filtration rate 166. The nondipping blood pressure profile increases the likelihood of developing Kidney disease in hypertensive chronic kidney disease patients more than in dipping blood pressure. Additionally, a prior community-based cohort analysis showed that an elevated risk of end-stage renal disease was linked to an estimated glomerular filtration rate drop for a one-year follow-up 174. These findings infer that maintaining estimated glomerular filtration rate depends more on controlling blood pressure than maintaining its circadian rhythm. More participants and a long observation time are necessary to assess the impact of the diurnal regularity of blood pressure on the renal disease prognosis in normotensives. Conclusions Ambulatory Blood Hypertension monitoring has impacted Blood Hypertension classification and encouraged research on hypertension patterns, effects, and types. Physical activity, subjective sleep quality, and consecutive day recordings improve the reproducibility of Blood Hypertension measurement. Volume-related variables may play a role in abnormal Blood Hypertension patterns. Nondipping hypertension is linked to salt sensitivity, renal function impairment, Sodium retention, and mineralocorticoid-induced hypertension; however, further studies are required to certain the relationship. Reversing the blood pressure dipping pattern may have poor CV prognostic effects, although there is conflicting evidence; hence, more research is needed on treatment approaches that restore circadian blood pressure rhythms and the long-term effect of circadian rhythms restoration.
