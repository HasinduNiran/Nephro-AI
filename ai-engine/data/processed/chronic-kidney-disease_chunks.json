Langan, MD, St. Lukes Family Medicine ResidencySacred Heart, Allentown, Pennsylvania; Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) affects approximately 15% of the U. S. population, and many people are unaware of their diagnosis. Screening may be considered for patients with cardiovascular disease, Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, age 60 years and older, family history of Kidney disease, previous acute Kidney injury, or preeclampsia. Diagnosis and staging of chronic kidney disease are based on estimated glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate), excessive urinary albumin excretion, or evidence of Kidney parenchymal damage lasting more than three months. estimated glomerular filtration rate should be determined using the chronic kidney disease-EPI Creatinine equation without the race variable. Risk calculators are available to estimate the risk of progression to end-stage renal disease. When possible, serum cystatin C should be measured to confirm estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients with chronic kidney disease. Blood Hypertension should be maintained at less than 140/90 mm Hg, with a systolic Blood Hypertension target of 120 mm Hg or less for patients tolerant of therapy, using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and metformin should be considered in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 Diabetes who have not reached their glycemic goal. Intravenous iodinated contrast media temporarily reduces estimated glomerular filtration rate and should be avoided in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. Interdisciplinary management of patients with chronic kidney disease is important for reducing morbidity and mortality, and patients at High risk of progression to end-stage renal disease should be referred to a nephrologist.
