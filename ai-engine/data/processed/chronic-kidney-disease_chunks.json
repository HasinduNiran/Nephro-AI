Proteinuria without diabetes A 17 year old man attends your surgery with a fever and sore throat As part of your clinical assessment you perform a urine diptest, which shows protein but no leucocytes or nitrites His estimated glomerular filtration rate is normal How should you proceed? 4. haematuria in a patient aged ≥60 years A 61 year old woman with hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, and a 40 pack year history of smoking attends your surgery. She has an estimated glomerular filtration rate reported as 45 milliliters per minute/1. 73m2. A urine diptest reveals blood How should you proceed Urological investigations reveal no urinary tract abnormality. Her most recent estimated glomerular filtration rate result is 43 milliliters per minute/1. 73m2. Should she be referred to a nephrologist? 5. Haematuria in a young patient A 24 year old woman presents with a several month history of arthralgia and mouth ulcers. You perform a urine diptest which reveals blood and protein How should you proceed? 6. Hypertension and chronic kidney disease A 62 year old woman has a new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. She is found to be hypertensive with a blood pressure of 158/95. She has an albumin-creatinine ratio of 32 magnesium/mmol. She is commenced on ramipril at 2. 5 magnesium. Her baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate is 55 milliliters per minute/1. 73m2 You check her kidney function one week later Her estimated glomerular filtration rate is now 46 milliliters per minute/1. 73m2 How should you proceed? 7. Renal ultrasound scan A 70 year old South Asian woman has an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 45 milliliters per minute/1. 73m2, which is stable. She complains of non-specific abdominal pain and intermittent loin tenderness. You decide to get an ultrasound of her abdomen, which is reported as showing one simple cyst on the left kidney and two on the right kidney. There is no known family history of polycystic kidney disease Does this ultrasound require follow-up 9. Anaemia and chronic kidney disease A 69 year old Caucasian woman with stage 3b chronic kidney disease has a haemoglobin level of 95 g/l. What should you do? 10. Statins and Anti-platelets in chronic kidney disease A 55 year old man has an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 52 milliliters per minute/1. 73m2 which is stable. He is a lifelong smoker. He is not known to have cardiovascular disease. Should he be prescribed a statin and aspirin? 11. hyperkalemia A 75 year old man with stage 4 chronic kidney disease secondary to diabetes has a check estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15 and a potassium of 6. 1. His baseline renal function is glomerular filtration rate of 25. He tells you he has been generally unwell over the last few days with rigors and a productive cough and has not been eating and drinking very much His medication includes irbesartan 300mg OD and furosemide 40mg BD, aspirin 75mg and Novomix 30 insulin 25 units morning and evening He looks dehydrated and pale, with a blood pressure of 100/60 and temperature of 35. 1.
