    "text": "GENERAL PATHOLOGY OF THE Kidney A/Professor John Finnie University Veterinarian, Office of the Deputy ViceChancellor (Research) University of Adelaide The kidneys: A pair of handy tea strainers The following extract from the ABCs Body Programme, written by Dr Earle Hackett, a former haematologist at the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science in Adelaide, neatly outlines the principal functions of the Kidney and why it is vulnerable to damage Renal characteristics It is at the butchers that most people get a butchers at a pair of kidneys. There is one very noticeable thing about them. The arteries and veins entering and leaving appear to be very large . . almost a quarter of the circulating Blood goes through the kidneys each time around Everyone knows from experience that if you Drink liquid, however turbid or flavoured or mixed, before long some clear straw-coloured pee will flush out at your other end. Some kind of filtering is going on. The connecting channel is the bloodstream. Water is absorbed into the Blood from the gut and removed from the bloodstream by the Kidney. So what the Kidney is filtering is not tea, or beer, but Blood. Urine is a concentrated filtrate of the Blood Renal characteristics The main artery that enters each Kidney promptly branches and re-branches until it has finally divided into about a million small Blood vessels, tangled like a ball of thread, termed a glomerulus (from glomus, a Roman ladys ball of thread) Each glomerulus hangs like a nipple into a small cellular receiving funnel that is closed around it like a babys lips. Each of these funnels has a draining outlet that connects up with its million fellows through collecting tubules to form the ureter that carries pee to the bladder Renal characteristics The fine walls of the very small Blood vessels that form the glomerulus are leaky. They leak like sieves. They have sieve holes that only hold back large molecules in the Blood like plasma proteins, but let everything else through. There are also a few smaller Protein molecules that the sieve would not retain were it not for electrostatic attractions But everything else pours out from the Blood through the little sieve holes into the collecting funnels Water (gallons of it), salt, Glucose, amino acids, bicarbonate, Potassium, calcium, phosphates, and urea everything small and soluble. The only things that are held back are those that are differentially kept in the Blood by being specifically carried on large, special Blood plasma molecules into which they are temporally slotted. If this was all, the kidneys would be no more than Blood strainers Renal characteristics But you need most of the Water and the sugars and salt and so on that is being filtered out at an enormous rate. The Blood vessel still continues in the Kidney after it leaves the glomerulus It continues beside the cell walls of the urinary tubule in which the watery filtrate is now flowing. The Blood Hypertension in that Blood vessel is now slacker.",

    "text": "The Blood Hypertension in that Blood vessel is now slacker. The effect is that much of the Water and Glucose and salt in the filtrate moves back by osmosis across the tube wall into the Blood again The rest of the urinary collecting tubes are quite lengthy, are lined by active cells that use energy to return to the Blood the rest of the Glucose, salts and amino acids and so on that the body does not want to lose So by this combined mechanism of heavy filtration followed by first passive and then specific chemical reabsorption, the Kidney eventually allows a concentrate of about 2 litres to run out as pee every 24 hours. Therefore, out of all that filtering of 200 litres from the Blood, 198 litres has been absorbed back into the Blood again Renal characteristics The Kidney is cleansing the soluble components of the house of the body by constantly flinging everything out, then reorganising and bringing back in again only the familiar and the useful, and leaving the rest to leak away as unwanted sewerage However, where the kidneys are vulnerable is where they are exceptional; which is where they handle so much Blood and where they concentrate things. For example, some mildly harmful component that is in the circulation and damages small Blood vessels could have heavy local effects in the Kidney. So also might a small amount of a cell poison that could have become extra active when concentrated in the Kidney tubules Renal functions Central organ involved in maintenance of a constant extracellular environment in the body Vital homeostatic functions are: Excretion of waste products Maintenance of normal concentrations of salt and Water in the body Regulation of acid-base balance Production of hormones (erythropoietin, renin, prostaglandins) Metabolism of vitamin D to its active form Essential requirements for normal renal function Adequate perfusion with Blood (Hypertension 60mmHg) renal Blood flow is High (up to 25% of cardiac output) and decreased Blood flow causes injury, especially to the cortex. It is only reduced to preserve circulation to Heart and brain Adequate functional renal tissue Normal elimination of Urine Renal functions Water and salt are the most important constituents of body fluids and need to be conserved Large quantities of metabolites also need to be excreted (nitrogenous wastes and a multitude of other organic and inorganic substances) Excretion of wastes and conservation of Water requires a concentrating mechanism capable of raising the osmotic Hypertension of Urine above that of Blood Renal Blood flow remains constant to ensure a stable glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate) Renal functions The glomerulus produces an ultrafiltrate due to High capillary hydrostatic Hypertension and Low hydrostatic Hypertension in Bowmans space and difference in osmotic Hypertension.",

A High glomerular filtration rate initiates the opposite response Macula densa secretes prostaglandin E2, causing renin release from afferent arteriole juxtaglomerular cells, which acts on angiotensinogen (produced by Liver) to generate angiotensin I which, in turn, is cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor Angiotensin II also initiates (1) adrenocortical release of aldosterone, which increases resorption of sodium from distal tubules and collecting ducts, resulting in Water retention and (2) secretion of ADH by the posterior pituitary, which increases Water resorption (via aquaporin channels) in collecting ducts Glomerulus Vascular and epithelial structure designed for the ultrafiltration of plasma Visceral epithelium (podocytes) covers the abluminal surface of glomerular capillaries, while parietal epithelium lines basement membrane of Bowmans capsule Arterioles enter and leave the glomerulus at vascular pole and Urine enters proximal convoluted tubule at urinary pole Glomerular filtration membrane consists of 3 layers Fenestrated capillary endothelium Glomerular basement membrane (GBM), a complex, porous meshwork and sizeand charge-dependent barrier, produced by podocytes and endothelium Podocytes, which have complex interdigitating trabeculae whose foot processes (pedicels) are embedded in GBM.",
