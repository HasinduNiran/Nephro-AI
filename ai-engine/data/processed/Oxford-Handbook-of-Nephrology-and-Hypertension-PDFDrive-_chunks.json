Chronic Kidney Disease, a fl edgling classifi cation at the time, is now well established internationally and, more recently, acute renal failure has emerged from a comparable makeover as Acute Kidney Injury. Although not without detractors, these re-imaginations have helped to raise general awareness of Kidney disease and provided a welcome platform from which nephrologists have re-engaged with colleagues in both primary and secondary care. International efforts to produce consensus guidelines (albeit from disappointingly thin evidence) must also be applauded. However, whilst we may inexplicably struggle to complete suffi cient RCTs of Good quality, we remain admirable innovators of clinical services. It is a great privilege to be part of a global renal community best characterized by its restlessness to do things better. Youll fi nd a little more depth to the information in this edition, although this remains balanced with the more pragmatic advice that was so well received last time out. With unlimited knowledge just a few keyboard strokes away, it seemed even more important to bring essential information to the fore and present it in as palatable and practical a way as possible. We hope the additional detail will also prove useful during preparation for postgraduate examinations and assessments. This Handbook now sits in a larger family, having been joined by the excellent Oxford Specialist Handbooks of Renal Transplantation and Paediatric Nephrology. Along with the well-established O xford Handbook of Dialysis and the newer O xford Desktop Reference of Nephrology, we believe these represent a formidable resource across our entire specialty. The fi rst edition was the idea of a few enthusiastic London trainees, cultivated through animated caffeine-fuelled discussions as their lab experiments simmered nearby. Whilst still enthusiastic (on the whole), said trainees are now undeniably greyer, balder, rounder and grumpier (well let those of you who know ultrasound decide which adjective fi ts each of ultrasound best) and it has inevitably proved challenging to complete this new version around the demands of busy professional and personal lives. We are therefore extremely grateful to all our contributors as well as to OUP for (almost) being as patient as our families.",

    "text": "But, ultimately, it is the support and Good humour of the latter that has really allowed ultrasound to complete the text you are about to read. It had always been our intention to create a Handbook that makes the practice of renal medicine a little easier and a lot more enjoyable. And on that thought, we offer this new edition to you as meagre thanks for the wonderful fortune that brought our Good friend and colleague Shaun Summers, all too briefl y, into our lives. SS sodium, London, 2013 vii Preface to the fi rst edition The ability to recognize and understand renal disease and hypertension is an important part of practice in almost any area of medicine. Acute renal failure, often preventable, occurs in up to 7% of all hospital admissions and remains responsible for much morbidity and mortality. The recent reclassifi cation of chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) has exposed the scale of a serious public health issue, relevant to all medical practitioners both in primary and secondary care. Furthermore, irrespective of specialist interest, regular clinical contact with patients who are Dialysis-dependent or who have undergone renal transplantation is now the norm, not the exception. Hypertension needs no introduction as the most common indication for prescription drug therapy and the most important cause of premature death in the developed world. Many doctors are nervous of renal diseasethere persists a belief that renal patients suffer exclusively from complex, esoteric conditions that can only be managed in a specialist environment and by specialists who are often more diffi cult and demanding than their patients. Our intention has been to write a concise but robust handbook that is fi rst and foremost practical: what needs to be done in a busy casualty department or GP surgery several miles from the nearest renal unit. We hope it will be a useful resource not only to doctors, nurses, and other members of the multiprofessional team already engaged in the care of renal patients but also to a broader audience. For those interested in how renal disease evolves, weve provided a Good grounding in the fundamentals of nephrologyhopefully dismantling some myths along the way, and giving readers the confi dence to manage the day-to-day associated with Kidney disease. In line with existing Oxford Handbooks we have attempted to strike a balance between practical information, helpful to those working at the coal face, and the more detailed knowledge that enables effective ongoing care. The authors are all consultants working in busy renal units where theory and practice are balanced to provide effective and effi cient care. The book is as up-to-date as possible and a conscious mix of evidence and reality-based medicine. The book is laid out in twelve chapters, allowing easy access to information on a particular clinical theme. Clinical importance is measured in space, so diabetic nephropathy is given more attention than, for example, Fanconis syndrome. The section on renal replacement therapies gives an overview of the essential elements of both Dialysis and transplantation. Those looking for more detailed notes on all aspects of Dialysis therapy are referred to our sister volume The Oxford Handbook of Dialysis, or, for general nephrology and transplant topics, our parent text T he Oxford Textbook of Nephrology. For completeness, we have included practical procedures but would ask that these pages are used for guidance onlyall must be taught by experienced operators and cannot be learnt solely from a book. viii PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION We make no apology for emphasizing the importance of clinical assessment.",

    "text": "viii PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION We make no apology for emphasizing the importance of clinical assessment. Yes, tubular physiology is here (we are nephrologists after all), but this book is aimed principally at clinicians in training and we still believe that without a detailed history and thorough physical examination it is impossible to order and interpret appropriate laboratory tests or imaging, let alone provide Good quality care. This seems more important than ever at a time when many lament a diminished sense of enjoyment in the practice of medicine. We are grateful to all of our colleagues who helped bring this project to fruition as well as to our families for tolerating so many lost evenings and weekends with such Good grace. We hope that we have produced a book with personality, and one that brings its subject matter alive. We would like readers to enjoy the highways and byways of renal medicine and that we have avoided, in the words of Mark Twain, a book that everyone wants to have read, but no-one wants to read.

Several additional factors need to be considered: Asymptomatic patients often require assessment, following the discovery of an abnormal blood pressure, urinalysis, or estimated glomerular filtration rate. Symptoms, signs, and investigation fi ndings are organized into clinically useful syndromes (see Box 1. 1). Biochemistry, radiology, and/or histopathology are almost always required for accurate diagnosis (although a thorough clinical assessment will lessen over-reliance on expensive and potentially invasive tests). Diagnosis is often suggested by treatment, e. g. cessation of a nephrotoxic drug or restoration of adequate circulatory volume. See Table 1. 1 for renal disease associations.

CLINICAL HISTORY: SYMPTOMS AND SOCIAL HISTORY 5 Renal diseases are often chronic disorders, incurring appreciable social morbidity. Factors, such as social isolation, accommodation, and work situation, are hugely important. In end-stage renal disease, social circumstance will exert an important infl uence on choice of, and ability to cope with, a particular Dialysis modality. Livelihood may also be affected one of the goals of RRT, wherever possible, should be to keep an individual in employment. Q uality of life must never be forgotten amidst all the Blood tests. Review of systems May provide clues to an underlying systemic condition, such as connective tissue disorder or vasculitis. Skin rashes. Photosensitivity. Mouth ulcers. Painful, stiff, or swollen joints. Myalgia. Raynaud s phenomenon. Fevers. Night sweats. Thromboembolic episodes. Red or painful eyes. ENT: Sinusitis. Rhinitis. Epistaxis. Hearing loss. Sicca symptoms (dry eyes, dry mouth). Haemoptysis. Hair loss. Paraesthesiae. 6 CHAPTER 1 Clinical assessment Clinical history: drug, treatment, and family Drug and treatment history The importance of the drug history cannot be overstated it will often tell a story of its own. 2 Ask candidly about compliance. Antihypertensive therapy past and present. Any important tablet intolerances or side effects. Analgesics ask specifi cally about common NSAIDs (by their over-the-counter names, if necessary). Then ask again. Any one-off courses of therapy that may not be mentioned as part of regular treatment, e. g. recent antibiotics (interstitial nephritis). Oral contraceptive (i blood pressure). Steroids, immunosuppressive agents type and duration. Non-prescription, recreational (cocaine, IVDU), and herbal ( b p. 901) medicines. Current or historical exposure to important nephrotoxic drugs (see Box 1. 2). Family history Essential hypertension: more common if one or both parents affected. Diabetes mellitus (types 1 and 2): more common if close relative affected. See Table 1. 2 for inherited Kidney diseases.

Irregular menses and subfertility are frequently encountered in . Amenorrhoea is common in end-stage renal disease. Previous pregnancies and any complications (UTI, proteinuria, i blood pressure, pre-eclampsia). Miscarriages, terminations? Were infants healthy and born at term? In chronic kidney disease, maternal and fetal outcomes are importantly related to glomerular filtration rate, degree of proteinuria, and blood pressure (b p. 856). Cytotoxic drugs used in the treatment of glomerular disease can l premature menopause in or infertility in . This may infl uence treatment in a of childbearing age. Pre-treatment sperm banking can be offered in . Risk factors for sexually transmitted disease when appropriate (HIV, hepatitis B and C can all cause glomerular disease). Dietary history Changes in appetite and weight. Dietary habits (alcohol, vegan, ethnic diet, Protein or creatine supplements). Dietary advice is an important part of the management of many renal disorders (i blood pressure, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, the nephrotic syndrome, stone disease, Dialysis). Ethnicity and renal disease IgA nephropathy: Caucasians and certain Asian populations (China, Japan, and Singapore). Diabetic nephropathy: black, Mexican American, Pima Indian (a native American tribe in Southern Arizona, beloved of epidemiologists and geneticists). An increasing problem in the immigrant Asian population in the UK. SLE: Asian and black patients (and more aggressive disease). Hypertension and hypertensive renal failure: black patients. In the UK, the incidence of end-stage renal disease (end-stage renal disease) is 7 3 x higher in South Asian and black patients than in Caucasians. CLINICAL HISTORY: ADDITIONAL FACTORS 9 Approach to the patient on renal replacement therapy When managing a Dialysis or transplant patient, there are a few direct questions that will help you to get to grips with (and reassure the patient that you are familiar with) their treatment. It will also facilitate discussion with the patient s renal unit. The patient on haemodialysis Where does the haemodialysis treatment take place? How many times per week do they dialyse and how many hours is each treatment? What is the patient s current access for Dialysis (e. g. an arteriovenous fi stula, a PTFE graft, or a tunnelled Dialysis catheter)? What is their usual fl uid gain between treatments? Do they know their Blood Hypertension at the end of a Dialysis session? The patient on peritoneal Dialysis Are their exchanges performed manually during the day (continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) or automated overnight (APD)? How many exchanges do they perform? How many litres is each exchange? Do they have fl uid in at the moment? Do they need assistance to perform an exchange? Do they measure their own Blood Hypertension at home? What have the readings been recently? Is the exit site of their Dialysis catheter clean and dry? Are the Dialysis bags clear or cloudy on drainage? When was their last episode of peritonitis? All Dialysis patients How long have they been on Dialysis? How much Urine do they pass, if any?",

The right Kidney is more accessible than the left. Place the left hand posteriorly in the loin and the right hand on the abdomen lateral to the umbilicus. On deep inspiration, the lower pole may be palpable by pushing the right hand gently inwards and upwards. The normal Kidney surface usually feels fi rm and smooth. Balloting the Kidney refers to palpation whilst pushing up fi rmly from behind. Using this technique, it may be possible to gently bounce an enlarged Kidney back and forth between the hands. 12 CHAPTER 1 Clinical assessment Physical examination: the circulation 2 The ability to assess the volume status of a patient is critical to the practice of renal medicine. In the vast majority of cases, it can be achieved at the bedside without invasive monitoring. Hypovolaemia Salt and Water (or Blood) loss leads to d effective circulating volume and eventual shock. Signs include: d blood pressure (and d pulse Hypertension).",

(cid: 2) It is possible to be simultaneously saltand Water-overloaded and intravascularly depleted (e. g. CCF or a nephrotic patient receiving diuretics). See Box 1. 3.

Extremes can be relatively easy to recognize, but it is diffi cult to consistently diagnose euvolaemia, i. e. the point at which fl uid administration is no longer necessary. Clinical assessment relies on frequent evaluation of the patient s response to fl uid challenges. In case of progressive acute kidney injury, particularly in the context of multi-organ dysfunction, a referral to critical care for haemodynamic monitoring should be considered. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: THE CIRCULATION 13 Invasive monitoring: a primer for the non-intensivist In critically ill patients, the main priority is to reverse/prevent organ (including renal) dysfunction through restoration of tissue perfusion and O delivery. This involves the optimization of fl uid status and cardiac 2 output (CO) ( reminder: O delivery Heart rate stroke volume O 2 2 saturation hemoglobin 1. 36). The aim of haemodynamic resuscitation is to avoid both fl uid depletion and overload (i. e. patient n ot too dry and not too wet ) and to optimize CO whilst avoiding excess catecholamine ( enough but not more ). To achieve these goals, clinical assessment may be unreliable, and non-invasive haemodynamic monitoring is often desirable especially in patients with sepsis, hypoproteinaemia 9 cardiac failure. Measurement of cardiac output Historically, haemodynamic monitoring centred on measurement of CVP and pulmonary artery occlusion Hypertension (PaOP or wedge Hypertension ). However, many studies demonstrated that these do not accurately correlate with fl uid status and cardiac performance, particularly in patients with cardiac failure. Instead, more dynamic parameters have increasingly supplanted them, e. g. variation in stroke volume, arterial Hypertension, or pulse Hypertension after a fl uid challenge. Evidence remains light; other than for passive leg raising, there is little evidence underpinning the use of dynamic variables for prediction of volume responsiveness in non-ventilated patients. Haemodynamic monitoring used in the critical care environment Pulmonary artery catheter (PAC): insertion of a balloon-tipped catheter into the pulmonary artery allows measurement of CVP, right atrial Hypertension, right ventricular Hypertension, pulmonary artery Hypertension, PaOP, CO, and mixed venous O saturation.

Appearance Depending on concentration, normal Urine is clear or given a light yellow hue by urochrome and uroerythrin pigments. Cloudy Urine may result from High concentrations of leucocytes, epithelial cells, or bacteria. Precipitation of phosphates can also produce turbidity in Urine refrigerated for storage. Specifi c circumstances result in characteristic changes in the appearance of the Urine that may assist diagnosis at an early stage (see Box 1. 4). Blood causes a pink to black discoloration, depending on the number of RBCs and length of time present. Jaundice (conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia) may cause dark yellow or brown Urine. Haemoglobinuria from intravascular haemolysis ( b p. 155) and myoglobinuria from muscle breakdown (b p. 152) are both causes of dark Urine that tests ve for Blood on dipstick examination. However: If the sample is centrifuged, the supernatant will remain coloured and continue to test ve. No red cells are seen on microscopy. Specifi c assays for haemoglobin and myoglobin are available. Normal Urine tends to darken on standing (urobilinogen oxidizes to coloured urobilin) (see Box 1. 4). Chyluria is a rare cause of turbid Urine. It has a milky appearance (particularly after fatty meals) and settles into layers on standing. Results from a fi stulous connection between the lymphatic and urinary systems (usually malignancy, though lymphatic obstruction by F ilaria bancrofti is more important worldwide). Beetroot can produce red Urine due to enhanced intestinal absorption of the pigment betalaine in genetically susceptible individuals. Rarely causes diagnostic confusion. Odour Offensive Urine usually denotes infection (bacterial ammonium production). Sweet Urine suggests ketones. Certain rare metabolic diseases confer characteristic smells one can only hope to encounter maple-syrup Urine disease before isovaleric acidaemia ( sweaty feet Urine ) (see Box 1. 5).

Box 1. 5 Proust s chamber pot While Proust wrote lyrically about the unusual bouquet of his Urine following asparagus ingestion, there are many who remain oblivious to a phenomenon instantly recognizable to others. Two potential explanations for this olfactory diversity have been offered: (i) the production of the required fragrant metabolites is subject to variation through genetic polymorphism, i. e. some individuals excrete the perfumed compound(s), while others do not; (ii) everyone produces the metabolite(s), but only some have the necessary olfactory talent required to detect it/them. The genetics are not straightforward, although an association between the ability to notice one s own asparagus Urine and a cluster of olfactory receptor genes on chromosome 1 has been described. Even the identity of the relevant substances remains uncertain, with a plethora of sulphur-containing compounds, such as methanethiol and dimethyl sulphide, proposed as the culprits. Overall, it seems likely that there is genetic variation and that the two theories are not mutually exclusive, i. e. those who produce asparagus-perfumed Urine may not always be able to detect it, while those who can might not necessarily produce it themselves. 16 CHAPTER 1 Clinical assessment Urinalysis: chemical analysis Osmolality and specifi c gravity Specifi c gravity Refers to the weight of a solution, with respect to an equal weight of distilled Water (normal range 1. 003 1. 035 in Urine). Can be estimated with a dipstick, but, for accurate measurement, an osmometer (urinometer) is required. Osmolality Refers to the solute concentration of a solution. It cannot be measured with a dipstick. In the absence of signifi cant glycosuria, the concentrations of sodium, chloride , and urea are the most important determinants in Urine. The ability to vary Urine osmolality (range 50 1350mOsmol/kg) plays a central role in the regulation of plasma osmolality (maintained across a narrow range: 280 305mOsmol/kg). Generally speaking, specifi c gravity and osmolality correlate. An exception is when relatively large particles, such as glucose, proteins, and radio contrast media, are present in the Urine. These produce an i in specifi c gravity, with little change in osmolality. Uses Investigation of polyuria and hypo-/hypernatraemic states (b p. 782). Recurrent stone formers can monitor their own Urine specifi c gravity to maintain a dilute Urine that discourages stone development. Isosthenuria chronic kidney disease leads to a progressive d in the range of urinary osmolality that the kidneys can generate. In advanced renal insuffi ciency, the osmolality becomes relatively fi xed at 7 300mOsmol/kg (7 1. 010 specifi c gravity) close to that of glomerular fi ltrate. In this situation, the Urine cannot be adequately concentrated or diluted in response to sodium and Water depletion and overload, respectively. This is termed isosthenuria. Urinary pH Urinary pH ranges from 4. 5 to 8. 0 (usually 5. 0 6. 0), depending on systemic acid b ase status. Most people (except vegans) pass acidic Urine the majority of the time. Isolated urinary pH measurements provide very little useful information. Their main clinical use is the investigation of systemic metabolic acidosis. In this situation, a fall in urinary pH (to around 5) is expected, as acid is excreted. Failure of this response may indicate renal tubular acidosis ( b p. 824). Most Urine dipsticks have an indicator strip for estimation of pH, but, if a tubular disorder is suspected, a pH meter should be used. In certain situations, the therapeutic manipulation of urinary pH might be useful (see Box 1. 6). URINALYSIS: CHEMICAL ANALYSIS 17 Box 1.",

Detection of neutrophil esterase activity identifi es white cells (pyuria), while the nitrite test exploits the ability of some urinary pathogens (though not all notably certain Gram ve organisms, including S trep. faecalis, Staph. albus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, as well as many P seudomonas spp. and mycobacteria) to reduce nitrate l nitrite. Positivity requires an adequate dietary nitrate intake as well as suffi cient bladder dwell time (preferably 4h). When combined, these methods possess Good specifi city (i. e. take seriously if ve) though only modest sensitivity (i. e. treat a ve result with caution if infection is likely clinically). 2 While they can serve as a useful screening test in at-risk populations they are not a substitute for microscopy and culture. Bilirubin and urobilinogen Conjugated ( 6 Water-soluble) bilirubin l biliary excretion l small bowel l converted to urobilinogen l distal reabsorption l partially excreted in the Urine. This means: (i) unconjugated (Water-insoluble) bilirubin does not pass into the Urine ( 6 dipstick ve bilirubin indicates hepatic or cholestatic disease); (ii) the absence of dipstick urobilinogen in a jaundiced patient suggests biliary obstruction. Glucose Glycosuria results when tubular reabsorptive capacity for glucose is exceeded (plasma level 10mmol/L). A valuable screening tool, but less useful for diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes mellitus. Renal glycosuria occurs when proximal tubular injury leads to a failure to reabsorb fi ltered glucose ( b p. 76). Causes of a ve dipstick for ketones Dipsticks semi-quantitatively detect acetoacetate (but not B -hydroxybutyrate). A ve test can be seen in: Diabetic ketoacidosis (and occasionally severe intercurrent illness in type 2 diabetes mellitus). Prolonged fasting and starvation diets (e. g. Atkins diet). Alcoholic ketoacidosis. Severe volume depletion. Isopropyl alcohol poisoning (hand-rubs, solvents, and de-icers). URINALYSIS: FURTHER TESTS 19 Urinary test strips A variety of test strips for urinalysis are available. Some have a specifi c purpose, e. g. Clinistix (glucose), Hemastix (Blood), and Albustix (albumin). Others cast a wider net, with various combinations of the following: Specifi c gravity. pH. Leucocytes. Nitrites. Glucose. Urobilinogen. Bilirubin. Ketones. Albumin or Protein. Blood. Dipsticks able to detect microalbuminuria are also available. 20 CHAPTER 1 Clinical assessment Urinalysis: Protein Introduction Urinary Protein excretion should not exceed 150mg/day, of which less than 20mg is albumin. The remainder consists mainly of non-serum-derived tubular mucoprotein, such as Tamm Horsfall/uromodulin. i excretion of albumin is a sensitive marker of renal, particularly glomerular, disease ( b p. 58). Protein excretion can be measured in untimed ( spot ) or timed (usually 24h) samples. Proteinuria (total Protein) and albuminuria (albumin) are not strictly interchangeable terms. When screening for early renal disease, specifi c tests for albumin are preferable. Dipsticks Convenient, highly specifi c, but less sensitive. Contain pH-sensitive indicators that change colour when bound to negatively charged proteins. Predominantly detect albumin (some are albumin-specifi c, e. g. Albustix ) and may not identify large amounts of other proteins, e. g. Bence Jones. Dipsticks have completely superseded sulphosalicylic acid turbidity testing.

    "text": "Dipsticks have completely superseded sulphosalicylic acid turbidity testing. A ve result occurs with Protein excretion ≥ 300mg/L. Lower amounts of proteinuria, particularly in the context of Diabetes, are termed microalbuminuria ( b p. 60) (defi ned as 30 300mg/day) and usually measured by ELISA or radioimmunoassay (although sensitive dipsticks are available). Dipsticks are semi-quantitative. As a rough guide: Trace 70. 150. 3g/L 70. 3g/L 71g/L 72. 55g/L 10g/L (cid: 2) Changes in urinary concentration affect the result.

Concentrated morning samples are 6 preferable. 2 If ve dipstick test of ≥ 1, repeat after 1 2 wk. If persistent, verify with a Protein/Creatinine ratio (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio) or albumin/Creatinine ratio (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio). Timed collections Historically, 24h Urine collections were preferred to spot Urine samples. However, they suffered from signifi cant drawbacks, including inaccurate collection (see Box 1. 7) and the time required for lab processing. URINALYSIS: Protein 21 Box 1. 7 urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (see also b p. 197) Untimed ( spot ) Urine samples are now used virtually universally for the detection and monitoring of proteinuria. Urinary excretion of Creatinine generally remains constant ( 7 10mmol/day). urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio correct for variations in urinary concentration (caused by changes in hydration) and correlate well with measurements obtained from timed collections. A fi rst morning Urine specimen is preferable. 2 The relationship between urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio is non-linear (see Table 1. 3). It can be helpful to multiply urine protein-to-creatinine ratio x 10 to provide an estimate of 24h excretion, e. g. urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 125mg/mmol approximates to 1. 25g/24h. In the USA and in labs where urinary creatinine is measured in milligrams per deciliter, rather than millimoles per liter, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is expressed as magnesium/g. Normal: 30mg/g. Microalbuminuria: 30 300mg/g. Overt proteinuria: 300mg/g. urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio will underestimate proteinuria when creatinine excretion is High (black people, muscular build) and overestimate when creatinine excretion is Low (elderly, cachectic). However, they are useful for serial monitoring in individual patients. urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is more sensitive than urine protein-to-creatinine ratio if screening for early disease in High-risk groups (especially Diabetes), but total urine protein-to-creatinine ratio is an adequate alternative in most circumstances. Dipsticks that aim to estimate urine protein-to-creatinine ratio await further validation. Table 1. 3 Relationship between urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (magnesium/mmol) urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (magnesium/mmol) g/24h Interpretation 330 0. 3 Microalbuminuria 30 750 70. 5 Overt proteinuria 70 7100 71 300 7350 73. 5 Nephrotic range Timed 24h collection: what to tell the patient Non-acidifi ed, clearly labelled container. Pick a convenient day with minimum commitments. Discard fi rst Urine void on that day. Start collection all subsequent Urine into the container (including overnight). First void the following day into the collection. Since creatinine excretion, or Creatinine clearance (creatinine clearance) (b p. 33), should be similar in two successive samples from the same patient, their measurement in back to back 24h collections may enhance reliability (i. e. disregard the result if creatinine clearance differs greatly between the two). 22 CHAPTER 1 Clinical assessment Urinalysis: red Blood cells Introduction Haematuria is defi ned (arbitrarily) as the presence of two RBCs per High-powered fi eld (hpf) in spun Urine.

However, if a dipstick is ve, it is still desirable to perform confi rmatory microscopy. Dipsticks detect hemoglobin and 6 remain ve, even after red blood cell lysis. They also detect haemoglobinuria from intravascular haemolysis as well as myoglobin from muscle breakdown (l though red cells will be absent on microscopy in both situations).

Use polarized light to identify crystals. Clean the microscope, and discard all the Urine! In an urgent situation, e. g. for rapid diagnosis of UTI, an unspun sample may be examined.

Trichomonas: oval and fl agellate (motile if alive). Usually a genital contaminant. Schistosoma haematobium: ova detection is an important technique in endemic areas. URINALYSIS: CELLS, ORGANISMS, AND CASTS 25 Urine culture M, CS differentiates contamination from true infection and guides treatment. A pure growth of 10 5 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL is the conventional diagnostic criterion for urinary tract infection (b p. 707). Casts Casts are plugs of Tamm Horsfall mucoprotein within the renal tubules, with a characteristic cylindrical shape. They are classifi ed according to appearance and the cellular elements embedded in them. Though produced in normal kidneys, they can be valuable clues to the presence of renal disease (see Fig. 1. 4). Non-cellular casts Hyaline casts: mucoprotein alone and virtually transparent. A non-specifi c fi nding that occurs in concentrated Urine. Granular casts: granular material (aggregates of Protein or cellular remnants) is embedded in the cast. Often pathological but non-specifi c. Broad or waxy casts: hyaline material with a waxy appearance under the microscope. Form in dilated, poorly functioning tubules of advanced chronic kidney disease. Cellular casts Red cell casts: 2 virtually diagnostic of glomerulonephritis. White cell casts: characteristic of acute pyelonephritis may help to distinguish upper from lower tract infection. Also occur in TIN. Epithelial cell casts: sloughed epithelial cells embedded in mucoprotein. A non-specifi c feature of ATN. Also found in glomerulonephritis. Fatty casts: contain either lipid-fi lled tubular epithelial cells or free lipid globules. Distinguished from other casts by Maltese cross appearance under polarized light. Occur in the lipid-laden Urine of the nephrotic syndrome. Lipids may also appear as droplets or crystals. When clumped, these are referred to as oval fat bodies. Other casts: under the right conditions, any constituent of the Urine (microorganisms, crystals, bilirubin, or myoglobin) may become entrapped in a mucoprotein cast. 26 CHAPTER 1 Clinical assessment (a) (b) Fig. 1. 4 a) Granular cast. b) Red cell cast.

The most important is glomerular fi ltration rate (glomerular filtration rate). Glomerular fi ltrate refers to the ultrafi ltrate of plasma that crosses the glomerular barrier into the urinary space. glomerular filtration rate is measured per unit time (usually expressed milliliters per minute) and represents the sum of fi ltration rates in all functioning nephrons ( 6 a surrogate for the amount of functioning renal tissue). glomerular filtration rate is relatively constant in an individual. d glomerular filtration rate may result from a reduction in nephron number or a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate of single nephrons (d SNGFR). A reduction in number can be compensated for by an increase in SNGFR through elevated glomerular capillary Hypertension or glomerular hypertrophy ( (cid: 2) this means signifi cant Kidney damage may not initially be associated with d glomerular filtration rate). glomerular filtration rate is useful for: Providing a consistent measure of Kidney function. Monitoring progression of chronic kidney disease (and response to treatment). Forecasting the need for Dialysis and transplantation. Determining appropriate drug dosing in renal impairment (b p. 874). It provides no information regarding the cause of renal insuffi ciency. Measurement of glomerular filtration rate Measured indirectly by evaluating clearance from plasma of a (renally excreted) marker substance. Clearance: the volume of plasma from which this substance is removed per unit time. Suitable markers require certain characteristics shown in the following list and may be endogenous (e. g. creatinine) or exogenous (e. g. inulin). Inulin, a fructose polysaccharide for which (along with fl atulence) we have the Jerusalem artichoke to thank, remains the gold standard. Cost and technical considerations (it requires a continuous infusion) prohibit routine use. Characteristics of an ideal clearance marker Safe to administer, economical, and easy to measure. Freely fi ltered at the glomerulus. Not Protein-bound (able to distribute in the extracellular space). Present at a stable plasma concentration. No extra-renal elimination. Not reabsorbed, secreted, or metabolized by the Kidney. DETERMINING RENAL FUNCTION 31 In clinical practice, glomerular filtration rate is estimated by one of the following means: Serum creatinine (and, to a lesser extent, urea). Formulae based on the serum Creatinine (estimated or estimated glomerular filtration rate). Creatinine clearance (creatinine clearance) from a 24h Urine collection. Isotopic clearance (e. g. European Dialysis and Transplant Association-glomerular filtration rate or diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid scan-glomerular filtration rate). Aspects of renal function Glomerular fi ltration rate (glomerular filtration rate). Tubular function (including sodium and potassium handling and urinary concentrating/diluting capacity). Acid base balance. Endocrine function: Renin angiotensin system (renal artery stenosis). Erythropoietin production. Vitamin D metabolism. Not measured in clinical practice Autocrine ( l production of endothelins, prostaglandins, natriuretic peptides, nitric oxide). Protein and polypeptide metabolism (e. g. insulin catabolism).",

It is estimated that it is measured over 300 million times annually in the USA. Generated from non-enzymatic metabolism of creatine in skeletal muscle. Production is proportional to muscle mass (20g muscle l 7 1mg creatinine). Little short-term variation in an individual. 7 25% is derived from dietary meat intake (creatine mostly; Creatinine if the meat is stewed). d muscle mass (elderly, cachectic) li creatinine production l overestimation of glomerular filtration rate. U x V is relatively constant in the formula for creatinine clearance (where V is volume). creatinine So creatinine clearance (urineCr x V)/plasmaCr Becomes creatinine clearance constant/plasmaCr Hence, serum creatinine varies inversely with glomerular filtration rate: d glomerular filtration rate l i serum creatinine (until a new steady state is reached). creatinine meets many, but not all, of the criteria for a clearance marker. Shortcomings: It is secreted by the proximal tubule ( 7 10 20% when glomerular filtration rate is normal), so the amount excreted in the Urine exceeds the amount fi ltered. As glomerular filtration rate falls, there is a progressive i in tubular secretion until saturation occurs at serum creatinine 7 132 176 μ mol/L (1. 52. 0 milligrams per deciliter); beyond this point, serum creatinine rises as expected (see Fig. 1. 6). It undergoes extra-renal elimination by secretion and degradation in the GI tract. This becomes more important as glomerular filtration rate falls. When d glomerular filtration rate is rapid, it takes time for a steady state to be reached and for serum creatinine to i, i. e. serum creatinine may initially be normal after a catastrophic renal insult. Traditionally measured using the Jaff é alkaline pictrate colorimetric assay. However, interference by non-Creatinine chromogens created a tradition of overestimating creatinine. Enzymatic methods on modern auto-analysers are generally more accurate, with less variability. Certain substances interfere with creatinine, either through competitive inhibition of tubular secretion (cimetidine, trimethoprim, amiloride, spironolactone, triamterene) or assay interference (in the Jaffé reaction: bilirubin, ketoacids, vitamin C, glucose, and cephalosporins).

This is termed estimated or estimated glomerular filtration rate. Such equations attempt to correct for the confounding effects of body weight, age, sex, race, and muscle mass. Limitations Still based on creatinine and do not take into account tubular secretion, extra-renal elimination, or differences in production between individuals of the same age and sex, or the same individual over time.

However, remains poorly validated in children (age 18 years), elderly (age 70 years), pregnancy, ethnic groups other than Caucasians and African Americans, and those without chronic kidney disease. estimated glomerular filtration rate, in milliliters per minute per 1. 73m2 (170 x (P milligrams per deciliter) exp 0. 999) x (Age exp 0. 176) x ((S milligrams per deciliter) C e r xp 0. 170) x ((Albumin grams per deciliter) exp0. 318) Urea Multiply x 0. 762 if the patient is Multiply x 1. 180 if the patient is black.

Uses the same variables as MDRD. The study population included individuals with and without Kidney disease over a wide range of GFRs. The equation provides a more accurate assessment of glomerular filtration rate in individuals with normal or only slightly d glomerular filtration rate (particularly glomerular filtration rate 60mL/min), resulting in: Lower estimates of population chronic kidney disease prevalence. More accurate prediction of adverse outcomes. There are still important limitations: 7 50% will have an estimated glomerular filtration rate that is 16mL/min different from true measured glomerular filtration rate (although this represents a slightly improvement over MDRD). Although most laboratories currently report an MDRD estimated glomerular filtration rate, a move to adopt chronic kidney disease-EPI for routine clinical use is likely to be increasingly advocated.

Reciprocal of plasma Creatinine There is an inverse relationship between glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine: creatinine clearance constant / serum creatinine Plotting the reciprocal of serum creatinine (1/serum creatinine) against time will often, though not always, produce a straight line, the slope of the curve representing change in glomerular filtration rate with time. A logarithmic plot of serum creatinine can be used in a similar way. This may be useful in two settings: Extrapolation of the line can help predict when chronic kidney disease is likely to reach end-stage renal disease and 6 assist timely planning of RRT. A change in the slope of the curve can be used to monitor treatment: a d in the slope indicates slowed progression, while an i may indicate a 2nd insult (acute-on-chronic Kidney injury). 36 CHAPTER 1 Clinical assessment glomerular filtration rate measurement: other methods Isotopic glomerular filtration rate Several radiopharmaceuticals (5 1 creatinine-European Dialysis and Transplant Association, 9 9m Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid scan, 1 25 I-iothalamate) compare favourably to inulin for the measurement of glomerular filtration rate. Isotopic techniques are expensive. Method A single IV injection, followed by venous sampling at regular intervals (intervals i, as expected glomerular filtration rate d ). Post-injection, plasma isotope activity d rapidly, as it distributes throughout the ECF. A slower exponential decline (renal elimination) then follows, allowing glomerular filtration rate to be determined. Protocols based on Urine collection are also described. With diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid scan, renal elimination is often measured with a gamma camEuropean Renal Association positioned directly over the kidneys. While not as precise as venous sampling, it enables assessment of each individual Kidney s contribution to total glomerular filtration rate (termed split function ) ( b p. 54). Cystatin C The variable nature of creatinine production has encouraged the search for alternative endogenous compounds that might help estimate glomerular filtration rate. Cystatin C, a 13kDa cysteine protease inhibitor, is the most developed of these. Produced by all nucleated cells and freely fi ltered at the glomerulus before tubular reabsorption and metabolism. Unlike creatinine, it does not undergo tubular secretion, but a degree of extra-renal elimination is likely. Unfortunately, despite early optimism, several important non-glomerular filtration rate determinants of cystatin C concentration have been identifi ed. Advancing age, male sex, Diabetes, i body mass index, i albumin, and i CRP are all associated with increased levels. Relative High or Low cell turnover, e. g. i / d thyroidism or steroid treatment ( (cid: 2) transplant patients! ), also cause variability. Several cystatin C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate equations have been formulated (as have equations that incorporate both cystatin C and serum creatinine). At present, there remains considerable uncertainty as to any advantages for glomerular filtration rate estimation, both in the general population and existing chronic kidney disease. Available data are frustratingly inconsistent. A shorter half-life and smaller volume of distribution led to an expectation that it might be a more useful marker in the non-steady state, particularly acute kidney injury. However, results have proved variable. There also appears to be no clear-cut advantage in the context of Low muscle mass. Nonetheless, cystatin C appears to be a better predictor of adverse outcomes than either serum creatinine or estimated glomerular filtration rate based on the serum creatinine. There is also signifi cant current inter-assay and inter-laboratory variability, although progress is being made toward standardization.",

Effect on renal function glomerular filtration rate The Baltimore longitudinal study (1958 1 981) used serial measurements of creatinine clearance to show a d glomerular filtration rate of 0. 75mL/min/year. Recent studies have used inulin clearances to show that, although glomerular filtration rate progressively falls in older age groups ( ), it is not necessarily an inevitability. There may be no demonstrable decline in normotensive, otherwise healthy, individuals, so it remains important to consider the effect associated comorbidities ( i blood pressure, vascular disease, CCF, etc. ) may be having over and above age itself. RENAL FUNCTION IN THE ELDERLY 39 Assessment of glomerular filtration rate serum creatinine is less useful in the elderly because of (i) d muscle mass and (ii) d urinary creatinine excretion. This means that formulae based on serum creatinine (including MDRD, Cockcroft G ault, and chronic kidney disease-EPI) tend to underestimate glomerular filtration rate in those age 65 (and are not actually robustly validated in this population). Additional effects of renal ageing d renal plasma fl ow. Microalbuminuria and overt albuminuria more common. Regulation of sodium balance is impaired ( d excretion l contributes to i blood pressure in the context of a High-salt western diet). i potassium more common ( d excretion and d aldosterone). The elderly are 6 vulnerable to the effect of any medication interfering with potassium excretion (such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor).",

Although age-related d glomerular filtration rate is common anyway, it will be exaggerated in the presence of comorbidity, such as i blood pressure and vascular disease. X chronic kidney disease is common in the elderly: In NHANES (1999 2004), nearly 7 45% of elderly subjects had chronic kidney disease ( b p. 194) by current criteria, with those aged 70 accounting for 50% of chronic kidney disease overall. However, is early chronic kidney disease relevant in this age group? For example, glomerular filtration rate 50 59mL/min does not increase CV mortality in comparison to 60mL/min? In view of this, many believe chronic kidney disease is an unhelpful term in the majority of individuals in this age group. The incidence and prevalence of end-stage renal disease is higher in the elderly (mean age of RRT is mid-60s). acute kidney injury and acute-on-chronic Kidney disease are both more common. The elderly are more vulnerable to the effects of nephrotoxic drugs. The elderly are also more prone to electrolyte imbalances occurring through disease or inappropriate medical management (e. g. indisciplined perioperative fl uid therapy). 40 CHAPTER 1 Clinical assessment Immunological and serological investigation Introduction Immunological and serological testing are widely (perhaps too widely) undertaken in the work-up of many forms of renal disease. Although helpful, such tests are rarely diagnostic in isolation and must always be interpreted in the context of a detailed clinical assessment. There are a few common scenarios where the renal screen is often performed (see Table 1. 5): Unexplained acute kidney injury ( b p. 119) or progressive chronic kidney disease. For correlation with histology after a renal biopsy ( b p. 82). During follow-up to assess disease activity or response to treatment.

Plain X-ray kidney, ureter, bladder (kidneys ureter bladder). Essentially, a supine AXR centred on the umbilicus. Main role is identifi cation and surveillance of calcifi cation (see Box 1. 9). Lateral and oblique fi lms may differentiate calcifi cation in line with, as opposed to in, the renal tract. The medial edges of both psoas muscles are usually visible disappearance suggests a perinephric mass or retroperitoneal collection. Tomography keeps one particular image plane in focus, blurring out images in front and behind. Moving the plane can produce serial cuts that detect small calculi. Now largely superseded by computed tomography. (cid: 2) Remember the radiation exposure of an AXR is 35 x that of a CXR. Where are the kidneys on a plain AXR? Differences in attenuation between renal tissue and perinephric fat mean that the kidneys are (just) visible. Usually adjacent to the upper border of the T11 through to the lower border of L3. Normal renal size is 11 15cm (in adults). Kidneys appear bigger on an AXR than on ultrasound. Right Kidney usually shorter than the left (upper limit of variation in length between right and left 1. 5cm).

MR angiography: X Detection of renovascular disease ( b p. 586). Gadolinium and nephrogenic systemic fi brosis The MR contrast agent gadolinium (Gd) has been implicated in the development of nephrogenic systemic fi brosis (NSF). NSF is a rare, painful, and often disabling, skin lesion that can progress to involve internal organs (including muscle, Heart, and lungs). It was fi rst described in the late 1990s and only occurs in renal failure. The dermopathy appears scleroderma-like: erythema, plaques, induration, and peau d orange, with the lower legs and forearms initially affected. Subsequent periarticular tissue involvement leads to contractures and immobility. Pathology: CD34 ve fi brocyte proliferation, with dermal thickening. Gd may be detected in the lesions. Exact pathophysiology uncertain; however, Gd tissue deposition, with TGFB -induced fi brosis and fi brocyte collagen production, appears important. Gd exposure has been implicated in 95% cases: Free Gd is relatively Water-insoluble (and highly toxic) so requires chelation for in vivo use. These chelates may be ionic or non-ionic and linear or cyclical. Ionic and cyclic forms bind Gd more avidly, perhaps explaining an apparent variance in risk between preparations, e. g. higher for gadodiamide and gadopentetate. Gd chelates are renally excreted, so half-life is glomerular filtration rate-dependent. NSF incidence increases greatly below glomerular filtration rate 30mL/min. Most reports have been in Dialysis patients. Peritoneal Dialysis (peritoneal dialysis) patients may be at higher risk. Risk is probably 5% for an end-stage renal disease patient exposed to Gd. Prevention: If glomerular filtration rate 30mL/min (and especially glomerular filtration rate 15mL/min), Gd exposure should be limited to situations where it is deemed essential. Avoid chelates that are more strongly associated with NSF, and limit the administered dose. If already on maintenance haemodialysis, many dialyse the patient immediately after exposure (and again at 24h). This reduces Gd half-life, but additional evidence of benefi t is lacking. X Some advocate haemodialysis for patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate 15mL/min), even if not already established on maintenance RRT. In confi rmed disease, transplantation offers the best chance of improvement. Cases should be reported to the International NSF Registry (M ).",

Good for detecting calculi. However, the growth of computed tomography, including computed tomography urography, has seen a very signifi cant decline in use (see Fig. 1. 8 for IVU scan). The procedure Ensure Good bowel prep, NBM for 4h pre-procedure. If glomerular filtration rate normal, a fl uid restriction of 7 500mL/prior 24h assists contrast concentration ((cid: 2) dangerous if d glomerular filtration rate 6 often avoided). Includes (fi lm sequence altered, according to clinical situation): Plain control fi lm (? opacities pre-contrast). Post-contrast: bilateral nephrograms (delayed: poor perfusion, obstruction, ATN, venous thrombosis), renal outline (? ischaemic scars, refl ux, TB). Further exposures at 5 and 10min (after meals fi lling defects: clot, tumour, sloughed papilla, stone. after meals deformity: refl ux). Mild abdominal compression delays contrast excretion and may improve after meals system views. Post-voiding fi lm to assess bladder outfl ow. Delayed fi lms (2, 6, 12, and 24h) may establish a level of obstruction. Modifi cations IVU with furosemide: furosemide exaggerates and distinguishes PUJ obstruction from normal anatomical variants ( baggy pelvis). High-dose IVU: used if d glomerular filtration rate limits contrast excretion. Largely redundant where USS and computed tomography are available. Metformin There is often apprehension that continued metformin use prior to IV contrast administration may contribute to contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-acute kidney injury) (b p. 148) post-procedure. It is important to remember that metformin is not nephrotoxic. However, it does undergo renal excretion and may accumulate, potentially causing a severe lactic acidosis, if glomerular filtration rate deteriorates post-contrast. The pre-contrast withdrawal of metformin does not reduce the risk of CI-acute kidney injury, but, if CI-acute kidney injury develops, metformin should be stopped immediately with glycaemic control achieved by other means until glomerular filtration rate recovers. Those with pre-existing signifi cant renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate 30mL/ min) who are at particular risk of CI-acute kidney injury should almost certainly not be taking metformin anyway. This can be clarifi ed with the responsible clinician. An estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30 60mL/min is a grey area, but there is no current recommendation to stop metformin, as long as the patient is supervised appropriately through the contrast procedure ( b p. 149).

Three types: glomerular filtration rate estimation (e. g. 5 1 creatinine-European Dialysis and Transplant Association ) ( b p. 36). Dynamic (e. g. 9 9m Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid scan, 9 9m Tc-MAG 3): serial scans track renal uptake, transit, and excretion of an isotope. A time-activity curve is generated. Static (e. g. 99m Tc-DMSA): isotope is taken up and retained within functioning tissue. Demonstrates non-functioning ( scarred ) renal tissue. See Fig. 1. 9 for diuretic renogram. Radiopharmaceuticals 9 9m Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid scan. Filtered at the glomerulus and neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the tubules. A Good marker of glomerular filtration rate but limited utility in more severe renal impairment (e. g. serum creatinine 200μmol/L (72. 2mg/dL)). 9 9m Tc-MAG 3. Principally excreted by tubular secretion so useful if d glomerular filtration rate. Less background uptake than diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid scan but more expensive. 99m Tc-DMSA. Filtered at the glomerulus, then reabsorbed and retained in the proximal tubules. Subsequent excretion is slow. Used for parenchymal imaging. Applications Function of each Kidney (termed split function) (diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid scan, MAG 3, DMSA). Congenital abnormalities (DMSA), e. g. horseshoe Kidney, ectopic pelvic kidneys. Chronic pyelonephritis and vesicoureteric refl ux (DMSA) ( b p. 712): Focal scarring (more than one cause). diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid scan-cystogram: refl ux follow-up and sibling screening. Renal transplantation: perfusion and obstruction. Acute Kidney injury ( b p. 120). Dilated vs obstructed renal pelvis: A dilated pelvis may not indicate true obstruction. Diuretic renography (diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid scan or MAG 3) may differentiate the two. Arterial occlusion (diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid scan, MAG 3): failure of perfusion. Captopril renography in renovascular disease (b p. 586): In renal artery stenosis (renal artery stenosis), perfusion and 6 glomerular filtration rate are maintained by A2-mediated efferent arteriolar constriction. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor administration will block this and alter the uptake and excretion of diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid scan or MAG 3. A positive scan suggesting renal artery stenosis: Asymmetry of size and function. Delayed time to peak activity. Cortical isotope retention.

Technique A retrograde catheter is passed under fl uoroscopic guidance via a femoral puncture. A fl ush aortogram reveals number and location of renal arteries before selective catheterization (intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IVDSA) is generally inadequate). Contrast nephrotoxicity (b p. 148) is a concern, and CO has been used as an alternative to iodinated media. 2 Indications Renovascular disease: Invasive 6 not an ideal screening test ( b p. 586). May be preferred when clinical suspicion for renal artery stenosis is High, and there is an intention to proceed immediately to angioplasty and endovascular stenting. Acute renal ischaemia: Acute emboli or thrombosis, traumatic occlusion, dissection. Therapeutic intervention (e. g. thrombolysis) may be possible. Unexplained haematuria: Vascular lesions (e. g. AVM, angioma). May allow embolization. Classical polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) (b p. 652): Intrarenal microaneurysms. Renal transplantation: Evaluation of donor anatomy prior to live Kidney donation ( b p. 374), although most now perform computed tomography angiography in this situation. Bleeding post-renal biopsy: Identify bleeding source ( 9 therapeutic embolization). Uroradiology Urethrography and cystography Contrast l urethra 9 bladder. Indications: trauma, urethral stricture, bladder diverticulae or fi stulae. computed tomography cystography increasingly used. Micturating cystourethrography (MCUG) A contrast-fi lled bladder and urethra are visualized during voiding. Gold standard for diagnosis of VUR ( b p. 712). Demonstrates refl ux and dilatation/distortion of the ureters and after meals system. Hypertension-fl ow videocystometrography involves measurement of bladder pressures and Urine fl ow rate, in addition to imaging. DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING: ANGIOGRAPHY AND URORADIOLOGY 57 Retrograde ureteropyelography The ureteric orifi ces are cystoscopically cannulated and contrast injected under fl uoroscopic screening. Ureter, PUJ, and after meals system can be visualized. May precede insertion of a retrograde ureteric stent. Antegrade ureteropyelography (percutaneous nephrostomy) A needle is placed percutaneously into the renal pelvis under fl uoroscopic or USS guidance. Contrast media is injected to evaluate after meals, ureteric, and bladder anatomy. Urine l culture and cytology. Hypertension studies can be undertaken in suspected PUJ obstruction (Whitaker test) ( b p. 736). Indications: relief of urinary obstruction ( b p. 734), dilation of ureteric strictures, antegrade stent placement, removal of calculi. Ileal loopography The loop is fi lled with contrast, following the introduction of a Foley catheter. Upper tract dilatation is common after ileal diversion and free refl ux of contrast into the ureters is almost universal if not present, obstruction at the ureteric insertion (most common site) should be suspected. Cystourethroscopy, ureteroscopy, and ureterorenoscopy Cystourethroscopy or cystoscopy involves a visual inspection of the inside of the urethra and bladder, using either a fl exible (outpatient, no need for anaesthetic, little capacity to biopsy) or rigid (inpatient, anaesthetic, can biopsy if necessary) cystoscope. Undertaken by urologists, rather than radiologists. Indications include: Investigation of microand macroscopic haematuria. Recurrent UTIs. Unexplained lower tract symptoms. Surveillance of bladder tumours. Flexible ureterorenoscopy involves passing a small fl exible fi breoptic transurethral endoscope through the bladder and as far up as the renal pelvis. Rigid ureteroscopy does not generally reach this distance and generally requires a general anaesthetic, although it does allow biopsies to be taken. 58 CHAPTER 1 Clinical assessment Clinical syndromes: proteinuria introduction Protein excretion 150mg/d is normal. 7 30mg of this is albumin; the rest is LMW Protein, including B 2 microglobulin, enzymes, and peptide hormones.

    "text": "9; see also b p. 20). Why is abnormal proteinuria important? It is a marker of intrinsic renal disease, particularly glomerular injury. It is a risk factor for the progression of renal insuffi ciency. It is an independent risk factor for CV morbidity and mortality What is the relevance of a positive dipstick for Protein? Dipsticks predominantly detect albumin ( b p. 20). They are generally ve if Protein excretion 300mg/d. Dipstick proteinuria has a prevalence of around 5% in healthy individuals (usually trace to 1 range). Further evaluation is mandatory to distinguish benign from pathological proteinuria. What is pathological proteinuria? Persistent Protein excretion 150mg/d implies renal/systemic disease. The amount and composition depend on the nature of renal injury. Urinary electrophoresis can distinguish the source. Glomerular Failure of the glomerular barrier allows passage of intermediate and High MW Protein. The most important cause of proteinuria in clinical practice. The predominant Protein is albumin. Tubular LMW proteins, such as immunoglobulin light chains and B microglobulin, 2 normally pass through the glomerulus and are reabsorbed by proximal tubular cells. Damage to the proximal tubule disrupts this cycle and results in tubular proteinuria. (cid: 2) This is not detectable on dipstick examination. Overfl ow Overproduction of LMW plasma proteins exceeds the capacity of the normal proximal tubule to reabsorb them. Causes: (i) immunoglobulin light chains in myeloma; (ii) lysozyme in monomyelocytic leukaemia. Dipstick examination will be negative; specifi c assays are required. Secretory proteinuria Protein added to the Urine lower in the urinary tract (e. g. bladder tumour, prostatitis). Blood (50mL/24h) will also cause proteinuria (but not albuminuria).

Proteinuria with accompanying microscopic haematuria strongly suggests glomerular disease. When may proteinuria be benign ? Transient Fever. Exercise. Extreme cold. Seizures. CCF. Severe acute illnesses. Persistent Postural (orthostatic) proteinuria: Normal subjects demonstrate a small i in Protein excretion on standing. Postural proteinuria is an exaggeration of this. Relatively common in young adults (7 3 5%). Rare age 30. Usually 1g/24h. Diagnose with a split Urine collection: 16h daytime and 8h overnight collection (simpler: ve dipstick (or urine protein-to-creatinine ratio) on waking, ve at night). Renal function remains normal, even after prolonged follow-up. Remits with time (remains in 7 50% cases at 10 years and 25% at 20 years). Possible mechanisms: (i) trivial glomerular lesion; (ii) i circulating A2 and noradrenaline when upright l i glomerular permeability; (iii) renal vein entrapment between aorta and superior mesenteric artery l local haemodynamic disturbance ( nutcracker syndrome also a possible cause of microscopic haematuria). 60 CHAPTER 1 Clinical assessment Clinical syndromes: proteinuria What is microalbuminuria? The term microalbuminuria describes albuminuria above the normal range (30mg) but below the threshold of traditional dipsticks (300mg). A misleading term, implying the albumin is of lower molecular weight. This is not the case the micro- prefi x is simply meant to refl ect the Low amount. This has led to newer terminology, such as moderately increased albuminuria for microalbuminuria and severely increased albuminuria for macroalbuminuria. It is a sensitive indicator of: Early renal disease. CV risk in diabetes mellitus, i blood pressure, and several other conditions. It is detected by spot microalbumin/Creatinine ratio, ultrasensitive dipstick, or radioimmunoassay on a 24h Urine collection (b p. 20).

CLINICAL SYNDROMES: PROTEINURIA 61 Microalbuminuria and cardiovascular risk Microalbuminuria (or High albuminuria ) is a marker of CV risk. This applies to the general population, not just diabetes mellitus or i blood pressure. The mechanisms underpinning this association are poorly understood, but microalbuminuria, endothelial dysfunction, and chronic infl ammation are interrelated processes that develop and progress together. Microalbuminuria can be correlated to the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, LV dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, and death, e. g. in the HOPE (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation) trial and follow up of the Framingham cohort. blood pressure reduction is the key to microalbuminuria reduction renal artery stenosis blockade with ACE inhibitors or ARBs (or both) appears to be the treatment of choice. There is no present consensus on microalbuminuria screening in non-diabetics, though screening of hypertensive patients (and other High-risk groups) is advocated by some authorities; e. g. the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA).

Gross haematuria startles the patient and 6 presents early. The patient may not recognize Blood and report discoloration (pink, smoky, cola, or tea-like). 2 Macroscopic haematuria always requires investigation (presenting complaint in 7 85% of bladder and 7 40% of renal tumours). Heavy bleeding with clot formation almost never occurs in glomerular disease. Microscopic ( b p. 66): Blood only visible under High-powered microscopy. Often detected on dipstick examination in an asymptomatic patient. Glomerular vs non-glomerular Provides a framework for considering pathology. Both can present with macroor microscopic bleeding (particularly non-glomerular haematuria). Always assume bleeding is non-glomerular (particularly age 40) until investigation proves otherwise.",

Is the Urine discoloured or frankly bloody? Recent trauma? May be relatively trivial, e. g. contact sports. Previous episodes? History of stone disease? Relevant medications? Anticoagulants should not cause haematuria if the INR is in the required range. Recent instrumentation of the urinary tract? Any associated urinary symptoms? Urinary infection? Pain? Sudden onset of colicky fl ank Pain suggests a stone. Suprapubic Pain may indicate infection or clot colic. 2 Painless macroscopic haematuria indicates a tumour until proved otherwise. What part of the stream? Initial haematuria suggests an anterior urethral lesion. Terminal haematuria usually arises from the posterior urethra, bladder, bladder neck, or trigone. Continuous haematuria usually originates at, or above, the level of the bladder. Cyclical haematuria in suggests endometriosis of the urinary tract. Risk factors for urothelial malignancy ( b p. 750)? Recent skin or throat infection post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Episodic macroscopic haematuria with throat infections is a classical presentation of IgA nephropathy ( b p. 544). Recent travel?

Should we screen for microscopic haematuria? X Two-thirds of physicians include dipstick examination for haematuria in health checks, but the benefi ts of screening are yet to be established. Argument for Dipstick examination is easy, acceptable to patients, and inexpensive. It may assist early diagnosis of urological malignancies (where early intervention may be lifesaving) and intrinsic renal disease (where intervention may delay or prevent progression to end-stage renal disease). Argument against Basic criteria for screening are not fulfi lled. Dipstick testing is not suffi ciently specifi c, and predictive values for both malignancy and renal disease are relatively poor. Benefi ts of early detection have not been established for either. Microscopic haematuria and the risk of end-stage renal disease A recent longitudinal study of 1. 2 million young individuals (aged 16 25) presenting for military service in Israel found an initial 0. 3% prevalence of persistent microscopic haematuria (with normal serum creatinine and proteinuria 200mg/day).

Table 1. 13 chronic kidney disease: a brief primer (see b Chapter 3) Stage Description glomerular filtration rate (milliliters per minute/1. 73m2) 1 Asymptomatic urinary abnormalities 90 2 Mild chronic kidney disease 6089 3 Moderate chronic kidney disease 3059 4 More severe chronic kidney disease (complications more likely) 1529 5 and 5D Approaching or at end-stage renal disease 15 or on Dialysis (D) Patients with a glomerular filtration rate 60mL/min should not be considered to have chronic kidney disease, unless there is concomitant evidence of Kidney damage, e. g. urinary abnormalities (proteinuria, haematuria), structural abnormalities (e. g. abnormal imaging), genetic disease (e. g. APKD), or biopsy-proven disease. Older nomenclature Uraemia (or uraemic syndrome): the constellation of symptoms and signs produced as glomerular filtration rate declines (originally chosen to imply retention of Urine in the Blood). A multisystem disorder with a complex pathophysiological basis (b p. 212). Correlation of Ur and serum creatinine with symptomatology is poor, so the diagnosis is part clinical, part biochemical. Azotaemia: a term previously popular in the USA and used to imply retention of nitrogenous compounds. Typically refers to early chronic kidney disease, sparing uraemia for symptomatic patients. Also attempts to play down the role of urea itself. End-stage renal disease (end-stage renal disease): generally defi ned as a glomerular filtration rate ≤ 5mL/min. The initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is generally required to maintain the patients continued well-being (Note: RRT does not have to wait until the patient is symptomatically uraemic, b p. 267). CLINICAL SYNDROMES: chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, AND THE NEPHRITIC SYNDROME 71 Acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) ( b Chapter 2. ) The nephritic syndrome ( b p. 536) Acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis, particularly following pharyngitis or cellulitis with group A Bhaemolytic streptococci, provides the historical prototype for this condition and remains relatively frequent in developing countries.",

Hypertension ( b Chapter 5) The Kidney has been described as both villain and victim in i blood pressure. Hypertension in renal disease Underlying renal disease is found in a minority of patients with i blood pressure, although the possibility should always be considered (an abnormal Urine dipstick provides a simple clue). i blood pressure may be a feature of any renal disease, although particularly common in glomerular and vascular diseases. Hypertension has an extremely important bearing on the progression of renal disease ( b p. 203). Renal disease in hypertension The normal Kidney plays an important role in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension ( b p. 452). The Kidney is an important site of end-organ damage caused by i blood pressure. 72 CHAPTER 1 Clinical assessment Clinical syndromes: pulmonary renal syndromes Introduction The combined presentation of an acute glomerulonephritis with pulmonary haemorrhage is one of the most dramatic scenarios in clinical medicine. Causes ANCA ve vasculitis ( b p. 640) 7 60% cases. Anti-GBM or Goodpasture s disease ( b p. 656) 7 2 0%. Also SLE (b p. 658), Henoch Sch ö nlein purpura ( b p. 650), cryoglobulinaemia (b p. 634), and rheumatoid vasculitis ( b p. 669). History The fi rst report of a condition simultaneously affecting lungs and Kidney was presented in 1919 by Ernest Goodpasture, following post-mortem studies during the 1918 19 infl uenza pandemic. Four decades later, the eponymous term Goodpasture s syndrome was adopted to describe comparable clinicopathological presentations. Subsequent realization that pulmonary renal syndromes are not a single clinical entity brought about further refi nements to the nomenclature. Goodpasture s disease is now reserved for lung haemorrhage and crescentic glomerulonephritis in the context of anti-GBM disease (b p. 656). With hindsight, it is more likely that Goodpasture s original patient had a systemic vasculitis and not the disease that now bears his name. Clinical features Acute nephritic syndrome (rapidly progressive renal failure with an active urinary sediment). Features of an underlying systemic condition may be present (e. g. cutaneous vasculitis, sinusitis, arthritis). Pulmonary haemorrhage: Cough. Dyspnoea. Haemoptysis (extensive bleeding). Anaemia (and iron defi ciency). Hypoxaemia and respiratory failure. CXR: diffuse or patchy alveolar shadowing (indistinguishable from pulmonary oedema/ARDS). computed tomography: confi rms air space fi lling. Lung function: i diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (KCO). Bronchoscopy: bloody bronchoalveolar lavage. CLINICAL SYNDROMES: PULMONARY RENAL SYNDROMES 73 Other pulmonary renal syndromes Pulmonary haemorrhage is rare, but respiratory dysfunction and/or radiological abnormalities are common in acute kidney injury.

Anuria: 100mL/24h. Polyuria Excretion of a Urine volume in excess of normal; 3L/day is an arbitrary cut-off. H O excretion is tightly controlled, so daily volumes vary widely 2 in an individual. It is usually frequency of micturition (especially overnight) s to the larger volume, rather than the volume itself, that causes the patient to present (although most patients with frequency do not have polyuria). Obtain a 24h Urine collection for volume before undertaking further investigation. Polyuria is seen in three clinically important situations (see Table 1. 14): Excessive fl uid intake. Increased tubular solute load, e. g. hyperglycaemia. Failure of the renal tubules to concentrate the Urine (Diabetes insipidus, b p. 789). Table 1. 14 Conditions associated with polyuria i Fluid loss Renal tubular Nephrogenic Diabetes insipidus, acquired tubular defect (e. g. caused by pyelonephritis, post-obstruction, chronic d potassium, i Ca2 ), nephrotoxins (e. g. aminoglycosides, cisplatin, lithium), diuretics, Bartter s syndrome, polyuric recovery phase of acute kidney injury Endocrine Central Diabetes insipidus, Addison s disease, hyporeninaemic hypoaldosteronism Osmotic diuresis Glycosuria, mannitol, contrast agents i Fluid intake Psychological Psychogenic polydipsia Oliguria Passage of a Urine volume inadequate for excretion of the end products of metabolism. 400mL/24h ( 7 20mL/h).

Is the bladder catheter blocked? 2. Is the urinary tract obstructed? 3. Are the kidneys perfused? CLINICAL SYNDROMES: Urine VOLUME AND URINARY TRACT Pain 75 Pain Loin Pain Renal Pain is usually experienced in the loin near the costovertebral angle. Anterior radiation may cause confusion with intraperitoneal Pain. May also radiate to the genitalia. Usually associated with distension of the renal capsule and described as a constant dull ache. Differential: nerve root irritation (commonly T10 T12). 2 An aggressive and a destructive renal disease may be painless. Ureteric colic Sudden onset, extremely severe (pale, distressed, unable to settle) colic.

Cystitis: signs of bladder irritability (below) and sharp, stabbing Pain towards the end of voiding (strangury). Slowly progressive distension (e. g. neurogenic bladder) may cause no Pain. Constant suprapubic Pain, unrelated to retention, may not originate in the bladder. In , consider gynaecological causes.

Several distinct clinical syndromes result from tubular defects in the context of a normal glomerular filtration rate. Generalized tubular dysfunction (Fanconi syndrome) Multiple tubular defects produce a distinct clinical phenotype referred to as the Fanconi syndrome (unrelated to Fanconi s anaemia). Components may be present to a variable degree. Causes Acquired: drugs (aminoglycosides, Sodium valproate, ifosfamide, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) and toxins (ethanol, cadmium, uranium, lead, mercury), myeloma, SLE, Sjö gren s. Mild forms of the syndrome are more common than was previously thought. Inherited: cystinosis, tyrosinaemia, fructose intolerance, galactosaemia, glycogen storage disorder type I, cytochrome c oxidase defi ciency (all autosomal recessive). There is also an autosomal dominant idiopathic form of Fanconi syndrome. Dent s disease and Lowe syndrome are X-linked Fanconi-like disorders. Features Phosphaturia and bone disease: Impaired PO reabsorption l phosphaturia l hypophosphataemia. This, and imp 4 aired 1 A hydroxylation (activation) of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in proximal tubular cells, produces skeletal 3 abnormalities, including rickets (children), osteomalacia (adults), and osteoporosis. Aminoaciduria: Amino acids are usually fi ltered at the glomerulus before reabsorption by multiple transport carriers in the proximal tubule. Fanconi syndrome l all amino acids appear in the Urine in excess. No clinically signifi cant sequelae and supplementation unnecessary. Glycosuria: Amount varies but serum glucose usually normal. Clinical sequelae are rare, though hypoglycaemia occurs in some forms (e. g. Fanconi Bickel syndrome/glycogenosis). Renal tubular acidosis (RTA): Defective bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule results in systemic acidosis (a form of type II RTA, b p. 824). sodium loss: If severe l postural d blood pressure, d sodium, and metabolic alkalosis result. Salt supplementation occasionally necessary. Hypokalaemia: i delivery of sodium to the distal tubule l sodium reabsorption at the expense of potassium excretion. CLINICAL SYNDROMES: TUBULAR SYNDROMES 77 Acidosis and renal artery stenosis activation by volume depletion also l potassium loss. Clinical sequelae common (muscle weakness, constipation, polyuria, cardiac arrhythmias) and supplementation often required. Proteinuria: LMW proteinuria is common ( B 2 microglobulin, lysozyme, and other tubular proteins), though excretion rates are usually Low moderate. Polyuria: Polyuria, polydipsia, and dehydration can be prominent. Caused by d potassium and impaired concentrating ability in the distal tubule. Hypercalciuria: Rarely l nephrolithiasis/calcinosis (? protective effect of polyuria), although these may be precipitated by treatment with vitamin D metabolites (further i urinary Ca2 ). Serum Ca2 usually normal. Isolated tubular defects Renal glycosuria d proximal tubular glucose reabsorption l glycosuria (despite normal Blood glucose). Clearance studies allow differentiation into different patterns implicating several defective tubular transport mechanisms.

The likelihood of each is infl uenced by age and sex. Presentation is with: Acute retention of Urine. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). LUTS are divided into two groups. Symptoms correlate poorly with underlying urinary pathology, so it is best to remain as descriptive as possible (see Table 1. 15). (cid: 2) Bladder outfl ow obstruction (BOO) can be clinically silent in some patients, despite signifi cant residual bladder Urine volumes and eventually progressive urinary obstruction. Table 1. 15 Symptoms of bladder outfl ow obstruction Obstructive (voiding) symptoms Storage (fi lling) symptoms Impaired size or force of stream Nocturia Hesitancy or straining Daytime frequency Intermittent or interrupted fl ow Urgency Sensation of incomplete emptying Urge incontinence Dysuria Also called irritative. Prostatism is no longer preferred to describe outfl ow symptoms (age-matched report similar symptoms). Examination Palpate for bladder enlargement; rectal examination, pelvic examination in ; examine the legs neurologically, and test anal tone/sensation. Investigations Urine M, CS, UE, and PSA (in males 40 years, b p. 772). Imaging. Bladder USS to measure residual volume post-micturition (correlation to outfl ow obstruction is poor). Urofl owmetry. Full bladder emptied into a fl ow meter to generate a fl ow curve (rate vs time). Normal max fl ow 20mL/s. Further urodynamic assessment will distinguish non-obstructive causes of Low fl ow (e. g. detrusor failure). Hypertension - fl ow studies (cystometrography). More sensitive and specifi c but invasive. Bladder and rectal catheters record fi lling and voiding bladder pressures (normograms relate Hypertension to fl ow). Videocystometrography. Fluoroscopic screening of the ureters, bladder, and urethra. Useful in the investigation of neurological bladder dysfunction. Retrograde urethrography. ? urethral stricture. CLINICAL SYNDROMES: BLADDER OUTFLOW OBSTRUCTION 79 Box 1. 11 Causes of bladder outfl ow obstruction Congenital: Urethral valves and strictures. Structural: Benign prostatic hyperplasia ( b p. 758). Carcinoma of the prostate ( b p. 766). Bladder neck stenosis. Urethral stricture. Functional: Bladder neck dyssynergia. Neurological disease spinal cord lesions, MS, Diabetes. Drugs anticholinergics, antidepressants. Prostatic enlargement (b p. 758) Prostate size correlates poorly with degree of obstruction on urodynamic assessment. Impaired fl ow is a function of two separate components: Dynamic: i sympathetic tone of prostatic smooth muscle. Static: mass effect of enlargement. 80 CHAPTER 1 Clinical assessment Renal biopsy: introduction Despite improvements in other diagnostic techniques, renal biopsy and examination of histology retain pivotal roles in nephrology.

Information concerning the activity (and potential reversibility) and/or chronicity of a previously identifi ed lesion is desirable. Preparation for renal biopsy (cid: 2) Renal biopsy is an invasive procedure. An evaluation of the risk-benefi t ratio is required in every case. Imaging: confi rm two normal-sized, unobstructed kidneys with normal parenchyma. blood pressure 160/90mmHg; preferably 140/90mmHg. hemoglobin ideally 100g/L. Normal clotting (patient and APTT 1. 2 x control). Platelet count 100 x 109 /L. Send group and save. Antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants stopped 5 days prior to procedure. Ideally, do not restart for 7 days post-biopsy. Sterile Urine. Informed consent. Give appropriate written or visual patient information. If renal impairment, the risk of bleeding increases 7 2 3-fold. Most units will have their own policy, e. g. if urea ≥ 20mmol/L (55mg/ dL) or serum creatinine ≥ 250 μ mol/L (2. 8mg/dL) or bleeding time 10min, give DDAVP 0. 4 micrograms/kg IV 2 4h pre-biopsy ((cid: 2) not if recent or ongoing angina). Contraindications Uncorrected bleeding tendency (absolute contraindication). Chronic Kidney disease with small kidneys. Multiple cysts. Suspected renal malignancy ( b p. 743). Hydronephrosis. Active urinary infection. Uncontrolled hypertension (160/95mmHg). Hypotension. Signifi cant anaemia. Uncooperative patient. Solitary Kidney (only a relative contraindication). RENAL BIOPSY: INTRODUCTION 81 Technique Performed percutaneously under LA via a posterior approach. Sedation is generally avoided, as patient cooperation is essential. Patient lies prone, with a pillow under the abdomen to straighten the spine. USS locates the kidneys, determines their size, and identifi es cysts. Either Kidney may be biopsied. A lower pole biopsy reduces the risk of piercing a major vessel. USS is used to directly guide the needle to the Kidney real time. LA is infi ltrated down to the renal capsule, using a spinal needle. Non-real-time techniques, after the kidneys have been marked on the surface, also remain in use. computed tomography guidance is an alternative when USS visualization is inadequate. Disposable TruCut needles or spring-loaded biopsy guns are generally used (e. g. 16-gauge; larger needles may i complication rate). An initial stab incision at the skin can ease passage of the needle. The patient is required to hold their breath when the needle enters the Kidney. Where possible, two cores of tissue are obtained to increase diagnostic yield. Avoid 4 passes with the biopsy needle. Call for a more experienced operator after two unsuccessful passes. Routine processing includes light, immunofl uorescence (or immunohistochemistry), and EM. Biopsy material is divided, as different fi xatives are required for the different techniques, e. g. glutaraldehyde for EM. Patient remains on bed rest, with a Good fl uid intake for 6 8h. Pulse and blood pressure are monitored regularly and Urine inspected for haematuria. The patient is advised not to undertake heavy lifting or strenuous exercise for 4 weeks. Day case biopsy is now common. (cid: 2) These should be deemed Low risk, as complications actually occur after 6 8h in 7 1/3 cases. High risk 6 not for day case: serum creatinine 200 μ mol/L (2. 2mg/dL), blood pressure 140/90mmHg, small renal sizes ( b p. 84). Open renal biopsy May be considered if the percutaneous approach carries an unacceptable risk or has been unsuccessful. Allows direct visualization of the Kidney and easier control of bleeding. More tissue can potentially be obtained. The risk of a GA may actually exceed that of a percutaneous biopsy. Laparoscopic techniques have been described.

The renal capsule is not punctured, and the risk of perinephric bleeding is reduced. High success rates demonstrated (i. e. renal tissue obtained), but complication rates appear similar. Potential uses: morbid obesity, comatose patient, uncorrected coagulopathy, failed percutaneous approach. 82 CHAPTER 1 Clinical assessment Renal biopsy: indications Clinical syndromes: when to biopsy? 2 There is no such thing as a routine renal biopsy. X Microscopic haematuria ( b p. 66) Practice varies, but most do not biopsy, unless there is associated proteinuria and/or renal impairment (either at presentation or during the course of follow-up). Isolated microscopic haematuria generally has an excellent prognosis, and histology will not infl uence management. Possible exceptions: suspected systemic condition (e. g. SLE, vasculitis), potential live Kidney donors, or for insurance or employment reasons. Proteinuria X Non-nephrotic proteinuria (3. 5g/24h) Many recommend a biopsy at modest levels of proteinuria to ensure potentially treatable lesions, e. g. primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and membranous glomerulonephritis, are not overlooked. Others argue that the benign prognosis of these conditions, when urinary Protein excretion is Low, means that a biopsy is unnecessary. Some clinicians use an arbitrary cut-off level of proteinuria to guide their decision-making (e. g. biopsy if 1g/24h urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 100mg/mmol), particularly if treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker does not reduce the proteinuria below this threshold ( b p. 61). The presence of renal insuffi ciency weighs in favour of a biopsy. Nephrotic range proteinuria A biopsy is generally recommended. Two exceptions: Minimal change disease in childhood. In this situation, an initial trial of steroids may be appropriate. Diabetic nephropathy (b p. 611). Acute nephritic syndrome The need to confi rm diagnosis and adapt treatment, according to the type and severity of the renal lesion, mandates a biopsy in the majority of cases, even when the diagnosis is suggested by serological tests (e. g. anti-GBM disease or ANCA ve vasculitis). Acute Kidney injury ( b p. 121) Unexplained acute kidney injury, particularly with an active urinary sediment (i. e. possible RPGN), or acute kidney injury that does not behave as expected, e. g. failing to recover. Chronic Kidney disease The most important determinants of the appropriateness of a biopsy are: Renal size. If 9cm, a biopsy is technically more demanding and histology is more likely to show chronic, non-specifi c, irreversible change (with the original insult not identifi able). Clinical context. A High pre-test probability may circumvent the need to obtain histology, e. g. diabetic nephropathy. RENAL BIOPSY: INDICATIONS 83 Degree of proteinuria. A treatable glomerular lesion is less likely if urinary Protein excretion is Low (e. g. 1g/24h or urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 100mg/ mmol). Systemic disease potentially involving the Kidney Immunological or serological testing ( b p. 40) may provide important diagnostic clues (e. g. ANCA ve vasculitis, anti-GBM disease), but renal biopsy will confi rm the diagnosis and assess the degree of activity and potential reversibility. This aids decision-making around the type and duration of treatment. This is particularly true of lupus nephritis where classifi cation of the renal lesion is a cornerstone of management. In some conditions, demonstrable renal involvement may be an important determinant of the need for systemic treatment, e. g. myeloma. Other important systemic conditions that often precipitate a renal biopsy include sarcoidosis and amyloidosis.",

However, less serious sequelae, such as Pain and mild bleeding, are relatively common, so it is important to explain the potential for these to the patient pre-procedure. Higher risk1 Uncorrected bleeding tendency ( 3 do not biopsy). i blood pressure (130mmHg systolic). d glomerular filtration rate, especially if serum creatinine 177mmol/L (2. 0mg/dL). Small renal sizes (10cm). hemoglobin 120g/L. Older age (40). Use of larger (e. g. 14-gauge) biopsy needle. Complications Pain: Dull ache around the needle entry point and tract is almost universal once LA effect wears off. Simple analgesia is often necessary. Severe Pain raises the possibility of a signifi cant perirenal bleed and should prompt assessment to determine the extent of the problem (as well as additional analgesia). Pain is usually short-lived but may be persistent 12h in 5%, meriting further investigation for a haematoma. Bleeding: Bleeding is the main complication of renal biopsy. Three potential sites: Collecting system ( l haematuria). Within the renal capsule ( l Pain). Perinephric space ( l haematoma). A degree of capsular or perirenal bleeding accompanies almost every renal biopsy. A hemoglobin drop ≤10g/L is common. Asymptomatic haematomas can be detected on USS in up to 30% patients. A larger capsular haematoma (Pain, signifi cant drop in hemoglobin) occurs in 7 2%. A large capsular haematoma may tamponade and compress the Kidney, causing High renin hypertension (known as a page Kidney). Transient microscopic haematuria is present in virtually all patients. Macroscopic haematuria in 7 3. 5%. Gross haematuria may cause painful clot colic 9 ureteral obstruction. Transfusion required in 7 1%. Endovascular intervention to control bleeding in 0. 6%. Nephrectomy to control bleeding in 0. 01%. RENAL BIOPSY: COMPLICATIONS 85 Arteriovenous fi stula: 7 18% on Doppler but rarely symptomatic; may cause persistent haematuria and (rarely) hypertension. Most resolve spontaneously within 12 24 months. Embolization may be an option in those that remain symptomatic. Incorrect tissue obtained: Usually muscle, fat, Liver, spleen. Colonic perforation. Perirenal infection (0. 2%). Peritoneal-calyceal fi stula. Death (0. 02%). 3 Management of signifi cant bleeding Seek expert help. Bed rest. Regular pulse, blood pressure, and O saturations (every 15min). 2 Ensure adequate IV access and commence fl uid resuscitation as necessary. Reassure the patient, and ensure adequate analgesia. Check hemoglobin, and repeat after 2, 4, 8, and 12h as a minimum. Cross-match at least 2 units of Blood, and transfuse as necessary. Repeat clotting studies post-biopsy. Correct coagulopathies. Maintain a High Urine fl ow with IV fl uids to prevent ureteral obstruction and clot colic. Consider a 3-way urethral catheter for irrigation if clot retention and bladder outfl ow obstruction. Inform surgical team. Do not move the patient for imaging until they are stabilized. An ultrasound is unlikely to be of value beyond the identifi cation of a haematoma. A contrast computed tomography may identify ongoing active bleeding, but the patient s clinical status may already imply this. If severe or persistent, consider arteriography to localize source of bleeding 9 embolization to stop it. Surgical intervention may allow control of the bleeding point, but an emergency nephrectomy may be necessary. Reference 1. Corapi KM, C hen JL, B alk EM, G ordon CE (2012).

It is characterized by retention of both nitrogenous (including Ur and creatinine) and non-nitrogenous waste products of metabolism, as well as disordered electrolyte, acid base, and fl uid homeostasis. 22 There is evidence that even relatively small acute reductions in Kidney function are associated with poorer outcomes, including increased mortality, higher risk of long-term Dialysis, and longer hospital stay. Historical limitations Despite a relative insensitivity to acute changes in glomerular filtration rate, most defi nitions of acute renal dysfunction have been based on serum creatinine, either as an absolute value or as a change from baseline. Other defi nitions have incorporated Urine output (UO) or the need for Dialysis support. A 2004 survey of 598 participants at a critical care nephrology conference revealed 199 different criteria to defi ne acute kidney injury and 90 for the initiation of renal replacement therapy. 1 This lack of consensus had implications for collection and comparison of epidemiological data, and consistency of clinical practice. The RIFLE criteria for acute kidney injury In response, the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative established a multilayered defi nition of acute kidney injury called the RIFLE criteria. acute kidney injury is stratifi ed into fi ve stages, based on severity and duration of renal injury: R isk, I njury, F ailure, L oss, and E nd-stage disease (see Table 2. 1). Many studies (0. 5 million patients) have validated these criteria. RIFLE-defi ned acute kidney injury is associated with signifi cantly reduced survival (with increasing RIFLE stage leading to greater risk of death).",

Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes acute kidney injury defi nition (2012) acute kidney injury, classifi ed by either of the earlier listed criteria, may identify slightly different patients: RIFLE may not detect 7 10% of AKIN-identifi ed cases, and AKIN may miss 7 25% RIFLE cases.

For this reason, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes have proposed the term AKD to include not only those with acute kidney injury, but also those with glomerular filtration rate 60mL/min/1. 73m2 for 3 months or a decrease in glomerular filtration rate by ≥ 35% or an increase in serum creatinine by 50% for 3 months.

Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation, 21, 690 6. DEFINITION 91 92 CHAPTER 2 Acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) Epidemiology Incidence Depends on the population studied and the defi nition used, meaning few studies historically have been able to provide accurate incidence data. However, the more recent use of AKIN/RIFLE criteria has improved this. It remains important to recognize the limitations imposed by the use of serum creatinine and Urine output for the detection of acute kidney injury. It is hoped that, in the future, sensitive biomarkers of renal cell injury will improve earlier identifi cation. Hospital 5 10% of general admissions. 20 25% of patients with sepsis and 7 50% with septic shock. 50% of all ITU admissions (where it acts as an independent risk factor for mortality of 20 60%, depending on acute kidney injury stage). Community Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes estimate a worldwide acute kidney injury prevalence of 7 2, 100 pmp, the majority of which are community-acquired. The burden of acute kidney injury may be highest in developing countries. Community-based studies in the UK (serum creatinine 300μmol/L or 3. 4mg/dL) estimate 486620 pmp. This is ageand comorbidity-related (17 pmp aged 50 and 949 pmp aged 8089). Restricting the evaluation to changes in serum creatinine, particularly large changes, will miss many cases. Individuals with chronic kidney disease are at increased risk of acute kidney injury (and acute kidney injury is a risk factor for progression of chronic kidney disease). Incidence of Dialysis-dependent acute kidney injury: 7 200 pmp annually. Prognosis 2 There is increasing evidence for the adverse outcomes associated with acute kidney injury (even after apparent resolution), including longer hospital length of stay, signifi cant complication rates (including infection), risk of chronic kidney disease (including end-stage renal disease), development of CV disease, and higher mortality. Mortality Outcomes for the new AKIN criteria by stage are shown in Table 2. 2. Prompt improvement (24h) in renal, cardiovascular, or respiratory function is associated with a better chance of survival. Outcomes for patients with sepsis in an ICU setting are linked to timely acute kidney injury resolution ( 2 indicating a therapeutic window where outcomes for these patients may be improved). Despite improvements in many aspects of clinical care (particularly nutrition and renal replacement therapy), overall mortality in acute kidney injury requiring RRT remains 50% (refl ecting a High incidence in the elderly and those with multi-organ failure). The underlying cause will play a role, e. g. lower for nephrotoxin-driven acute kidney injury (30%) vs higher for sepsisand trauma-related acute kidney injury (7 60%).",

It is also unable to differentiate pre-renal acute kidney injury from ATN. Novel biomarkers include: (i) LMW proteins that undergo glomerular fi ltration prior to reabsorption in the proximal tubule (damaged tubules l i urinary excretion); (ii) enzymes that are released into the Urine after tubular cell injury (l markers of tubular damage); and (iii) infl ammatory mediators released by renal cells or infi ltrating infl ammatory cells ( l markers of site and degree of injury) (see Fig. 2. 1). Use in clinical practice The ideal biomarker should provide additional information not available from clinical evaluation and traditional tests. The main problem to date is that studies have been performed either in defi ned clinical settings (where the timing of the renal insult is understood, e. g. after cardiopulmonary bypass, coronary angiography, or following renal transplantation) or in children (where there are no confounding comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, Diabetes mellitus, and chronic infl ammatory disease). As a result, currently available data cannot necessarily be generalized to more heterogeneous populations, such as critically ill patients in ICU. However, it is hoped that ongoing studies will demonstrate the utility of novel biomarkers to improve recognition, management, and outcomes for acute kidney injury.

Rather, it is a clinical syndrome that is caused by, or complicates, a wide range of disorders. (See Fig. 2. 2) The introduction of the new nomenclature has propagated a tendency for acute kidney injury to be conceptualized as a standard or homogenous disorder. While this may have benefi ts, clinical practice must always refl ect the heterogeneity and complexity of the syndrome and its context. The goals are to: (i) identify patients earlier when simple interventions may make an important difference to outcome; (ii) consider the multiple possible causes of renal injury; (iii) anticipate complications before they arise. Three dependable clinical syndromes can be used to help categorize acute kidney injury and 6 to direct diagnosis and therapy.

Intrinsic renal acute kidney injury The renal parenchyma itself sustains damage through injury to the renal vasculature, glomerular apparatus, or tubulointerstitium. The commonest cause (by far) is acute tubular necrosis (ATN), itself the end-product of an ischaemic or a nephrotoxic injury (b p. 106). The diagnosis of ATN implies: Glomerular, vascular, and other interstitial diseases are not responsible for acute kidney injury. Be cautious; these disorders often require specifi c treatment, and a delay in their diagnosis can have signifi cant consequences for long-term Kidney function. They may also coexist with ATN. 2 Seek expert help if you are uncertain. Recovery of renal function should occur if supportive measures are adequate (so make sure that they are adequate).

Avoid dehydration. 2. Avoid nephrotoxins ( 1 contrast, NSAIDs, aminoglycosides). 3. Review clinical (esp. volume) status and renal function if at risk. Optimize volume status preoperatively: No patient should ever go to theatre dehydrated. Review daily weights, chart input/output; check postural Heart rate and blood pressure. Calculate losses, esp. in patients NBM. 1 CVP: intermittent measurement does not correspond to volume status in many studies. Seek expert help prior to undertaking. IV fl uid replacement l use balanced crystalloid solutions unless hyperkalaemic and/or anuric (seek expert help if present) (GIFTASUP guidelines). 1 Optimize Blood Glucose control in diabetics ( l sliding scale). Optimize nutrition (with par/enteral nutrition, if indicated). Consider bladder catheter for those with prostatic disease. Avoid surgery, if possible, immediately after a contrast procedure. Stop antihypertensives (esp. diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker) for 24 48h, as blood pressure allows. Find out how the procedure and patient progressed in theatre. Check intraoperative records for Blood loss and fl uid and drugs administered. Review the patient early post-op. Consider need for level 2 and 3 care. There is no role for dopamine, furosemide, or other diuretics in the prevention of perioperative acute kidney injury. 1 M 100 CHAPTER 2 Acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) STOP acute kidney injury checklist The London acute kidney injury network (LAKIN) is a regional collaborative that aims to collate available evidence, clinical standards, and national guidelines into accessible practical advice and well-defi ned clinical pathways. The guidelines are designed for those managing acute kidney injury in general ward areas and aims to facilitate the interaction between general wards, local critical care teams, and regional Kidney unit services.

M 102 CHAPTER 2 Acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) Pre-renal acute kidney injury Any cause of a pparent volume depletion may compromise renal perfusion, as d RBF l d glomerular filtration rate. The kidneys are structurally intact but functionally compromised. As a general rule, the metabolically susceptible proximal tubule can withstand relative underperfusion (and hypoxia) for a period of days (as many as 5) before true cellular injury supervenes (ATN). (See Fig. 2. 4 for algorithm detailing sequence of events. ) Hypoperfusion Hypoperfusion is n ot the same as volume depletion. Renal perfusion is a product of effective circulating volume, cardiac output, and peripheral vascular resistance. 1 Any cause of a fall in effective arterial Blood volume (b p. 104) can cause pre-renal acute kidney injury, regardless of the hydration status of the patient: Hypovolaemia. Cardiogenic shock (or cardiac failure). Systemic vasodilatation (as in sepsis). Physiological response to hypoperfusion Systemic response Systemic hypoperfusion is sensed as a d in arterial blood pressure by carotid and arteriolar baroreceptors. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) as well as i vasopressin (ADH) release act in concert to maintain blood pressure and preserve Blood fl ow to vital organs. This is accomplished by: Vasoconstriction in dispensable vascular beds (e. g. cutaneous). i cardiac output and Heart rate. i thirst and d sweating. i renal conservation of salt and Water. Renal response (renal autoregulation) glomerular filtration rate is initially maintained because intraglomerular Hypertension is preserved despite the fall in systemic blood pressure through renal autoregulation. This is dependent on the balance between dilatation of the pre-glomerular afferent arteriole ( l prostaglandins and NO) and constriction of the efferent post-glomerular arteriole ( l mainly angiotensin II). If perfusion continues to fall, pre-renal acute kidney injury will result. As RBF drops, so glomerular fi ltration and Urine output fall as well. Below a mean arterial Hypertension (MAP) of 7 80mmHg, glomerular filtration rate d rapidly. However, lesser degrees of hypotension may provoke pre-renal acute kidney injury in susceptible individuals: The elderly. Pre-existing afferent arteriolar pathology (e. g. hypertensive nephrosclerosis or diabetic nephropathy). angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy where constriction of the efferent arteriole is blocked.

Organ cross-talk in ischaemic acute kidney injury Distant organ dysfunction has long been recognized as part of the acute kidney injury syndrome. Mechanisms underpinning this apparent systemic proinfl ammatory state include altered expression of cellular adhesion molecules, abnormal lymphocyte traffi cking, cytokine and chemokine release, and the dysregulation of immune responses. Heart: LV dysfunction associated with myocyte apoptosis, neutrophil infi ltration, and i local cytokine expression (TNFA, IL-1, ICAM-1). Lung: acute lung injury ( 2 High mortality) with i microvascular permeability resulting from various proinfl ammatory and pro-apoptotic pathways ( l downregulation of alveolar epithelial transporters, e. g. ENaC and aquaporins). Liver: infl ammation, hepatocyte apoptosis, lipid peroxidation, decreased antioxidant activity l tissue injury. CNS: confusion and encephalopathy. Neutrophil recruitment and several mediators (e. g. G-CSF and glial fi brillary acidic Protein) have been implicated in neuronal injury. 110 CHAPTER 2 Acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) acute kidney injury: recognition Introduction There is a lot to get to grips with in a patient with acute kidney injury. It occurs in the context of a wide range of underlying conditions, and the patient can be anywhere on a clinical spectrum from asymptomatic to critically unwell. You are not alone, however. 2 Consult locally agreed acute kidney injury protocols; seek specialist help early, and make use of helpful aids, such as the free smartphone app designed by London acute kidney injury network (LAKIN), or internet resources, e. g. M. Recognize the problem Patients may be asymptomatic during the early stages of acute kidney injury, despite nearly non-functioning kidneys, and may be very unwell by the time the diagnosis is apparent ( 2 emphasizing why it is so important to be familiar with High-risk patients and High-risk situations ( b p. 98)).",

Patients are often found to have i serum creatinine or d estimated glomerular filtration rate 9 oliguria at the time of their presentation, with unrelated medical or surgical conditions. Differentiating true acute kidney injury from stable (long-standing) chronic kidney disease, or even an acute deterioration of pre-existing renal impairment, is clearly very important. Much has traditionally been made of the ability to distinguish the two after initial clinical assessment and Blood tests. However, many of these features even if present are, at best, suggestive and, at worst, misleading. The only two consistently useful discriminators are: 1. Previous measurements of renal function: Where might this be documented? Can the patient remember previous Blood tests? Previous hospital admissions? Search your pathology system, and pull hospital notes. Ask the patients GP to check their records. 2. Ultrasound: Long-standing renal disease leads to loss of renal parenchyma and d renal size. Small ( 9 10cm length), echo bright, often cystic kidneys are characteristic of chronic kidney disease. 2 Normal-sized kidneys should arouse suspicion of acute kidney injury. A common exception is diabetic nephropathy ( b p. 604). Lab fi ndings suggesting acute kidney injury, rather than chronic kidney disease These are rarely as helpful as textbooks imply. Err on the side of caution (i. e. assume acute kidney injury until proven otherwise). Anaemia might suggest chronic undersynthesis of erythropoietin by scarred kidneys: a normal hemoglobin 6 argues against chronic kidney disease, but anaemia occurs in both acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. d calcium 2 and i PO suggest established chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder ( b p. 232). Not 4 so: disturbances of mineral metabolism can occur rapidly in acute kidney injury. In many situations, particularly when renal size is normal, a Kidney biopsy may be necessary to determine the nature of the renal lesion and the extent of reversibility ( b p. 121). 112 CHAPTER 2 Acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) acute kidney injury: priorities Make the patient safe Evaluate as for any critically unwell patient: airway, breathing, and circulation. The standard priorities of resuscitation initially override thoughts regarding underlying cause. 2 Does the patient require urgent level 2 or 3 care? Two additional specifi c questions must be addressed urgently: 2 How High is the potassium? 2 What is the volume status? Hyperkalaemia ( b p. 130) and pulmonary oedema (b p. 134) may prove rapidly lethal, if untreated. 3 Call for expert help. Care bundles and protocols, such as that provided by LAKIN (see Fig. 2. 8), provide a helpful framework for prioritizing management. Look for a reversible cause Once the patient is stabilized, consider the following questions, as they may identify situations where relatively straightforward interventions can have a signifi cant impact. Is it pre-renal (b p. 114)? Is the patient septic? Are there predisposing factors in the history?",

However, common sense is required. There is no role for the refl ex ordering of these in the majority of acute kidney injury (costly and require careful clinical correlation). Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) The serological hallmark of many autoimmune diseases. Further defi ned by specifi c target antigens. Where clinical suspicion is strong, the specifi c assay may be necessary despite a negative ANA (b p. 42). 1 False ve ANAs are common. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) Autoantibodies directed against components of neutrophil cytoplasm, characteristic of small vessel vasculitis ( b p. 642). Two patterns: Cytoplasmic (cANCA): antigen usually proteinase 3 (PR3). Perinuclear (pANCA): antigen usually myeloperoxidase (MPO). Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody (anti-GBM) Highly sensitive and specifi c for anti-GBM disease ( b p. 656). Anti-streptolysin O titres (ASOT) Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is the historical prototype for the acute nephritic syndrome, though incidence is falling (b p. 548). Sensitive for the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis but less so for skin infections. Protein electrophoresis (serum and Urine) Plasma cell dyscrasias: serum Protein electrophoresis (SPEP), Urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP), serum free light chains (SFLC). Immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM) Diffuse increase in vasculitis, SLE (and other connective tissue disorders), and HIV infection. Immune paresis in myeloma. Rheumatoid factor (RhF) May be ve in RA associated vasculitis (b p. 669) or cryoglobulinaemia ( b p. 634). Viral serology Hep B is associated with PAN (b p. 652), hepatitis C with mixed essential cryoglobulinaemia (b p. 686).

The key fi ndings are pulmonary oedema, respiratory infection, and pulmonary haemorrhage (all l air space shadowing that may look identical). However, additional useful information may be gathered: Cardiac contour ? LVH consistent with long-standing i blood pressure, ? pericardial effusion. Hilar lymphadenopathy, lytic lesions. Renal ultrasound 3 Perform an USS of the renal tract as soon as possible (within hours if suspected pyonephrosis). Imaging rarely makes a specifi c diagnosis but has two principal aims: To exclude obstruction ( b p. 732). To confi rm the presence of two kidneys and measure renal length. Renal length is used as a surrogate for the time course of renal impairment. Long-standing chronic kidney disease l parenchymal scarring, loss of renal volume and length. 10 11cm normal ( 6 probable acute kidney injury). 8 9cm ( 9 acquired cysts) suggests chronic kidney disease. Isotope studies in acute kidney injury Certainly not fi rst-line but (very) occasionally helpful: Acute loss of renal perfusion associated with renal artery occlusion or embolism can be diagnosed with nuclear renography (e. g. MAG 3 scan). Cortical necrosis (after severe haemorrhagic shock, particularly post-partum) will be demonstrated. acute kidney injury accompanying early vascular complications in the immediate post-transplantation setting can be evaluated. In experienced hands, recovery from ATN can be assessed, though it is rarely clinically useful. In partial obstruction, delayed transit in the ureteric phase can be helpful. ASSESSING acute kidney injury: HISTOLOGY 121 Assessing acute kidney injury: histology Role of the renal biopsy in acute kidney injury (see also b p. 82) Required in a minority of cases only. Consider once preand post-renal factors have been addressed and where non-ATN intrinsic acute kidney injury is suspected. In ATN, the prognosis for renal recovery is generally Good, and histological verifi cation will not alter management. The principal aims of biopsy are to: Establish a tissue diagnosis. Assess prognosis (is renal function salvageable? ). Guide therapy. Potential indications Unexplained acute kidney injury (initial work-up unhelpful/equivocal). Suspected glomerular disease: Haematuria 9 casts, signifi cant proteinuria, marked i blood pressure ( 1 control blood pressure fi rst). Serological or other evidence of systemic disease: For example, ANCA, ANA, anti-GBM, paraprotein. Suspected thrombotic microangiopathy (HSP/TTP). Presumed ATN persists (e. g. 2 weeks, esp. if Dialysis-dependent). Pre-existing glomerular disease. Suspected TIN/drug allergy. Suspected atheroembolic disease. Non-ATN intrinsic renal disease presenting as acute kidney injury Acute primary glomerulonephritis ( b p. 536). Systemic vasculitis affecting the Kidney ( b p. 638). Infection-associated glomerulonephritis ( b p. 548). Thrombotic microangiopathies ( b p. 574). Acute TIN ( b p. 580). Myeloma cast nephropathy ( b p. 622).

M 124 CHAPTER 2 Acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) acute kidney injury management: volume replacementwhich fl uid? Prompt fl uid resuscitation reverses pre-renal acute kidney injury. However, there is increasing evidence that fl uid overload is harmful and 6 needs to be avoided. 2 The key to achieving euvolaemia is repeated clinical assessment of a patients volume status. Which fl uid? Crystalloids See Table 2. 4 for composition of cystalloids. Isotonic saline 0. 9% isotonic remains the benchmark against which other solutions are measured. However, despite its other pseudonyms, it is neither normal nor physiological. In fact, there is evidence that it may be harmful. Excessive use of saline can result in hyperchloraemic acidosis. X Although the morbidity associated with this condition is probably Low (isotonic saline has been in use for 50 years), it has informed a move towards the use of balanced solutions. Balanced crystalloids Refer to solutions with an electrolyte composition closer to plasma. The 2009 British consensus guidelines on intravenous fl uid therapy for adult surgical patients recommended the use of balanced crystalloids over saline. Furthermore, the recent UK acute kidney injury consensus statement includes the recommendation that balanced crystalloids are used, unless patients are hypochloraemic or hyperkalaemic (balanced crystalloid solutions, such as Hartmanns and Ringers solutions, contain 5mmol/L potassium and must be used with caution). X Critics of such guidelines say that, while the move to balanced crystalloids is unlikely to cause harm, benefi ts are likely to be marginal only. Hypotonic crystalloids 0. 45% ( half normal ) saline and 5% glucose distribute rapidly throughout total body Water and are of limited use for the restoration of intravascular volume. Avoid unless true Water depletion (hypernatraemia, b p. 788). Sodium bicarbonate Weak NaHCO solutions (e. g. 1. 26% or 1. 4%) can be useful in volume-depleted, 3 acidotic (pH 7. 15) 9 hyperkalaemic patients (b p. 131). Use with crystalloid, e. g. in a ratio of 1L NaHCO to every 2 3L of NaCl. 1 Avoid stronger (4. 2% or 8. 4%) solutions, and m 3 onitor for d Ca2 . acute kidney injury MANAGEMENT: VOLUME REPLACEMENTWHICH FLUID? 125 Table 2. 4 Composition (millimoles per liter) of commonly available crystalloids Electrolyte Plasma Isotonic Example balanced (typical) saline crystalloid, e. g.

Effective volume expanders, but evidence suggests that starch-containing solutions may worsen acute kidney injury. Examples include Gelofusine and Haemaccel both gelatin-based. The use of ≥ 1000 1500mL may deplete clotting factors and i bleeding risk. Severe allergic reactions have been reported to all types of colloid. 2 The recent UK consensus statement on acute kidney injury and guidelines from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine recommends that colloid (including gelatin-based) solutions be avoided. Human albumin solutions Physiological colloid. Expensive. Although a Cochrane meta-analysis concluded that its use was associated with i mortality in the critically ill, the more recent (and well-designed) SAFE study suggested equivalence with saline (and benefi t in the subgroup of patients with sepsis).

See Figs 2. 11 and 2. 12 for guidelines on fl uid therapy and acute kidney injury complications, respectively. How much fl uid? The volume required to restore euvolaemia is the volume that improves clinical signs of fl uid depletion. These include: Reducing tachycardia. Improved peripheral perfusion. Rising blood pressure ( 2 check for postural drop, if possible). If d blood pressure, despite apparently adequate fi lling, consider cardiogenic or septic shock. Visible JVP. Improving UO. 1 Beware volume overload: i P, i blood pressure, i respiratory rate, basal lung crackles, d O sats. 2 How quickly? Resuscitation See b p. 168 for initial management of severe sepsis and sepsis-induced shock. In other situations, the aim is to infuse fl uids ( 9 Blood products) rapidly to restore blood pressure and tissue perfusion. If in doubt, trial of 200 300 mL crystalloid fast IVI, and reassess clinical parameters. Repeat, as required. Replacement If the patient is not shocked, the optimal infusion rate depends on: (i) degree of hypovolaemia; (ii) ongoing losses; (iii) whether oligo-anuric; (iv) CV status. The following is a r ough guide to getting things underway (1 slower in the elderly and in those with poor LV function): First litre over 2h, then reassess. Second litre over 4h, then reassess. Third litre over 6h, then reassess. In the face of ongoing losses (e. g. diarrhoea), input should aim to exceed measured and unmeasured (insensible, 7 30mL/h) losses by 100mL/h. If you think you may have overdone it, stop fl uids and reassess the patient. Maintenance Once euvolaemic, and assuming no other losses, match UO 30mL on an hourly basis. Insensible losses will be higher in a febrile patient. 2 Reassess the patient at least twice a day. acute kidney injury MANAGEMENT: VOLUME REPLACEMENTHOW MUCH? 127 When do you need a central line? Not often; however, bedside assessment can be problematic. Although generally straightforward when the patient is profoundly volume-depleted, it is much more diffi cult to judge when a patient is at the point of euvolaemia and 6 no longer in need of fl uid. Despite this, clinical assessment remains the cornerstone it is an important skill and improves with practice. If you are not experienced enough to assess volume status clinically, then you are unlikely to be experienced enough to use invasive monitoring correctly. If in doubt, speak to your critical care. Stand-alone CVP measurements do not correlate well with intravascular volume status (although trends following a fl uid bolus may be helpful). 2 Putting a central lines into a hypovolaemic patient is not easy and offers a signifi cant risk of complication. The UK consensus acute kidney injury statement does not advocate a CVP line for the routine management of acute kidney injury.",

Chronically hyperkalaemic patients may tolerate i potassium of 6. 0 7. 0mmol/L ( 2 but treat if 6. 5mmol/L). 1 However, an acute i potassium in acute kidney injury is much less likely to be tolerated, particularly if: (i) elderly; (ii) associated cardiac disease (esp. arrhythmias); (iii) oliguria (cannot excrete i potassium ).

The hyperkalaemic ECG ECG manifestations of i potassium are manifold (see Fig. 2. 13). 1 Mild ECG changes can progress to life-threatening disturbances very quickly. All may be exacerbated by coexisting d Ca2 and acidosis. 1 A normal ECG does not rule out cardiac instability. Peaking of T waves ( tenting ). Flattening and disappearance of P waves.

Antagonizes membrane potassium effects by poorly understood mechanisms. 10mL 10% calcium gluconate (usually 1 ampoule calcium gluconate contains 220 μ mol Ca2 /mL), or 5mL 10% calcium chloride (usually half an ampoule CaCl contains 2 680 μ mol calcium 2 /mL). Give over 2 5min. Repeat if no ECG improvement after 5min (up to 40mL calcium gluconate). Acts within minutes, but protective effect lasts 1h. 1 Can induce digitalis toxicity ( l a pragmatic approach: halve the initial dose, and give more slowly if taking digoxin). Insulin and glucose If potassium ≥ 6. 5mmol/L or ECG changes. Insulin binds to its cellular receptor and i sodium-potassium-ATPase activity, moving potassium into cells. Glucose alone will d potassium through endogenous insulin release, but insulin/glucose is more effective. 10 15IU of soluble insulin (e. g. Actrapid ) in 50mL of 50% glucose IVI over 10min (alternative: 5IU of soluble insulin in 50mL 20% glucose over 15min by syringe pump and repeated). 50% glucose is extremely viscous and irritant.

Once (if) the immediate arrhythmic danger is past, the aim should be to reduce total body Potassium to prevent further hyperkalaemic episodes. Urinary potassium wasting: diuretics Only useful in patients expected to pass Urine and 6 Urine into which potassium can be excreted. Particularly useful if coexisting volume overload. Act on the renal tubule potassium loss as one of several effects. Furosemide 40 120mg IVI as a slow bolus or 10 40mg/h to a maximum of 1000mg/day. Bumetanide offers a better absorbed oral alternative. Effect depends on onset of diuresis. Can lose substantial amounts of potassium over 24h, with a UO 2L/day. Much less effective, as glomerular filtration rate deteriorates. Gut potassium wasting: cation exchange resins Overused, particularly orally. Exchange sodium /Ca2 for potassium in the gut so actually removes potassium, rather than just redistributing it. Calcium polystyrene sulfonate (CPS) (Calcium Resonium ) or Sodium polystyrene sulphonate (SPS) (Resonium A or Kayexalate ). Can give 15g orally (supplied as a powder to be suspended in Water) up to qds or 15 30g suspended in 2% methylcellulose and 100mL Water rectally up to qds, retained for at least 2 (preferably 4) hours. May require saline irrigation through a catheter to remove the resin from the colon. Rectal route is more effective, as there is more potassium available for exchange: colonic potassium 60 90mmol/L, whereas upper GI tract 5 10mmol/L. The constipating effect of these agents given orally may paradoxically prevent potassium losses in the stool equally, the laxatives (e. g. lactulose 10 20mL tds) given with these agents may be more effi cacious than the agent itself! Modest effect seen within 24 48h. May cause colonic ulceration and necrosis (recognized with SPS when given with sorbitol as a hyperosmotic laxative previously a common practice in the USA. Post-op patients with an ileus are at highest risk). acute kidney injury MANAGEMENT: HYPERKALAEMIA 133 Extracorporeal potassium wasting: Dialysis Consider if potassium 6. 0mmol/L, or rapidly rising, and renal function cannot be restored quickly. Lowers potassium within minutes. Haemodialysis (hemodialysis) can process 20 60L of Blood against a dialysate potassium of 1 2mmol/L and is 6 a potent means of removing potassium. Haemofi ltration ( b p. 174), with returned infusate free of potassium, can achieve much the same thing although much slower. Peritoneal Dialysis is effective but rarely indicated acutely (b p. 188). Requires Dialysis access and transfer to a dialysing facility (which potentially introduces delays). 1 Never transfer a dangerously hyperkalaemic patient if they are not responding to emergency measures, speak to your ITU ( b p. 123).

Volume overload, often exacerbated iatrogenically, remains a relatively common presentation of acute kidney injury. In acute kidney injury, the Heart is often structurally normal, but salt and Water overload push it inexorably along the Starling curve. Many patients may also have poor underlying cardiac reserve ( l 1 mortality is High). Findings Cool, clammy, agitated patient. Tachycardia, tachypnoea, i JVP, i blood pressure ( d blood pressure in this context is worrying), gallop rhythm, respiratory crackles, and wheezes. Possibly: ascites, pleural effusions, and oedema.

Give IV diamorphine (1. 25 2. 5mg) or morphine (2. 5 5mg) as an anxiolytic and a venodilator ( 5mg metoclopramide as antiemetic). Can be repeated after 15min, but opiates will accumulate in acute kidney injury, so resist giving additional doses. Nitrates. If the systolic blood pressure ≥ 90mmHg, start intravenous GTN 2 10mg/h. Start Low, and titrate every 10min, as tolerated. Give 2 puffs of sublingual GTN while the pump is being set up.

Particularly marked elevations occur (early) in rhabdomyolysis ( b p. 152), tumour lysis syndrome ( b p. 160), and haemolysis (tissue injury and cell death l release of intracellular PO ). 4 Acute i PO is important because it: 4 Contributes to d Ca2 (by a poorly understood mechanism). Encourages s hyperparathyroidism. Promotes soft tissue/vascular calcifi cation. Makes the patient feel itchy, uncomfortable, and anorexic. May cause arrhythmias.

PO removal through Dialysis or haemofi ltration. 4 Oral phosphate binders (reduce intestinal absorption of phosphate): If both d calcium 2 and i PO, start calcium carbonate (usually 500mg 4 calcium per tablet) or calcium acetate (250mg calcium). If PO 2. 4mmol/L, one tablet with each meal. 4 If PO 2. 4mmol/L, two tablets with each meal. 4 If serum Ca2 ≥ 2. 4mmol/L, use a non-calcium-containing binder (e. g. sevelamer HCl (0. 8 2. 4g with meals) or Alu-cap (1 2 capsules with meals). Severe i PO is unlikely to correct until the patient dialyses or 4 recovers independent renal function. If the patient is being NG or parenterally fed, liaise with your dietitian. Hypocalcaemia Relatively common in prolonged or severe acute kidney injury. Usually in the corrected range of 1. 6 2. 0mmol/L. Caused mainly by d 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 synthesis but also by i PO. Clinical sequelae (e. g. paraesthesiae, tetany, 4 and seizures) are rare, partly because concomitant acidosis protects by increasing the ratio of ionized to Protein-bound Ca2 . 1 Rapid correction of acidosis with oral or IV HCO can precipitate symptomatic d Ca2 . 3 Calcium is supplemented orally (as Hyperphosphataemia section) the dual phosphate-binding role of calcium salts helps to make life simple.",

Metabolic acidosis acute kidney injury is usually associated with a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis: As glomerular filtration rate falls, unmeasured anions (such as HSO and HPO ) 4 4 from dietary and metabolic sources accumulate. As H is buffered, HCO is consumed. 3 The struggling Kidney is unable to reclaim fi ltered HCO from 3 the Urine (proximal tubule) or generate new HCO (through 3 production and excretion of NH ). 4 The degree of acidosis is usually modest in uncomplicated acute kidney injury (serum HCO 10, pH 7. 2) but more problematic in the critically ill where it ma 3 y contribute to circulatory compromise. 1 If unexpectedly severe, consider s cause especially lactic acidosis (sepsis, cardiogenic shock), ketoacidosis (Diabetes and alcohol), and poisoning (salicylates, methanol, ethylene glycol).

Beware bleeding especially from the GI tract and haemolysis. An hemoglobin of 7 8 11g/dL is a frequent fi nding in acute kidney injury it does not help to distinguish between acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Major contributing factors are impaired erythropoiesis ( d renal erythropoietin production), d red cell lifespan, haemolysis ( i red cell fragility), haemodilution (from fl uid overload), and Blood loss. Treatment with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent is rarely effective in acute kidney injury (b p. 220), so transfusion may be necessary, particularly if d cardiovascular reserve means d hemoglobin is poorly tolerated. See b p. 133 for Blood transfusion in oligo-anuric patients. Bleeding Acute renal insuffi ciency may be associated with a bleeding tendency s to platelet dysfunction. Uraemic toxins disrupt the interaction between platelet GPIIb/IIIa and adhesion molecules, such as von Willebrand factor (vWF) and fi brinogen. i platelet nitric oxide synthesis may also inhibit aggregation. Clinical manifestations are typically mild (e. g. spontaneous bruising, bleeding at venepuncture sites) though occasionally more troublesome ( 1 GI tract). Usually manifest if urea 25mmol/L for several days. INR, APTT, and platelet count are usually normal (if abnormal l look for other causes). The bleeding time (if measured) is prolonged. Correcting bleeding tendency The two situations that require specifi c intervention are: Active bleeding or poorly controlled persistent oozing. Prior to an invasive procedure (including renal biopsy). Management Stop aspirin, clopidogrel, anticoagulants. Correct anaemia (transfusion of packed cells). A haematocrit (hematocrit) ≥ 25 30% will help to reduce bleeding time. DDAVP (desmopressin): a synthetic analogue of ADH that probably acts by i amount of available vWF.",

It occurs in three contexts: acute kidney injury is the consequence of a specifi c infection (e. g. post-infectious glomerulonephritis, endocarditis, malaria, leptospirosis, hantavirus). Septicaemia l circulatory compromise l pre-renal acute kidney injury l ATN. Localized or systemic infection arises in those with pre-existing acute kidney injury. Approach Take signs of infection, such as fever, i WCC, i CRP, seriously as a minimum, re-examine the patient thoroughly. Culture (and re-culture) Blood, Urine, sputum, and other secretions. Make use of imaging. Repeat CXRs frequently. If the source of sepsis remains obscure, consider abdominal/chest/pelvis computed tomography. Attention to microbiological detail: chase up samples; review sensitivities; carefully consider antibiotic options, and speak to your microbiologist regularly about resistance patterns. 1 Many antimicrobials require dose adjustment in renal impairment ( b p. 878). Strict aseptic technique for central venous line, Dialysis catheter, and bladder catheter insertion. Consider prophylactic antibiotics when inserting a line or catheter into a febrile patient. Do not leave bladder catheters in place longer than necessary. In the majority of cases, accurate monitoring of UO does not require a catheter. Antibiotic cover for removal if the Urine is a likely source of sepsis. Inspect IV cannula sites regularly, and look under dressings. Remove all lines as soon as feasible. 3 Treat proven infection aggressively. 140 CHAPTER 2 Acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) acute kidney injury management: nutrition Pre-existing and hospital-acquired malnutrition l i morbidity and mortality in the critically ill. Preventing malnutrition preserves muscle function (including) respiratory, i wound healing, and i resistance to infection. General rules If pre-existing nutritional status is normal and a normal diet is likely to be resumed in ≤5 days, support is not initially indicated. If the patient is malnourished, ignore this 5-day rule and start feeding. If hypercatabolic (sepsis, trauma, burns), initiate support early. Some protocols avoid feeding within fi rst 24h: evidence that feeding during the insult phase i O requirements and worsens tissue injury). 2 Modify nutritional support as glomerular filtration rate changes and with Dialysis initiation. Do not overprescribe you can have too much of a Good thing. Enteral feeding is always preferable to parenteral (although they are not mutually exclusive). Step 1: determine the nutritional status of the patient Body weight: recent unintentional loss 10% body weight is a Bad sign. Determine body mass index (kg/height in m2 ). Normal range 20 25kg/m2. Beware fl uid retention falsely i weight. Serum albumin (30g/L is worrying), though infl ammation may be a confounder. Pre-albumin, transferrin, and cholesterol can also be used. Subjective global assessment (SGA): combines clinical parameters with albumin, anthropometry, clinical judgement, and other metrics ( b p. 258).

Energy expenditure in uncomplicated acute kidney injury is usually within the normal range, and energy requirements for those with complicated acute kidney injury are generally determined by associated disorders (e. g. sepsis).

Not recommended in Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (2012) guideline. 146 CHAPTER 2 Acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) acute kidney injury: hope for the future? Phases of ATN (see also b p. 108) There are four pathophysiological/temporal phases of ATN that can help to conceptualize where pharmacological interventions might be targeted and applied. Initiation phase Characterized by aberrant vascular reactivity, diminished renal perfusion, and widespread oxidative injury. Extension phase A proinfl ammatory state, with macrophage activation, infl ammatory mediator release, and stimulation of epithelial and endothelial cells. Maintenance phase Restoration of tubular cell integrity through the division of adjacent tubular cells and the differentiation of local (Kidney) and systemic (haematopoietic X ) stem cells. Repair phase Normal tubular cell function is restored. Very broadly speaking, therapeutic interventions can, therefore, attempt to decrease vascular reactivity, moderate infl ammation, preserve cell viability, and augment cell repair. Putative agents are shown in Table 2. 7. Many of these are currently being studied in animal models of renal ischaemia-reperfusion injury, but benefi t in human acute kidney injury is yet to be demonstrated. There are many potential reasons for this: acute kidney injury is a heterogeneous condition (both in terms of the type of patient affected and the underlying cause); study endpoints (such as mortality) are often confounded, and, until recently, there was no agreed consensus defi nition of acute kidney injury. Furthermore, late detection of acute kidney injury prevents timely administration. It is hoped that novel acute kidney injury biomarkers will facilitate earlier intervention ( b p. 94). acute kidney injury: HOPE FOR THE FUTURE? 147 Table 2. 7 Putative therapeutic strategies in acute kidney injury Pathogenic mechanism Interventions currently of unproven benefi t targeted in humans Ameliorate renal Endothelin receptor antagonists (e. g. tezosentan) vasoconstriction Leukotriene receptor antagonists PAF antagonists iNOS antisense oligonucleotides Phosphodiesterase inhibition (e. g. milrinone) Haem-oxygenases Attenuate infl ammation Anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal Ab Anti-IL-18 monoclonal Ab N-acetylcysteine, desferrioxamine, and/or other free radical scavengers A -MSH Adenosine Minocycline Corticosteroids Fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) blockade Prevention of apoptosis Erythropoietin (initial trials disappointing) and necrosis Protease (e. g. caspase) inhibitors Guanosine Pifi thrin A (p53 inhibitor) PARP inhibition Prevention of tubular Diuretics obstruction RGD peptides Promoting tubular Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) regeneration Thyroxine Epidermal growth factor Hepatocyte growth factor Osteopontin Stem cell therapy (early studies with stem cells in High-risk patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery have been promising) PAF, platelet-activating factor; RGD peptides, peptides containing the arginine glycine aspartic acid motif (involved in adhesion); ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; A -MSH, A -melanocyte-stimulating hormone; PARP, poly ADP-ribose polymerase. 148 CHAPTER 2 Acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-acute kidney injury) Introduction CI-acute kidney injury accounts for 7 10% of in-hospital acute kidney injury and is associated with signifi - cant mortality ( x5. 5 odds adjusted risk of death), prolonged hospitalization, and future cardiovascular events. It may also irreversibly d glomerular filtration rate (esp. in those with pre-existing chronic kidney disease). These adverse outcomes are worse in those who require Dialysis treatment (2-year mortality rate 80% in one study! ). CI-acute kidney injury risk is Low (7 1 2%) in patients with normal renal function (even in the presence of Diabetes) but much higher in patients with pre-existing renal impairment ( 7 25%), particularly in the presence of additional risk factors (see Box 2. 2 these factors are additive).

Concurrent nephrotoxic drug administration. High contrast volumes. Intra-arterial contrast. Precautions Specifi c measures are discussed on b p. 149. Recognize those at risk (see Box 2. 2). For ambulatory patients in whom a recent measurement of renal function is not available, a simple questionnaire may identify those at increased risk. 4, 5 Dipstick proteinuria will also help identify individuals in whom measurement of renal function is desirable. 1 Many High-risk patients may not be suitable for day case procedures. Is the procedure really necessary? Is there an alternative non-contrast technique? Speak to your radiologist. Use iso-osmolar, non-ionic contrast. Minimize contrast volume (100mL, if possible). 2 Optimize volume status pre-study. CONTRAST-INDUCED acute kidney injury (CI-acute kidney injury) 149 Stop all other nephrotoxins prior to procedure (including High doses of loop diuretics). X Although often undertaken, there is no evidence that cessation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ARBs, or metformin prior to contrast administration is protective. Space out multiple procedures whenever possible. Inform your renal team of High-risk cases (beforehand! ). Clinical features d glomerular filtration rate begins immediately (although serum creatinine may be unchanged initially). The earliest (and often only) sign may be oliguria (2 so ensure UO is being measured in High-risk hospitalized patients). i serum creatinine at 12h is the best predictor of CI-acute kidney injury. Peak serum creatinine usually occurs at 2 3d but can be delayed 5d in a minority of cases. In practice, CI-acute kidney injury often becomes apparent when renal function is rechecked the day after a procedure (so make sure it is checked and that you see the result). Although rarely (if ever) measured, fractional urinary excretion of sodium often remains 1% (unlike other causes of ATN). This fact is useful for exam purposes only. Treatment Once established, treat as for any other cause of ATN. Ensure adequate hydration, and avoid additional nephrotoxins. Standard indications for Dialysis support apply (b p. 172). Prognosis In the majority, renal dysfunction is mild and transient (although still associated with i mortality). Recovery within a week is usual. Those with pre-existing advanced chronic kidney disease are most susceptible to a permanent d glomerular filtration rate. Dialysis support will be necessary in 3 4% of those with underlying chronic kidney disease, and long-term renal replacement therapy will be required in the minority of these. Strategies to prevent RCN Hydration IV fl uids correct volume depletion and i RBF. They also minimize the pre-renal effects of a post-contrast diuresis. Evidence supporting their use is strong. Example regimens: 1. 26% NaHCO 3mL/kg/h for 1h preand 1mL/kg/h for 6h during 3 and post-procedure. 0. 9% NaCl 1mL/kg/h for 12h preand 12h post-procedure. NaHCO may have theoretical advantages over other IV fl uids through 3 an antioxidant effect (peroxynitrate scavenging), but this remains poorly defi ned and clinically unproven. Examine the patient fi rst if overtly dehydrated, then larger volumes may be required and the procedure may need to be postponed. If already volume-overloaded, then further fl uids are ill advised. Aim for a Good Urine output (150mL/h). In diuretic dependent patients, withholding diuretics may be suffi cient hydration. 150 CHAPTER 2 Acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) X N-acetylcysteine (NAC) Used for its antioxidant properties, always in conjunction with hydration.",

    "text": "Continue therapy until disappearance of urinary myoglobin. Urinary alkalinization and mannitol X The role of urinary alkalinization (stabilizes oxidizing form of myoglobin) and forced diuresis (i Urine fl ow ld tubular precipitation) remains controversial. 2 The priority is to volume-resuscitate the patient. Aim for a target u-pH 6. 5 by using alternating NaCl and NaHCO, 3 as described in previous section, but increasing the frequency of NaHCO as necessary. Evidence for a meaningful clinical impact is 3 weak, and volume overload is a risk unless Good UO. In addition, urinary alkalinization can cause a signifi cant systemic alkalosis and 6 symptomatic d Ca2 . Loop diuretics acidify the Urine and should be avoided. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, is preferred: give as a bolus (e. g. 12. 5 25g as a bolus ( 62. 5 125mL of 20% (200mg/mL) mannitol solution)) or as an infusion (10mL/h of 15 20% mannitol). 1 Mannitol l i osmolar gap and may potentially worsen acute kidney injury. Supportive care Standard indications for Dialysis apply (b p. 172), although i potassium may occur early. Physiotherapy to debilitated muscles is essential. Prognosis The prognosis is Good if the causative insult is removed, and renal function will return to normal in the majority even in those who require an extended period of Dialysis support. RHABDOMYOLYSIS: MANAGEMENT 155 Compartment syndrome in rhabdomyolysis May occur in two circumstances: If the Blood supply to particular limb has been compromised (immobility after drug overdose, seizures, etc. ). Generalized muscle injury and infl ammation (toxic, viral). Infl ammation and oedema within a closed muscle compartment l i intracompartment Hypertension ld O delivery l myonecrosis. 2 2 Always examine the major muscle groups for the characteristic woody consistency of an evolving/established compartment syndrome. Timely fasciotomy in these circumstances may save limb function. If in doubt, compartmental Hypertension can be measured via the insertion of a needle with an attached tonometer. An intracompartment Hypertension 50mmHg with a normal blood pressure, or 30 50mmHg in hypotensive patients, is suggestive. If necessary, recheck every 6h. Hypocalcaemia Do not attempt to correct d calcium 2, unless it is symptomatic (tetany, arrhythmias) there is a risk the administered calcium will precipitate in injured muscle. Rebound hypercalcaemia is common during the recovery phase. 1 Symptomatic d Ca2 may complicate NaHCO administration. 3 Haemoglobinuric acute kidney injury Occurs in the context of massive intravascular haemolysis: Transfusion reactions (ABO incompatibility). Falciparum malaria (blackwater fever, b p. 702). Haemolytic anaemias (glucose-6-phosphate defi ciency (G6PD), drug-induced, autoimmune). Mycoplasma infection. Snake, insect, and spider venoms.

Management Treat underlying disorder; volume resuscitation to establish a diuresis. 156 CHAPTER 2 Acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) acute kidney injury in cirrhosis Introduction acute kidney injury is common in cirrhosis. 7 25% patients presenting with cirrhosis-associated ascites will develop acute kidney injury within 1 year. The presence of acute kidney injury at the time of an admission increases mortality 7 8 - fold, and 50% of patients will develop acute kidney injury during an inpatient episode. 3 Not all concomitant hepatic and renal impairment is due to the hepatorenal syndrome (HRS); it is not even top of the list. Alternative diagnoses may imply a better prognosis. Always consider: Sepsis l ATN (40% of acute kidney injury in cirrhotic patients). Hypovolaemia (e. g. GI haemorrhage, diuretics) l ATN (30% acute kidney injury in cirrhotic patients).",

Also i bacterial translocation (l peritoneal infl ammatory response) and i vasoactive gut peptides (e. g. glucagons, prostacyclin). As a result, the effective arterial Blood volume is sensed to have fallen, leading to intense A adrenergic activity, s hyperaldosteronism, ANP synthesis, and non-osmotic ADH release (hence salt and Water overload). Tubular V2 receptor activation causes a dilutional hyponatraemia. An increase in cardiac output attempts to compensate, but LV dysfunction eventually results. Excess catecholamine, angiotensin II, adenosine, thromboxane A2, and endothelin l profound and intense renal vasoconstriction ( l d RBF). acute kidney injury IN CIRRHOSIS 157 The kidneys remain structurally normal, and the renal impairment is entirely pre-renal in nature t ubular integrity and function are preserved. Renal biopsies are normal (in practice, unnecessary and hazardous), and kidneys from HRS patients have been used successfully for transplantation. Clinical features 2 The diagnosis of HRS depends on exclusion of other causes of acute kidney injury. Recognition can be diffi cult, as cirrhotic patients are usually malnourished, with signifi cantly d muscle mass (6 serum creatinine may overestimate glomerular filtration rate). Urea may also be unhelpful (GI bleeding, Low hepatic production 9 variable dietary Protein intake). Cystatin C ( b p. 36) has 6 been used as an alternative. Other biomarkers (b p. 94) are awaited. Signs of advanced Liver disease: ascites (practically universal in HRS), stigmata of chronic Liver disease, portal hypertension (beware GI bleeding! ), encephalopathy, jaundice (degree variable), and coagulopathy. Cardiovascular: oedema (sodium and Water retention) and d blood pressure ( d SVR and effective circulating volume). 3 Infection: look carefully and regularly for evidence of sepsis ( 1 pneumonia, line infections, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). Electrolyte disorders: dilutional d sodium is almost universal. Nutritional state: usually poor and deteriorating. Urine output: oligo-anuria the norm in type I HRS, with Urine volumes decreasing as the condition progresses. Anuria is an ominous sign. Urinalysis bland, with no proteinuria/haematuria. Tubular function is preserved, so the kidneys excrete concentrated Urine that is Low in sodium (10mmol/L) (i. e. indistinguishable from other pre-renal acute kidney injury).

Large volume (5L) paracentesis without concurrent plasma expansion. ( X Give 100mL 20% human albumin per 1. 5L ascites removed. ) GI bleeding (variceal bleeding is a common precipitant). Overdiuresis (possibly see Box 2. 3). Sepsis: especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) (7 20% will develop HRS). 2 Any cirrhotic patient with ascites should be assumed to have SBP until proven otherwise. The administration of IV albumin 1. 5g/kg at diagnosis of SBP and 1g/kg 48h later, in addition to antibiotics, appears to decrease HRS risk. Surgery. Managing established HRS 2 Seek expert help early. Volume assessment: IV 20% albumin (salt-poor) for volume expansion (e. g. 0. 5 1g/kg/day or aiming for CVP of 5 10cmH O). 2 sodium restrict (80mmol/24h) and fl uid restrict (1L/24h) if overloaded.

Vasopressin analogues (act via splanchnic V1 receptors), e. g. terlipressin (initially 0. 5 1mg/4 6h IVI). Benefi ts: d serum creatinine, i UO, i MAP, and improved early survival. Physiological benefi ts seen early and often persist. Repeat courses can be effective. 1 Side effects: ischaemia, e. g. digital, cardiac, mesentery. Terlipressin is not available in the USA. Noradrenaline (0. 5 3mg/kg/h) is an alternative. Midodrine (7. 5 12. 5mg PO tds), a selective A agonist, may be given 1 in combination with the somatostatin analogue octreotide (100 200 micrograms SC tds). Aim to i MAP by 15mmHg. Benefi ts include improved survival although probably less effective than vasopressin analogues. MANAGEMENT OF HRS 159 Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) may improve serum creatinine in selected patients (esp. those with refractory ascites and variceal bleeding). However, there is a 5% incidence of d e novo acute kidney injury post-TIPS. N-acetylcysteine may have additional benefi ts and remains under study. Renal replacement therapy 1 RRT does not improve outcome in HRS and should be viewed as a bridge to Liver transplantation in this context. 2 However, acute kidney injury in a cirrhotic patient is not always s to HRS and may 6 be reversible.

Continuous RRT techniques ( b p. 174) may be better tolerated (less haemodynamic instability, slower correction of d sodium, and less fl uctuation in intracranial Hypertension) than intermittent hemodialysis. It has been hoped that artifi cial hepatic assist devices can be developed, following the same general principles as Dialysis for renal failure; for example, the molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) is an extracorporeal technique in which dialysate is circulated through charcoal and anion exchanger columns (removing potential HRS mediators, e. g. TNF, IL-6, and NO). Unfortunately, the diverse metabolic functions of the Liver have proved diffi cult to replicate, and results have been disappointing. Technologies under current development are based on the use of various hepatocyte cell lines to deliver synthetic Liver capacity. Liver transplantation The most (only? ) effective therapy of HRS, although many patients die before transplantation is possible. Organ allocation differs between countries, but, in many scoring systems (e. g. MELD), HRS patients are afforded High priority. 7 40% patients admitted for Liver transplantation have acute kidney injury by RIFLE criteria, and 7 70% develop acute kidney injury post-operatively (the majority of these will require renal replacement therapy). Treatment of HRS pre-transplantation improves outcomes post-transplantation, although patients with pre-transplant renal impairment have d long-term survival, compared with those with a normal glomerular filtration rate. Most patients will have improved renal function after they have recovered from surgery, although the majority do not regain a normal glomerular filtration rate ( 7 10% incidence of end-stage renal disease at 11 years). Combined Liver Kidney transplantation is an option in selected patients. 160 CHAPTER 2 Acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) Tumour lysis syndrome Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) usually occurs at initiation of treatment (chemoor radiotherapy, or even corticosteroids) of lymphoproliferative (and, less commonly, solid) malignancies but may occur spontaneously, with a large tumour burden, or at later stages of treatment. Classically, it is a complication after chemotherapy for High-blast count acute lymphocytic leukaemias, lymphoma, myeloma, or germ cell tumours. It results from treatment-induced necrosis of large numbers of purine-rich (actively proliferating) malignant cells, with intracellular and membrane products released abruptly into the circulation. Uric acid, in particular, causes acute kidney injury. (See Table 2. 10. ) Table 2. 10 Criteria for laboratory and clinical diagnosis The CairoBishop defi nition (2004) Uric acid ≥ 476μmol/L (8mg/dL) or 25% increase Potassium ≥ 6. 0mmol/L or 25% increase Phosphate ≥ 1. 45mmol/L or 25% increase Calcium 1. 75mmol/L or 25% decrease ≥ 2 of these features between 3 days preand 7 days post-tumour treatment encompasses the laboratory defi nition. A clinical diagnosis of TLS can be made if acute kidney injury, arrhythmias, or seizures occur in conjunction with the laboratory features. Cairo MS, Bishop M (2004). British Journal of Haematology, 127 (1), 3 11. Acute uric acid nephropathy Uric acid is freely fi ltered and, in excess, precipitates in the tubular lumen to form obstructing crystalline casts. This is more likely in volume-deplete patients with Low urinary fl ow rates or if u-pH d. Clinical fi ndings In the context of recent cancer therapy, symptoms and signs are due to electrolyte abnormalities ( 3 i potassium and dysrhythmias) and acute kidney injury. TLS usually occurs within 24 48h of treatment. Nausea, Vomiting, anorexia, muscle cramps, and fl ank Pain may also be present.

These are based on tumour type, disease burden, and presence or absence of renal impairment. They stratify patients to Low, intermediate, or High risk. Local protocols may vary. Pre-hydration: 0. 9% NaCl or glucose saline 2 3L/m2 ( 7 4 5L/d) for 48h preand post-therapy. Aim for UO 3L/d (preferably 2mL/kg/h). 1 Beware volume overload if renal or cardiac impairment. Diuretics may be used cautiously to maintain Urine fl ow unless persistent hypovolaemia. Prevent uric acid formation: If risk Low to moderate: allopurinol PO 100mg/m2 8-hourly (max 800mg/d) from 2 days prior to therapy ( 1 reduce dose by 50% if renal impairment). Inhibits xanthine oxidase and prevents the metabolism of hypoxanthine to xanthine (and then uric acid and its salt urate). IV allopurinol is available if oral medication not possible (200 400mg/m2 /day in 1 3 divided doses maximum 600mg/day). If High-risk for TLS, pre-emptive rasburicase (see below). Treatment of established tumour lysis Laboratory tests every 4 6h. Cardiac monitor. Consider ITU transfer. 2 Beware i potassium. 2 Beware d calcium 2 induced by i PO. Correct i PO fi rst to avoid 4 4 systemic calcium phosphate precipitation. Parenteral calcium should only be administered if evidence of neuromuscular instability and then with extreme caution. Continue volume expansion with 0. 9% NaCl, and maintain High UO. Continue allopurinol. X Alkalinize the Urine: 50mL 8. 4% NaHCO in 1L 0. 45% NaCl or 5% 3 glucose (depending on Sodium load and serum sodium ), aiming for u-pH 7. 0. i u-pH converts uric acid l more soluble urate salt, although simply maintaining adequate UO may be as effective. 1 In addition, alkalosis may promote systemic calcium phosphate deposition (shifts ionized calcium to non-ionized form), so many have abandoned this practice (unless severe concomitant metabolic acidosis). Rasburicase: A recombinant form of the enzyme urase oxidase that occurs in most species but not higher primates. Oxidizes uric acid to soluble allantoin. Rapidly d uric acid levels (within 4h; often to undetectable). Effective at preventing tumour lysis syndrome. Usually given as 200 micrograms/kg IVI over 30min daily for 5 7 days, although shorter protocols (including single dose) have been developed (it is expensive). 1 Avoid if G6PDH-defi cient. No adjustment required in renal impairment. SE: rashes, GI upset, headache. Institute intermittent haemodialysis early if oliguric or uncontrolled electrolyte abnormalities. Aim for High Dialysis clearances with daily treatments.

    "text": "Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) describes the syndrome of organ (including renal) dysfunction s to IAH. It is most often seen in an HDU/ICU setting where it may be diffi cult to diagnose amongst the complications of a primary disease. Causes p ACS: disease/injury within the abdomen (e. g. trauma, surgery, ascites, bowel distension, intraperitoneal bleeding, Liver transplantation, retroperitoneal disease including AAA, pancreatitis). s ACS: disease/injury outside the abdomen (e. g. sepsis, burns, aggressive fl uid resuscitation). Estimates of prevalence vary widely, e. g. 1 15% in the context of traumatic injury. Consequences ACS can affect virtually organ system: CV: d venous return l reduced cardiac output. Respiratory: d chest compliance l respiratory compromise and i infection. GI: d mesenteric Blood fl ow l bowel ischaemia. Venous congestion l gut oedema. Bacterial translocation l sepsis.

Clinical presentation Abdominal Pain, tenderness, bloating and distension, breathlessness (or i ventilatory requirements), i pulse, d blood pressure, i JVP, d UO, peripheral oedema, lactic acidosis. Diagnosis Diagnosis requires recognition of at-risk patients and situations with appropriate measurement of the IAP. ABDOMINAL COMPARTMENT SYNDROME (ACS) 163 IAP can be measured indirectly, using intra-gastric, intra-colonic, IVC, or intra-vesical (most common) catheters. The World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome recommends the latter (see Fig. 2. 15). Commercial devices are available, although a Hypertension transducer connected to a standard Foley catheter is often used. Imaging is non-diagnostic. Management Supportive care 9 surgical decompression: Supportive care: adequate analgesia, sedation, and muscle paralysis (with ventilatory support); consider NG and rectal decompression; accurate fl uid management; nurse in supine position. Surgical decompression: early intervention as IAP rises (and prior to development of ACS) is increasingly advocated. The most common technique is midline decompression, leaving an open abdomen. Patients should be screened for IAH/ACS risk factors upon ICU admission and with new or progressive organ failure. If two or more risk factors are present, a baseline IAP measurement should be obtained If IAH is present, serial IAP measurements should be performed throughout the patients critical illness.

    "text": "This may vary down to a regional level, depending on socio-economic and environmental factors. However, basic pathophysiological and management principles still apply. Epidemiology Cases are underreported, so accurate epidemiological data are scarce. However, community-acquired acute kidney injury is more common (estimate 7 150 pmp) and affects a younger age group (mean age 37 in one study from southern India). Mortality rates are also higher and more dependent on local resources. There may be less access to RRT in some areas, with peritoneal Dialysis more commonly employed for this purpose (b p. 188). Overall, medical causes of acute kidney injury, such as sepsis, predominate; however, cases related to surgery are rising, as increasing numbers of procedures are undertaken in older, more comorbid patients. Fortunately, obstetric-associated acute kidney injury is in fairly rapid decline in most areas. Causes Infective causes of acute kidney injury Diarrhoeal disease: Common cause of pre-renal acute kidney injury and ATN (and HUS see further in list). Children with diarrhoea are much more susceptible to acute kidney injury (diarrhoea causes 7 50% of Dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury in Indian children). Viral causes: rotavirus and Norwalk agent. Bacterial causes: E. coli, Shigella spp. , Salmonella enteritides, V ibrio cholera, Campylobacter jejuni, P seudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae. Treatment is supportive ( l directed at fl uid and electrolyte imbalances) 9 antimicrobials for specifi c infections. Diarrhoea-associated (D) haemolytic uraemic syndrome ( b p. 578) is common in paediatric practice internationally. It is most commonly associated with Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 but has many other precipitants. Malaria ( b p. 702). Leptospirosis: Leptospira interrogans is a spirochaete that infects many mammalian species and is shed in Urine. Illness classically follows a biphasic course, with an initial febrile illness, followed by more fulminant disease with Liver involvement. acute kidney injury occurs in 7 50% of severe cases. Associated acute kidney injury may be pre-renal/ATN, but an interstitial nephritis (with marked urinary potassium wasting) is also common. Diagnose with serology (late) or antigen detection via protein-creatinine ratio (early). Treatment is supportive, plus penicillin, doxycycline, or 3rd-generation cephalosporin (e. g. ceftriaxone). acute kidney injury IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD 165 HIV (b p. 676): acute kidney injury usually s to HIV-associated infection or HAART-related nephrotoxicity, but many other renal lesions are recognized.

Renal micro-abscesses are common. Viral haemorrhagic fevers: Severe multisystem illnesses (including Dengue, Yellow, Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa fever) caused by 12 RNA viruses from four families (fl avi-, arena-, bunya-, and fi lovirus). Haemodynamic instability and increased vascular permeability l ATN. Also rhabdomyolysis. Proteinuria is common. Hantavirus is discussed on b p. 73. Non-infective causes Herbal or traditional medicines are a common part of healthcare in many developing countries ( b p. 901). Surgical acute kidney injury: Incidence steadily increasing with the growth of surgical specialties and facilities across the globe. Includes perioperative acute kidney injury and post-operative complications. Trauma. Obstructive uropathy is increasing (ageing population, particularly ). Pregnancy-related acute kidney injury is declining, with fewer illegal abortions and better access to Good antenatal care. Glucose-6-phosphate defi ciency (G6PD): Affects several hundred million people worldwide, mainly in the Mediterranean, Africa, Middle and Far East. Intravascular haemolysis occurs, following signifi cant oxidative stress (e. g. infections, drugs). Haemoglobinuric acute kidney injury results ( b p. 155).

Chemicals: The incidences of acute kidney injury s to poisoning with copper sulphate (leather industry), formic acid (rubber industry), and paraquat (agriculture) are now falling. 166 CHAPTER 2 Acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) acute kidney injury in sepsis What is the sepsis syndrome? Sepsis accounts for 2% of all hospital admissions but 25% of admissions to ITU. acute kidney injury is a frequent complication of the sepsis syndrome, increasing in incidence as the severity of sepsis increases. Patients whose renal failure is sepsis-related have a mortality of up to 75%. With sepsis, there is evidence of (usually local) infection, with systemic signs of infl ammation ( i temperature, i heart rate). This progresses to the sepsis syndrome if organ dysfunction ensues typically, confusion, oliguria, hypoxia, and acidosis. Full-blown septic shock implies hypotension, despite adequate volume resuscitation, with signs of organ dysfunction. Causes of signifi cant sepsis Gram ve organisms: Staphylococci (incl. S. aureus, MRSA, and S. epidermidis ) 20 35%. Streptococcus pneumoniae 10%. Other Gram ve 10 20%. Gram ve organisms: E. coli 10 25%. Other Gram ve (commonly Pseudomonas ) 5 20%. Others: Fungi ( Candida) 3%, viruses 3%, parasites (malaria) 1 2%. How sepsis becomes shock Engulfed pathogens are lysed, liberating membrane products (including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and exotoxin), proteins, and DNA. These fragments are recognized by specifi c cellular receptors (Toll-like receptors) which l NF κ -B-dependent cell activation. Activated cells then release proinfl ammatory mediators (e. g. IL-1, TNF, IFN), stimulating local and systemic host defence networks. Systemically activated leucocytes now orchestrate the immune response, with local leucocyte recruitment into infl amed tissue encouraged. At the same time, anti-infl ammatory and resolution pathways (negative feedback) are induced; inappropriate regulation of these pathways often leads to a deleterious prolongation of systemic infl ammation. Within infl amed tissue, and eventually systemically, the endothelium upregulates cellular adhesion molecules and tissue factors to encourage recruitment of effector cells. Inducible nitric oxide synthase generates large quantities of NO, and the integrity of intracellular tight junctions is compromised. The consequences are reduced microvascular fl ow and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to organ failure. acute kidney injury IN SEPSIS 167 Clinically, this translates into d systemic vascular resistance (NO is a potent vasodilator and renders angiotensin II and adrenaline less effi cacious). i capillary leakiness (tight junctions impaired). Local tissue injury (neutrophil recruitment with elastase release and oxidant burst). i sympathetic activity. renal artery stenosis activation: A2 l vasoconstriction.

    "text": "Indications Since evidence is currently lacking, it is principally a matter for clinical judgement, based on the patients clinical condition, trends in laboratory tests, and the potential for swift recovery of renal function. The indications are distinct from those applied to chronic kidney disease. In general, the clinician must carefully consider what goals they want to achieve with RRT in an individual patient with acute kidney injury. Absolute indications 3 Hyperkalaemia: There is no universally agreed potassium concentration. A helpful rule: consider urgent Dialysis if potassium ≥ 6. 5mmol/L or rapidly rising, regardless of ECG changes (particularly if not responding to other interventions, such as insulin and glucose). 3 Volume overload: Pulmonary oedema in an oligo-anuric patient with an inadequate response to diuretics. Volume status is an important determinant of outcome in acute kidney injury and should be afforded a High priority in this setting. The remaining indications for Dialysis are u rgent, rather than emergent. This can be an important distinction depending on local resources, it may be preferable to delay Dialysis and perform it as a planned daytime procedure under adequate supervision and with multidisciplinary support. When to start RRT There is limited evidence to support an earlier start to RRT in acute kidney injury, e. g. at lower values of urea (25 30mmol/L or 7085mg/dL), the onset of oliguria, and certainly well before classical indications supervene. However, the benefi ts of this practice (in terms of survival, duration of acute kidney injury, and renal recovery) are not clear-cut. Clinicians have a general tendency, perhaps extrapolated from their chronic kidney disease care, to wait as long as possible before Dialysis initiation. The recent Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines sensibly recommend a pragmatic approach and to consider the broader clinical context, the presence of conditions that can be modifi ed with RRT, and trends of laboratory tests rather than single Ur or serum creatinine thresholds alone . RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY IN acute kidney injury 173 Relative indications Acidosis (pH 7. 2), especially if haemodynamically unstable, or where volume overload precludes IV bicarbonate administration. There is evidence that myocardial enzymes are dysfunctional with pH 7. 2 l higher risk of arrhythmia. Critically unwell patients (usually in an HDU/ITU setting): To maintain fl uid balance and allow safer administration of fl uid, feeding, Blood and Blood products, antimicrobials, and drugs. Uraemic complications: Rare for these to be a signifi cant factor in acute kidney injury. If you are waiting for these before initiating Dialysis, then you are waiting too long! Uraemic pericarditis or encephalopathy. Uraemic symptoms, especially once Ur 40mmol/L (112mg/dL) (1 there is no absolute fi gure that equates with uraemia, and there is considerable interpatient variation in biochemical tolerability ).

Why delay RRTthe potential complications Complications of Dialysis access insertion ( b p. 180). Haemodynamic strain or overt hypotension in an already sick patient ( X which may then perpetuate acute kidney injury). Electrolyte imbalances, e. g. rapid reduction of potassium ( 1 l arrhythmias). Complications of anticoagulation ( b p. 182). Dialysis disequilibrium ( b p. 177). When to stop RRT Requires regular (at least daily) assessment. Average duration of RRT in acute kidney injury is 7 12 days. Assessment of underlying renal function during RRT can be diffi cult.

    "text": "An increase in Urine output is particularly helpful, although the use of diuretics will need to be factored in (routine administration of diuretics to i UO and facilitate earlier cessation of RRT is not recommended). Trends in serum creatinine, Ur, and electrolytes need to be carefully considered (and allowance made for non-renal confounding factors, such as the patients catabolic state and volume status). Theoretically, serial measurements of urinary creatinine excretion might be helpful but are very rarely undertaken in practice. Cessation of RRT does not have to be an absolute. It might be prudent to initially adjust the duration and frequency of treatment or to consider a modality change (e. g. step down from CRRT on ITU to IHD on a renal unit). On occasion, particularly in a critical care setting, more fundamental issues concerning the futility of further treatment will need to be included in the decision-making. 174 CHAPTER 2 Acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) RRT in acute kidney injury: modalities Introduction The ideal modality of RRT in acute kidney injury is unknown. In practice, the choice will be based primarily upon: (i) the availability of different treatments and (ii) a patients haemodynamic status and overall clinical condition. peritoneal dialysis use in acute kidney injury is infrequent, except in paediatric practice and in areas where resources are constrained (b p. 188). The treatments are not mutually exclusive, with changes between them dictated by clinical circumstances. Modalities Generally, intermittent haemodialysis (IHD) is preferred on renal units whilst continuous techniques (CRRT), such as continuous veno-veno haemofi ltration (CVVHF), continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD), continuous veno-veno haemodiafi ltration (CVVHDF), and sustained Low-effi ciency Dialysis (SLED), are more often encountered in High dependency and critical care environments. Intermittent haemodialysis (IHD) (see Fig. 2. 16 ) Solute clearance mainly by diffusion across semi-permeable membrane. Pores in the membrane allow small molecules (e. g. Ur (MW 60Da), creatinine (113Da)) and electrolytes but not larger ones (e. g. plasma proteins (albumin 60, 000Da, IgG 140, 000Da) or Blood cells) to pass through. Dialysate (physiological solution of electrolytes) is required. Concentration differences across the membrane allow molecules to diffuse down a gradient. This allows waste products to be removed and desirable molecules or ions (e. g. HCO ) to be replaced. 3 Diffusion is maximized by maintaining High-fl ow rates of Blood and dialysate and by pumping the two through the dialyser in countercurrent or opposite directions. Usually administered intermittently (e. g. 4h, 3 x /week), although the delivery in acute kidney injury may differ from this ( b see chapter 4). Water can be driven through the membrane by hydrostatic force (ultrafi ltration or ultrafiltration). The Hypertension gradient across the membrane (transmembrane Hypertension or TMP) can be controlled to vary the amount of Water removed (but usually 3 4L in a 4h treatment). Haemofi ltration (heart failure) (see Fig. 2. 16 ) Solute clearance by convection (mainly), i. e. fl uid shifts across the Dialysis membrane also allow solutes to cross ( solute drag ). Achieved by generating a TMP across the membrane. Large volumes need to be fi ltered to achieve adequate solute clearance. This would cause hypovolaemia, unless replacement fl uid is administered usually pre-prepared 5 10L bags (during IHD, heart failure is used to remove fl uid that has accumulated between treatments 6 no fl uid replacement is necessary). No dialysate is required. Removes larger MW (30 50kDa) molecules (e. g. vitamin B12 and B 2 microglobulin) more effi ciently than Dialysis. X May also remove pro- (and anti-) infl ammatory cytokines.

Introduction One size does not fi t all. No single modality of RRT is ideal for all patients in all situations. It is 6 important to be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of available techniques and to tailor treatment to a particular clinical context. The treatments should not be considered competitive but complementary. It should also be acknowledged that availability may infl uence choice to a greater or lesser extent. Advantages and disadvantages CRRT Advantages: slower fl uid removal ( l haemodynamic stability); continuous ( 6 improved) fl uid balance (including greater overall capacity for fl uid removal); gentler solute control ( l slower fl uid shifts and d risk of cerebral oedema); adjustable as clinical circumstances evolve; relatively simple equipment. Disadvantages: continuous anticoagulation (b p. 182); immobilized patient; risk of hypothermia; potential higher cost. IHD Advantages: faster correction of electrolyte abnormalities and toxin removal (6 potential advantage for i i potassium, poisoning, tumour lysis, rhabdomyolysis); rapid fl uid removal; allows mobilization (l less muscle wasting and respiratory infection) and time for other investigations and interventions to take place; fewer bleeding complications; transfer to a High dependency environment is usually unnecessary; several patients can be treated with the same equipment each day; possible reduced cost. Disadvantages: haemodynamic instability; Dialysis disequilibrium ( b p. 177); less overall control of fl uid balance and less adaptability; technically more complicated. Hybrid treatments The aim of treatments, such as SLED, is to share the advantages whilst minimizing disadvantages of both CRRT and IHD. Evidence Several RCTs have compared CRRT to IHD in the context of acute kidney injury. However, a clear demonstration of the superiority of either technique has proved elusive, e. g. a Cochrane collaboration meta-analysis analyzed 15 studies involving 7 1500 patients and concluded that outcomes were similar in terms of mortality, length of hospital stay, and renal recovery.",

    "text": "X An often debated benefi t of CRRT is a favourable effect on renal recovery (as a by-product of improved haemodynamic stability). However, whilst reduced progression to end-stage renal disease has been suggested by a few observational studies, all controlled trials and meta-analyses to date have failed to demonstrate a consistent benefi t of CRRT. Comparative studies between SLED and CRRT demonstrate similar outcomes, particularly with respect to haemodynamic tolerability. RRT IN acute kidney injury: CHOOSING MODALITY? 177 General guidance In the patient with haemodynamic instability, CRRT is preferred to standard IHD. CRRT is also preferred in patients with acute kidney injury who cannot tolerate fl uctuations in fl uid status (e. g. cardiogenic shock). In a critically ill patient with multi-organ involvement, particularly in an HDU/ITU setting, the adaptability of CRRT means that it is generally preferred to IHD. CRRT is preferred for a patient with acute brain injury where IHD may worsen neurological status (d blood pressure cerebral oedema l d cerebral perfusion Hypertension). CRRT is preferred in combined Liver-Kidney failure (possible advantage for prevention of i intracranial Hypertension). SLED may be better tolerated than IHD, particularly if other forms of CRRT are unavailable. Dialysis disequilibrium A syndrome thought to be s to cerebral oedema: Blood Ur drops rapidly during Dialysis but slower both in the intracellular compartment and within the Blood brain barrier. This results in Water infl ux into the brain and cerebral oedema ( 9 cerebral acidosis). Usually occurs in the context of acute kidney injury on a background of chronic kidney disease. 3 Rare if fi rst Dialysis prescription/precautions observed ( b p. 178). Those with Ur 60mmol/L (168mg/dL) at particular risk. Symptoms (during or shortly after Dialysis): nausea, dizziness, headache, visual disturbance, agitation, confusion, d GCS, and seizures. 2 Exclude hypoglycaemia, d sodium, drug toxicity (has a renally excreted drug stayed at the same dose despite a dramatic reduction in Kidney function, e. g. antibiotics? ), and intracerebral bleeding. Prophylaxis: observation of fi rst Dialysis prescription/precautions is mandatory. Phenytoin 15mg/kg loading dose, then 200 300mg/d, is no substitute for applying these but has been used. Treatment: stop Dialysis, and supportive care (improvement should occur within 24h). Seizures: mannitol 10 15g IV (raises plasma osmolality) and diazepam 9 phenytoin. 178 CHAPTER 2 Acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) RRT in acute kidney injury: prescription 2 Remember: the Dialysis staff have considerable expertise and are likely to know a great deal more than you can possibly learn from this book. Intermittent hemodialysis Time: 1 Rapid overcorrection of uraemia may cause the syndrome of Dialysis disequilibrium ( b p. 177), so initial treatment aims for partial correction of uraemia only ( d Ur ≤30%). A guide: 1st session l 2h, 2nd l 3h, and subsequent l 3 4h. Blood fl ow: Relatively slow, 7 150 200mL/min (i by 50mL/min/session to 300 400mL/min). Frequency: Ur rebound is common, so aim to dialyse daily against symptoms and chemistry ( 1 beware i potassium ) for the fi rst 2 4d. Catabolic patients (e. g. sepsis) may need to remain on a daily regimen for longer. Dialyser: Small dialyser (≤1. 2m2 ) preferable ( b p. 284). Fluid removal or ultrafi ltration (ultrafiltration): 2 Assessment of volume status is crucial. Hypovolaemia: administer saline (e. g. 1 2L) prior to, and during, Dialysis no ultrafiltration. Euvolaemia: no ultrafiltration. Overload: up to 2 3L can be removed over 2h, depending on haemodynamic status, progress and stability of the patient.",

RRT IN acute kidney injury: PRESCRIPTION 181 Adequacy (dose) The optimal dose of RRT in acute kidney injury (and how best to measure it) is unknown. In addition, the actual d elivered dose of RRT often falls short of that intended or prescribed (reasons: haemodynamic instability, variations in body mass index, access malfunction, technical diffi culties, fi lter or dialyser clotting, and patient disconnection, e. g. for other interventions or investigations). Measurement Although routinely used for the assessment of Dialysis adequacy in chronic kidney disease ( b p. 286), dialysis adequacy measure for urea has less utility in acute kidney injury where patients are more metabolically unpredictable, particularly with respect to urea production. Many clinicians aim for a consistent Blood Ur (post-Dialysis Ur for IHD), e. g. 25mmol/L or even 15mmol/L. Overall, the goals of RRT prescription in acute kidney injury should 6 be more holistic, aiming to achieve the optimum electrolyte, acid base, and fl uid balance that are appropriate for a particular clinical circumstance. This may require continuous reassessment and adjustment. Guidelines There is currently no evidence that increased RRT dose in acute kidney injury improves outcomes with respect to either mortality or renal recovery. However, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes recommended the following: IHD: a cumulative weekly dialysis adequacy measure of 3. 9, e. g. dialysis adequacy measure 1. 3 for each treatment on a 3 x /week Dialysis prescription. CRRT: fi ltration volume of 20 2 5mL/kg/h. For the reasons given earlier, this is likely to require a prescribed dose in the range of 25 30mL/kg/h. High-dose RRT in sepsis X There has been interest in High-dose RRT in the context of acute kidney injury and septic shock. It is postulated that removal of proinfl ammatory cytokine removal might be important. Limited data suggest potential benefi t, particularly in terms of the vasopressor doses required to maintain MAP in these patients. In the IVOIRE trial, there was no evidence that High volume heart failure at 70mL/kg/h, compared with contemporary standard volume heart failure at 35mL/kg/h, leads to a reduction in 28-day mortality, or contributes to early improvements in haemodynamic profi Blood or organ function. Cytokine removal may not only be through ultrafiltration, but also via adsorption on the fi lter membrane (potentially increasing costs, as the fi lter becomes cytokine-saturated and requires regularly changing). It seems likely that anti-infl ammatory cytokines are just as likely to be removed as their proinfl ammatory counterparts. High-dose CRRT means fi ltration volumes in the range of 65mL/kg/h. Cytokine removal can also be achieved with IHD and SLED, using special High-fl ux (i. e. large pore size) membranes.",

This reduces treatment effi ciency and causes Blood loss. Prevention requires concomitant anticoagulant therapy, which introduces a bleeding risk and increases technical complexity. (See Fig. 2. 18) Patient factors Anticoagulant therapy can be individualized to the patient. Patients with pre-existing coagulation issues (e. g. thrombocytopenia, Liver disease) will be at higher risk from therapeutic anticoagulation. acute kidney injury patients may already be anticoagulated for an underlying condition (e. g. ACS, atrial fibrillation) and 6 not require additional treatment. If anticoagulation is not possible, other measures (and nursing skill) can prevent or delay thrombosis, e. g. satisfactory vascular access, pre-fi lter fl uid replacement for CRRT, regular saline fl ushes, i Blood fl ow, and immediate attention to equipment alarms. Intermittent haemodialysis Unfractionated heparin Remains the most widely used anticoagulant for IHD (see also b p. 290). Dose and target ACT/APTT can/should be patient-specifi c. Advantages: vast experience with use; widely available; short half-life; reversible with protamine; tests required for monitoring (APTT, ACT) are usually readily accessible; relatively Low cost. Disadvantages: narrow therapeutic index; drug kinetics often unpredictable; HIT; heparin resistance ( s to d antithrombin levels in the critically ill), (). LMW heparin Use in acute kidney injury has increased, as experience has grown in chronic IHD. 1 LMWH relies on renal elimination, so acute kidney injury patients are at i risk of accumulation and bleeding ( b p. 138). Doses lower than those familiar from therapeutic anticoagulation, e. g. enoxaparin (0. 5mg/kg) single bolus at start of IHD. 1 Caution if patient also receiving LMWH for thromboprophylaxis (consider combining at the start of Dialysis to achieve two goals). Intermittent measurement of anti-factor Xa activity desirable with prolonged, or daily, use. Advantages: simple regimen; more predictable drug kinetics; consistent anticoagulant effect; less monitoring usually necessary; d risk of HIT. Disadvantages: accumulation; measurement of anti-factor Xa activity may not be available; incomplete reversal by protamine; higher cost.

RRT IN acute kidney injury: ANTICOAGULATION 185 186 CHAPTER 2 Acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) RRT in acute kidney injury: citrate regional anticoagulation Citrate regional anticoagulation is an increasingly popular means of anticoagulation for CRRT. (See Fig. 2. 19) Citrate forms a complex with ionized calcium (iCa2 ), thereby eliminating a crucial constituent of the coagulation cascade. Citrate reaching the systemic circulation is metabolized (Liver, muscle, Kidney), releasing calcium and generating bicarbonate. Low or zero calcium dialysate/replacement solutions are required, and separate calcium infusions prevent d Ca2 . Advantages: d bleeding; d transfusion requirement; longer circuit patency; generation of HCO. 3 Disadvantages: citrate accumulation l acidosis; d Ca2 (esp. Liver impairment or shock); d magnesium (citrate binds to magnesium); risk of metabolic alkalosis; i sodium (trisodium citrate); technically much more complicated. Procedure Citrate (e. g. 4% trisodium citrate) is infused into the arterial side of the haemofi lter circuit, for example: 90mL of stock 46. 7% trisodium citrate in 1L 5% dextrose. Infused at 175 350mL/h, depending on Blood fl ow. Different protocols use different concentrations of calcium, e. g. 0. 75% calcium chloride infused concomitantly into central vein: 80mL of 10% calcium chloride in 1L normal saline. Infuse at 7 60mL/h. Circuit and systemic total and iCa2 are measured hourly until stable and then 4 6h. Aim to maintain circuit iCa2 0. 25 0. 35mmol/L and systemic iCa2 0. 9 1. 23 millimoles per liter. Titrate citrate infusion to circuit iCa2 and calcium infusion to systemic iCa2 .

Until recently, it was also the most popular technique for the treatment of acute kidney injury in children. Potential advantages No need for a specialist renal set-up. Technical aspects and apparatus are relatively straightforward. Minimizes haemodynamic instability (making fl uid removal easier). Gentle correction of biochemical abnormalities. No need for vascular access or systemic anticoagulation. Glucose in peritoneal dialysis fl uid increases caloric intake. Low cost. Potential disadvantages Bowel perforation during catheter insertion (esp. if previous surgery l adhesions). 1 Infection: peritonitis and catheter exit site. Poor clearance: relatively slow correction of uraemia and i potassium, particularly in catabolic patients. Unpredictable ultrafiltration rate (interpatient variability). Protein and amino acids lost in dialysate. Catheter problems: migration, poor infl ow/outfl ow, leakage. Abdominal distension l diaphragmatic splinting l respiratory compromise. Hyperglycaemia (peritoneal dialysis fl uid uses glucose to generate hypertonicity). Contraindicated by recent abdominal surgery. Diaphragmatic splinting with respiratory compromise. Catheter placement Semi-rigid (stab peritoneal dialysis) Pros: inserted at the bedside under LA (usually via a Seldinger technique). Cons: non-cuffed, therefore, High infection rates. Uncomfortable and easy to dislodge. Higher incidence of bowel perforation. Usually requires removal after 48 72h ( l repeated insertions often necessary). Cuffed catheter (similar to those used in chronic peritoneal dialysis) Pros: cuff prevents bacterial migration 6 d infection rates. Softer catheter so more comfortable with less risk of bowel perforation. More compatible with automated cyclers. Cons: insertion requires more expertise (although LA still possible). PERITONEAL Dialysis (peritoneal dialysis) IN acute kidney injury 189 peritoneal dialysis vs IHD or CRRT for acute kidney injury? Studies are limited. Comparisons have suggested a worse outcome for peritoneal dialysis than for CVVHF t hough second-rate peritoneal dialysis equipment (rigid catheters, home-made fl uids, acetate buffer, no automated cyclers) are often judged against fi rst-rate CVVHF technology in highly catabolic patients. However, peritoneal dialysis cannot be considered a front-line treatment for acute kidney injury in most settings but may be lifesaving if hemodialysis/CRRT unavailable. Prescribing acute peritoneal dialysis Commercially available dialysate solutions preferable. Warm to body temperature prior to infusion. A correctly positioned catheter should allow infl ow and outfl ow times of 10 15min. Both proceed under gravity. Ensure complete drainage (remember: more drains out than in if ultrafiltration has occurred). Dwell times of 1h are typical (30min a waste of time and effort). With non-cuffed rigid catheters, peritonitis risk i dramatically after 72h. Cuffed catheters offer uninterrupted treatment. Aim for 20 24 exchanges/day (although often logistically diffi cult). Record the number of exchanges and fl uid input: output. Continuous equilibrium peritoneal dialysis (CEPD), which is similar to standard continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, is an alternative. Dwell times are 4 6h, allowing more time for solute equilibration between Blood and dialysate. Less time hands on the catheter ld risk of infection. Dialysate volume: most patients tolerate 2L exchanges. Larger volumes (up to 3L) can l catheter leaks, hernias, and diaphragmatic splinting. Dialysis dose is increased by i dialysate volume 9 i exchange frequency. Fluid balance. If the patient is euvolaemic, mildly fl uid-overloaded, or haemodynamically unstable, a 1. 5% dextrose concentration ( light bag ) is appropriate. Check the subsequent drainage volume to assess ultrafiltration. Use this fi gure, in combination with repeated clinical assessment, to direct the need for higher dextrose concentrations (usually 2.",

    "text": "Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 89mL/min without Kidney damage do not have chronic kidney disease. The subdivision of stage 3 into 3A and 3B is not part of the original Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative classifi cation but has been advocated by other organizations (e. g. NICE in the UK). It refl ects the higher incidence of cardiovascular disease and complications (e. g. anaemia) that are more prevalent, as estimated glomerular filtration rate falls below 45mL/min. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate 60mL/min should not be considered to have chronic kidney disease, unless there is concomitant evidence of Kidney damage: Urinary abnormalities (proteinuria, haematuria). Structural abnormalities (e. g. abnormal renal imaging). Genetic disease (e. g. APKD). Histologically established disease. The reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate and/or urinary abnormalities should ideally be present on at least two occasions ≥ 3 months apart. It has been suggested that the suffi x (p) is added to the chronic kidney disease stage to indicate the presence of proteinuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30mg/mmol or urine protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 45mg/mmol). This helps to highlight the i risk of both progression and CV disease (e. g. stage 3p). Chronic renal failure (chronic renal failure) is now an outmoded term that indicates an irreversible decline in glomerular filtration rate. WHAT IS CHRONIC Kidney DISEASE (chronic kidney disease)? 193 3 The majority of patients with chronic kidney disease stages 1 3 do not progress to Kidney failure. The risk of death from CV disease is far higher than the risk of progression (b p. 198). Causes of chronic kidney disease Accurate data on the causes of early chronic kidney disease are scarce. Registry data focuses on causes of end-stage renal disease (end-stage renal disease). As only a relatively small number progress (and live long enough) to reach Dialysis or transplantation, it is diffi cult to extrapolate back to early chronic kidney disease. Recent UK and ultrasound causes are shown in Table 3. 2, but there is considerable variation worldwide.

Over 19 million of the ultrasound adult population are thought to have some form of chronic kidney disease. The most common associations are i blood pressure, Diabetes, and vascular disease. In the UK study just mentioned, the ageand gender-adjusted odds ratios were 2. 1 for i blood pressure, 1. 33 for Diabetes, and 1. 69 for CV disease. chronic kidney disease prevalence rises dramatically with age from 78 pmp age 40 to 5, 900 pmp age 80.

These colossal estimates of prevalence have led to chronic kidney disease being proposed as an important public health issue. chronic kidney disease is more common in many ethnic minorities, e. g. in association with Diabetes in South Asian and hypertension in black people. Additional genetic factors are also likely to play a role in the relative over-representation of certain ethnic groups in end-stage renal disease programmes.

American Journal of Kidney Diseases, 4 1, 1 12. PREVALENCE OF chronic kidney disease 195 Criticisms of the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative classifi cation Although the 2002 classifi cation is now ubiquitous, it is not without its problems. Criticisms include the following: The classifi cation sets out to identify risk yet labels as a disease. It defi nes disease on a laboratory variable alone, with no clinical assessment or correlation. Many patients will be caused unnecessary anxiety. Many live Kidney donors have an estimated glomerular filtration rate 60mL/min post-nephrectomy. Do they have a disease? The MDRD estimated glomerular filtration rate equation was validated in subjects with renal disease and yet is being used to evaluate subjects without it. The equation is not suffi ciently validated for differences in age, race, and body habitus. MDRD tends to underestimate true glomerular filtration rate (yet the values are generally unconditionally accepted). The vast estimates of chronic kidney disease prevalence offered by the classifi cation are unrealistic and should be viewed as distribution values for estimated glomerular filtration rate in a particular population, rather than true disease prevalence. The classifi cation does not take account of the age-related change in glomerular filtration rate. Many view this as natural senescence, not pathology (7 25% age 70 have an estimated glomerular filtration rate 60mL/min and 6 Kidney disease ). The estimated glomerular filtration rate bands used to defi ne stages are arbitrary: Stage 3: a 25-year-old proteinuric 4 whose renal function has rapidly deteriorated to an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30 35mL/min. Stage 3: a 75-year-old 5 with no other evidence of Kidney disease and a stable estimated glomerular filtration rate of 55 59mL/min. Identical stage notwithstanding, the implications for these individuals are very, very different. Is it a useful CV risk assessment tool? Although there is an association between d estimated glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, and CV risk, a causal link is unproven. Also, this relationship mainly operates at estimated glomerular filtration rate 45mL/min. The classifi cation implies progression from one stage to the next. In reality, this does not occur. Stage 3 seldom progresses to 4 or 5. It defi nes normal function as 90mL/min and disease as 60mL/min. Neither is particular satisfactory nor evidence-based.",

It does not give enough weight to microalbuminuria or overt proteinuria, which may be better markers of CV risk (especially in early stages). Many laboratories do not report a value for estimated glomerular filtration rate when 60mL/min, removing any justifi cation for separating stages 1 and 2. Large numbers have been diagnosed with early chronic kidney disease this has diverted specialist time away from Kidney failure and its treatment. The term chronic kidney disease should be reserved for persistent, irreversible renal pathology, not just reductions in estimated glomerular filtration rate unless there are pathophysiological consequences, such as anaemia or altered salt and Water homeostasis (often not present until estimated glomerular filtration rate 30mL/min). It has been suggested that percentile charts of estimated glomerular filtration rate in healthy individuals of both sexes, across all ages, and in different populations should be used to defi ne an abnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate. 196 CHAPTER 3 Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) Diagnosis of chronic kidney disease 2 Always assume a d estimated glomerular filtration rate represents acute Kidney injury until proven otherwise. Is there a historical estimated glomerular filtration rate for comparison? Has there been a recent illness or change in medication? If uncertain, repeat within 5 days, and seek specialist help, as necessary. Why is it important to identify patients with chronic kidney disease? chronic kidney disease is associated with i CV risk. Modifying CV risk factors (2 i blood pressure) would be expected to d morbidity and mortality. Some patients will benefi t from further investigation (e. g. renal biopsy) to identify a potentially treatable intrinsic renal disease (e. g. glomerulonephritis) or renal involvement in a systemic illness (e. g. myeloma). Whatever the underlying cause, it may be possible to slow or prevent progression to Kidney failure. Complications (e. g. anaemia) can be identifi ed and treated early. Those (relatively few) patients who will go on to Kidney failure and potentially need Dialysis or transplantation can be adequately prepared. Patients with chronic kidney disease are at higher risk of acute Kidney injury. This is often preventable (e. g. after IV contrast administration). estimated glomerular filtration rate for diagnosis and management of chronic kidney disease Serum Creatinine (serum creatinine) has a non-linear relationship with glomerular filtration rate. In early chronic kidney disease, serum creatinine may remain within the normal range and be misleading. estimated glomerular filtration rate is calculated from formulae that adjust serum creatinine for age, sex, and race. The most widely used (and foundation of the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative classifi cation) is the Modifi cation of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation since it appeared the most reliable and reproducible in individual patients. More recently, the chronic kidney disease Epidemiology Collaboration pooled study data to produce the chronic kidney disease-EPI equation. This provides a more accurate assessment of glomerular filtration rate in individuals with normal or only slightly d glomerular filtration rate. This results in lower estimates of chronic kidney disease prevalence and more accurate prediction of adverse outcomes. Most laboratories will routinely report an MDRD estimated glomerular filtration rate, although the use of chronic kidney disease-EPI is likely to increase. Formulae are available at: M or M professionals/tools. Several useful free Apps are also available, e. g. MedCalc, QxMD, MedMath, Epocrates (fee-requiring). Normal glomerular filtration rate is 7 100mL/min/1. 73m2, so estimated glomerular filtration rate gives a (very) rough percentage of Kidney function.",

Cautions It is only an estimate (confi dence intervals are wide; 90% of patients will have a glomerular filtration rate within 30% of their estimated glomerular filtration rate). estimated glomerular filtration rate is likely to be inaccurate at extremes of body habitus (malnourished, obese) as well as in amputees and during pregnancy. It is not fully validated in age 18. Race: only validated in Caucasians and black people though probably acceptable utility in South Asians ( (cid: 2) check whether your lab corrects for race, otherwise use a correction factor of x 1. 21 for black patients). It is not validated if the glomerular filtration rate is rapidly changing (e. g. acute kidney injury). DIAGNOSIS OF chronic kidney disease 197 The MDRD equation tends to underestimate normal renal function. chronic kidney disease-EPI is more reliable in this situation. It is less accurate in individuals with very poor Kidney function. Screening for chronic kidney disease?

Take 100 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate 60mL/min. 7 1% will progress to Kidney failure each year. However, there is a 10% death rate (mainly CV disease), so, after 10 years, 8 patients will require RRT, 27 will have smouldering chronic kidney disease, and 65 will be dead! 2 An estimated 8 million people in the USA have an estimated glomerular filtration rate 60mL/min. Those that survive to start RRT do so with a High CV disease burden. Dialysis patients are 7 20x more likely to die a CV death than the general population. A cardiac cause is implicated in 40% of all deaths at end-stage renal disease. end-stage renal disease 5-year survival (UK data): age 18 34 is 90%; age 45 54 is 70%; age 65 74 is 30%; age 75 is 20%.

Lifestyle advice: Encourage exercise. Offer smoking cessation help and advice. Healthy diet; adequate nutrition. Meticulous blood pressure control (130/80): use angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker to d proteinuria. Management of lipids, usually with a statin: Evidence of benefi t for lipid-lowering therapy in chronic kidney disease is limited. For example, the Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse (4D) study showed no benefi t from cholesterol reduction by atorvastatin in Dialysis patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Explanation: competing CV risk may drown out the benefi t of statins in this very High-risk group. Similarly, AURORA, a RCT of 2, 776 hemodialysis patients comparing rosuvastatin vs placebo, showed no benefi t of LDL reduction against a composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarctionand non-fatal stroke. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN chronic kidney disease 199 However, SHARP, an RCT of 9, 438 chronic kidney disease (Dialysis or chronic kidney disease) with no history of myocardial infarction or CV revascularization, compared simvastatin ezetimibe against placebo, fi nding a 17% reduction in major vascular events after mean 4. 7 years follow-up. Recent guidelines, including those for non-chronic kidney disease populations (e. g. those produced by the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology), have moved away from traditional numeric targets for primary and secondary prevention towards the estimation of risk as the basis for treatment (usually a statin).

Decline in glomerular filtration rate tends to be linear over time, unless clinical circumstances change. Progression of chronic kidney disease is more often due to s maladaptive haemodynamic and metabolic factors than underlying disease activity (see Fig. 3. 2). A series of interacting processes eventually results in: Glomerulosclerosis (glomerular scarring and obsolescence). Proteinuria. Tubulointerstitial fi brosis. Mechanisms Raised intra-glomerular Hypertension As nephrons scar and drop out , remaining nephrons undergo compensatory adaptation, with i Blood fl ow per nephron and hyperfi ltration attempting to normalize glomerular filtration rate (the Brenner hypothesis). Changes in glomerular capillary wall permeability are a feature of glomerular diseases. Renal vasodilatation may be an initiating event, with the glomerulus exposed to a higher capillary Hypertension. Glomerular damage i intra-glomerular Hypertension l i wall stress and endothelial injury. i strain on mesangial cells l i matrix deposition mediated (in part) by angiotensin II and cytokine release (TGFB, PDGF). Proteinuria may be due to an underlying glomerular lesion or result from raised intra-glomerular Hypertension. Protein or factors bound to fi ltered albumin (such as fatty acids, growth factors, or metabolic end-products) may lead to: Direct proximal tubular cell injury. Local cytokine synthesis ( l recruitment of interstitial infl ammatory cells). Pro-fi brotic factors l interstitial scarring. Myofi broblast activation and tubular epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) occur, further fuelling the fi brogenic process. Tubulointerstitial scarring The degree of tubulointerstitial damage correlates better with long-term prognosis than glomerular damage. Proteinuria may itself be harmful to the tubulointerstitium, but chronic ischaemic damage is also important: tissue O tension is relatively 2 Low in the renal medulla, making tubules sensitive to hypoxic injury. Chronic ischaemia 6 occurs with: Damage to glomerular capillaries (glomerulosclerosis l altered peritubular perfusion). renal artery stenosis activation l intrarenal vasoconstriction. Intratubular capillary loss and i diffusion distance between capillaries and tubular cells ( l a vicious cycle of hypoxic damage).

Investigation: urinalysis (haematuria and/or proteinuria may suggest a renal or systemic disease that could benefi t from specifi c intervention), USS renal tract, renal biopsy. Infl uence mediators of progression There is considerable overlap in the measures employed to prevent progression and those used to modify CV risk (b p. 202). In addition, these often dovetail with a patient s existing treatments for CV disease, Diabetes, or hypertension. This enables an integrated management programme to be developed that is easy for the patient (and physician) to understand and administer. PROGRESSION OF chronic kidney disease: GENERAL 203 Preventing progression: Blood Hypertension i blood pressure is almost universal in chronic kidney disease and may be both cause or effect. i blood pressure l glomerular fi ltration Hypertension and i proteinuria l i renal injury. blood pressure control unequivocally slows progression of chronic kidney disease and is the main renoprotective strategy. A large body of evidence supports the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and ARBs as fi rst-line antihypertensives in both diabetic and non-diabetic chronic kidney disease, particularly if concomitant proteinuria. These agents: d efferent arteriolar tone l d intra-glomerular Hypertension and d proteinuria. d A2 activity l A2-induced infl ammation l d fi brosis and scarring. ACE-Is affect both angiotensin type 1 (A1) and type 2 (A2) receptors but may not completely inhibit A2 formation. ARBs block A1, but not A2, receptors. blood pressure targets are more stringent in chronic kidney disease (and lower still for patients with proteinuria). (See b p. 204. ) The stringent application of current evidence would result in: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for renoprotection in: (i) type 1 diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria or overt diabetic nephropathy; (ii) type 2 diabetes mellitus with i blood pressure or microalbuminuria; (iii) non-diabetic chronic kidney disease with proteinuria 0. 5g/day. ARBs for renoprotection in type 2 diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria or overt nephropathy. Few studies have directly compared angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker treatment in chronic kidney disease. Combination angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker therapy ( dual blockade ) reduces blood pressure and proteinuria to a greater extent than monotherapy but has not been shown to d chronic kidney disease progression (see also b p. 614). There is often reluctance to use angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in more advanced chronic kidney disease because of fears of i potassium or a rapid fall in glomerular filtration rate. However, evidence suggests that the benefi t of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy is present, regardless of the initial level of renal function. X There is evidence that dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e. g. nifedipine and amlodipine) may adversely effect the progression of chronic kidney disease through effects on the renal microcirculation.",

In the Kidney, it infl uences mesangial cell and podocyte proliferation, downregulates renal artery stenosis (via renin inhibition), prevents glomerular hypertrophy, decreases cytokine production, reduces infl ammation, and blocks epithelial to mesenchymal transition. There is experimental (and limited clinical) evidence that it may ameliorate proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fi brosis. Optimum replacement strategies, however, remain unclear (see b p. 250). Dietary Protein restriction d Protein intake in animal models protects against glomerulosclerosis. Appears to d intra-glomerular Hypertension and d glomerular hypertrophy. Non-haemodynamic effects, such as d TGFB and d matrix accumulation, may also be important. In humans, the benefi t of Protein restriction is controversial. Although progression may be slowed, a huge investment is required by both patients and dietetic staff. Long-term compliance is often poor. At present, optimal dietary Protein intake in chronic kidney disease is uncertain. X A reasonable regimen is an intake of 7 0. 8 1. 0g/kg of Protein/day. Lower levels may risk malnutrition (particularly in advanced chronic kidney disease or with nephrotic range proteinuria). Diabetic nephropathy may be more responsive.

However, the ALTITUDE study, designed to determine if a renin inhibitor could reduce CV and renal morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus when added to conventional treatment (including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker), was stopped early after more frequent adverse events were reported in the treatment arm.

This leads to chronic infl ammation and oxidative stress, with accumulation of metabolic end-products, accelerated atherogenesis, disruption of the immune system, and anaemia. The retained compounds or toxins have multiple effects: Many remain unidentifi ed. They are divided into Low and middle molecular weight molecules by size (500Da Low; 500Da middle). Ur and serum creatinine are routinely measured but are not directly toxic. They act as markers for other LMW substances, including guanidines, such as asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) a potent inhibitor of NO synthase. Retained middle molecules include: B 2 microglobulin (12, 000Da) a component of MHC (the cause of Dialysis-related amyloid).

Prior to this, recurrent transfusion was the norm ( l iron overload, risk of Blood-borne viruses, and sensitization to foreign antigens with implications for transplantation). Newer therapeutic agents still aim to stimulate red cell production via the erythropoietin receptor but may not be based on recombinant erythropoietin. The term erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (erythropoiesis-stimulating agent) has been introduced to refl ect this. Increasing numbers of early chronic kidney disease patients and virtually all Dialysis patients receive an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent. Black and diabetic patients tend to have higher rates of anaemia for each chronic kidney disease stage. The target range for hemoglobin is lower than the normal physiological range, e. g. 10 12g/dL (UK Renal Association). X Randomized trials have found i CV complication rate with higher hemoglobin targets so optimal treatment strategies remain uncertain ( b p. 226). Patients receiving ESAs invariably need concomitant iron therapy and iron alone may be suffi cient to correct anaemia in some ( b p. 230). chronic kidney disease patients require different targets for iron parameters from non-chronic kidney disease individuals to facilitate optimal red cell production (b p. 230). The success of ESAs in chronic kidney disease has led to their use to treat anaemia in other contexts, particularly chemotherapy-associated anaemia (X ESAs have been associated with i thromboembolic events and d survival in cancer patients and could theoretically stimulate tumour growth). The cost of anaemia management is substantial.

Hepatic erythropoietin production is also important in fetal, but not adult, life. The Kidney is ideally placed to regulate red blood cell production, as it is uniquely able to sense and control both O tension and circulating 2 volume (and to differentiate between the two): Control of red cell mass is mediated by erythropoietin. Circulating volume is regulated by renal salt and Water excretion. chronic kidney disease and renal scarring l d functioning renal tissue l d erythropoietin synthesis l d red blood cell production l anaemia. Exceptions (where erythropoietin may be overproduced) are: APKD, benign renal cysts, renal cell carcinoma, and chronic hypoxia. erythropoietin production (See Fig. 3. 3) If glomerular filtration rate is normal, plasma erythropoietin levels are inversely proportional to hemoglobin concentration. This relationship breaks down in chronic kidney disease (where erythropoietin levels are usually inappropriately in the normal range). Anaemia or d environmental O l d Blood O content l 2 2 O -dependent gene expression li erythropoietin secretion. 2 Central to this are the hypoxia inducible transcription factors HIF-1 and HIF-2. HIF-1 and 2 have an O -regulated A subunit and constitutively expressed B subunit. 2 In states of normal O tension, intracellular HIF-1 and 2 are continuously inactivated by (iron-de 2 pendent) proline hydroxylation of their A subunit. Once hydroxylated, they are targeted by the von Hippel Lindau Protein (pVHL) for ubiquitinization and proteasomal degradation. In hypoxic conditions, A subunit hydroxylation and degradation do not occur, and HIF A remains free to enter the nucleus and form a heterodimer with HIFB. The HIF A HIF B heterodimer binds the hypoxia response element (HRE) and initiates erythropoietin transcription. Several mechanisms exist to regulate erythropoietin production, including the GATA family of transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4) and haematopoietic cell phosphatase (HCP-1). All are potential therapeutic targets ( b p. 221). During hypoxia, HIF activity is induced in multiple cell types where it activates a panoply of target genes (100), including those involved in angiogenesis and glycolysis. Genetic mutations in the HIF pathway are responsible for certain congenital polycythaemias. Activation of the erythropoietin receptor (erythropoietin-R) prevents erythroid cell apoptosis through downstream JAK2/STAT5 signalling pathways. erythropoietin AND THE Kidney 219 Normoxia Hypoxia HIF HIF Alpha subunit Beta subunit Alpha subunit Beta subunit Fe erythropoietin Proline Degradation of hydroxylation alpha subunit O2 Red cell production VHL Protein Ubiquitin ligase in bone marrow Fig. 3. 3 Regulation of erythropoietin production. erythropoietin beyond anaemia: cytoprotection In addition to the role of erythropoietin in the regulation of erythropoiesis, there is increasing interest in its potential anti-apoptotic and cytoprotective effect. The erythropoietin-R is widely distributed (e. g. neurons, cardiac myocytes, endothelial cells, hepatocytes, and mesangial cells), and expression is increased in response to hypoxic injury. It is hoped this might be therapeutically exploited and that exogenous erythropoiesis-stimulating agent administration might offer protection from injury in various clinical scenarios. This concept has been successfully explored in numerous animal models of tissue injury, particularly ischaemia reperfusion (including nervous system, cardiac, and renal).",

However, a recent randomized, placebo-controlled trial of an IV erythropoiesis-stimulating agent in early acute ischaemic stroke reported more deaths in the group receiving the erythropoiesis-stimulating agent. Short-acting ESAs with retained cytoprotective, but reduced erythropoietic, effects are under development. 220 CHAPTER 3 Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) At present, no evidence distinguishes ESAs in terms of clinical effi cacy.

Short-acting Epoetin α and β. erythropoietinA (Eprex , Epogen , or Procrit ) and erythropoietinB (NeoRecormon ) have been in use for 7 20 years and are clinically indistinguishable. Both are synthesized in transformed Chinese hamster ovary cells and have identical amino acid sequences (if different glycosylation patterns). Other recombinant epoetins have emerged, sharing the 165-amino acid structure, e. g. epoetins omega and delta. Biosimilar agents. The term biosimilar is used to describe a generic product that is deliberately similar to molecules already in clinical use. Manufacturers submit data suggesting their agent is chemically and pharmacokinetically identical to a reference drug (usually erythropoietinA or -B ). Clinical data generated with the original is then extrapolated to the new product. The reduced RD and marketing costs ensure products are commercially competitive, e. g. epoetin-zeta (Retacrit ). Long-acting Darbepoetin α (Aranesp ). Recombinant erythropoietin with a twist: fi ve amino acids are substituted away from the erythropoietin-R binding site to allow the insertion of two carbohydrate side chains.

Methoxy polyethylene glycol epoetin B (Mircera ) incorporates a large polymer chain to increase its MW to 760kDa (erythropoietin: 30. 4kDa). Half-life is increased (considerably) to 130h, and it can rapidly dissociate from the erythropoietin-R after binding.

It has been successfully used to treat patients with PRCA ( b p. 225). Manufactured by a relatively simple process, less immunogenic, and stable at room temperature. Administered IV/SC x 1/month. Currently awaiting FDA approval. Non-peptide ESAs: Offer potential for oral administration. Prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF stabilizers). Prevent the hydroxylation and inactivation of HIF A ( b p. 218). Problem: many other genes are regulated by prolyl hydroxylation. HIF stabilizer FG-4592 currently in clinical trials. GATA inhibition: GATA are a family of transcription factors. GATA-2 is a negative regulator of erythropoietin gene expression, so its inhibition is of interest. Haemopoietic cell phosphatase (HCP) inhibitors: HCP is a tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates JAK-2 and functions as a negative regulator of intracellular erythropoietin signalling. Gene therapy: Various delivery systems, such as adenovirus transfection, are under investigation. erythropoietin could be released into the circulation at any site and by any cell type. Regulation of expression is likely to be the greatest obstacle to this approach. 222 CHAPTER 3 Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) Prescribing ESAs When to start? Consider an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent when hemoglobin 11g/dL (local protocols may vary). X There is uncertainty as to the optimum time to commence erythropoiesis-stimulating agent therapy. Does a numerical hemoglobin threshold decide the best time, or would an earlier start prevent CV complications? ESAs have previously been thought of as safe and effective but recent evidence suggests you c an have too much of a Good thing ( b p. 226). UK Renal Association guidelines 6 recommend that treatment should be reserved for patients who are likely to benefi t from improved quality of life or physical function and to avoid transfusions. They remain relatively underprescribed in chronic kidney disease (only 1/3 of patients starting Dialysis are receiving an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent). Economic considerations will inevitably apply. Preparation for erythropoiesis-stimulating agent therapy 2 Have other causes of anaemia been considered (b p. 217), especially iron defi ciency? Is the patient likely to respond? Cytokine release associated with infection (or chronic infl ammation) impairs erythropoiesis-stimulating agent response. Identify and treat these fi rst. i CRP usually predicts poor response. Is blood pressure controlled? ESAs tend to i blood pressure. Severe i blood pressure was not uncommon in the early days of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent use (mechanism: vasoconstriction and enhanced adrenergic responsiveness) but has d in incidence with the refi nement of treatment algorithms (which generally aim for a slower rise in hemoglobin). Investigations FBC with red cell indices. Determine iron status: Serum ferritin; recommended range 200 500 micrograms/L. Serum iron and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). Transferrin saturation (transferrin saturation); recommended range 20 40%. % hypochromic RBCs (% HRBC); recommended target 6%. CRP. Serum B12 and folate. Consider faecal occult Blood testing. 2 Measurement of erythropoietin levels is expensive, misleading, and unnecessary. Choice of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent There is no evidence to distinguish between ESAs on the basis of clinical effi cacy. Choice will depend on local protocols, availability, and patient/ physician preference. Route of administration Either SC or IV (IV often used in haemodialysis patients given at the end of a Dialysis treatment to reduce dialyser absorption). This can also assist compliance. PRESCRIBING ESAs 223 Pre-Dialysis chronic kidney disease and peritoneal Dialysis patients can be taught to self-administer an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent at home, using a range of user-friendly devices. There is a dose adjustment between SC and IV administration for some ESAs ( b p. 220), but there is much interpatient variability.",

There is no consensus on the best approach, but consider temporary i dose. erythropoiesis-stimulating agent resistance or hyporesponsiveness True erythropoiesis-stimulating agent resistance is variously defi ned as: Failure to reach target hemoglobin, or The need to administer above a threshold erythropoiesis-stimulating agent dose (e. g. ≥ 300IU/kg/wk of epoetin A or B ) or 1. 5 micrograms/kg/wk of darbepoetin A to maintain target hemoglobin. Relative resistance is common. Run through, and proactively exclude, the alternative causes of chronic kidney disease-associated anaemia (see b p. 217). 2 Always exclude iron defi ciency. If iron stores prove refractory to iron administration, check for faecal occult Blood, and consider further GI investigation. Assess compliance. Check reticulocyte count in non-responders.

    "text": "Bone marrow examination reveals absent erythroid precursors. Anti-erythropoietin antibodies can be measured. There has always been a Low background incidence of PRCA due to viral infections (parvovirus), lymphoma, and certain drugs. Acquired PRCA was fi rst reported in the late 1990s, with 7 250 patients worldwide developing anti-erythropoietin antibodies. These antibodies cross-react with endogenous erythropoietin, rendering patients profoundly anaemic and transfusion-dependent. Almost all these cases occurred in Dialysis patients on SC (but not IV) epoetin A (a handful of cases have been described with other ESAs). Extensive (and expensive) investigation suggested that polysorbate (in the drug vehicle) was able to react with compounds leaching from uncoated rubber stoppers in prefi lled syringes. This had an adjuvant effect, promoting the molecules immunogenicity (which is already higher by the SC route). Switching to a different erythropoiesis-stimulating agent proved unhelpful because the antibody cross-reacted. Immunosuppression was tried, with variable success. Peginesatide (formerly hematide) ( b p. 221) differs in structure and does not cross-react with the antibody. It has been successfully used as treatment. PRCA led many countries to abandon epoetin A by the SC route. However, following a change to the manufacturing process, its use remains widespread. 226 CHAPTER 3 Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) ESAs: target haemoglobin X Although ESAs can be benefi cial for patients with chronic kidney disease-related anaemia, they are not without intrinsic risks. Despite observational data suggesting an association between lower hemoglobin and poorer outcomes, recent randomized trials have demonstrated overall worse outcomes and higher risk of death with erythropoiesis-stimulating agent treatment, particularly with higher hemoglobin targets. Infl uential clinical trials CHOIR Correction of Hemoglobin and Outcomes in Renal Insuffi ciency study. USA; published 2007. Hypothesis: using epoetin A to achieve an hemoglobin of 13. 5g/dL, compared to hemoglobin 11. 3g/dL, would d CV complications and death. Randomized, open label design; 1, 432 patients, chronic kidney disease 3 4 (non-Dialysis); initial hemoglobin targets 10. 5 11. 0g/dL and 13. 0 1 3. 5g/dL, but a protocol amendment changed the targets to absolute values (hemoglobin 11. 3g/dL vs 13. 5g/dL). p outcome: time to all-cause mortality or myocardial infarction, CVA, Heart failure (heart failure). Stopped early; mean 16 months follow-up. Finding: 34% increase in the risk of primary composite outcome in higher target group (mainly heart failure). Little difference in quality of life. Problems: High dropout rate, differences in two groups at baseline, higher target not actually achieved despite huge erythropoiesis-stimulating agent doses. CREATE Cardiovascular Risk Reduction by Early Anaemia Treatment with Epoetin study. European; published 2007. Hypothesis: early vs late anaemia correction with epoetin A will d mortality and CV morbidity in chronic kidney disease 3 4. Randomized, open label design; 603 patients, chronic kidney disease 3 4 (non-Dialysis); hemoglobin targets 10. 5 11. 5g/dL and 13. 0 15. 0g/dL. p outcome: time to CV event. 24 months follow-up. Finding: trend to higher event rate in higher target group (not statistically signifi cant). Quality of life better in higher target group. Problems: Low CV event rate (6%). Although both studies had faults, the trends toward poorer outcomes led the ultrasound Food and Drug Administration to signifi cantly escalate the label warnings for erythropoiesis-stimulating agent drugs, strongly cautioning against higher targets.

Interaction with patient s comorbidity (particularly if poor erythropoiesis-stimulating agent response and higher doses, e. g. infl ammation, CV disease). The future Further large, well-designed clinical studies are needed to clarify the safety and effi cacy of ESAs. Ideally, target hemoglobin would be individualized, with a risk-benefi t assessment based on a patient s specifi c level of function, lifestyle, and comorbidity. Current targets (see Table 3. 8) (cid: 2) For now, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent treatment to hemoglobin targets above 11 12g/dL, particularly in those with signifi cant CV morbidity, should be avoided. Some would go further and suggest that, given current evidence, the use of ESAs should no longer be habitual in pre-Dialysis patients, especially in relatively asymptomatic patients with mild to moderate anaemia (hemoglobin 7 9 11g/dL), and that large erythropoiesis-stimulating agent doses should certainly be avoided in this situation.

Iron defi ciency is found in 7 40% of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and virtually all Dialysis patients. For optimal red blood cell production, chronic kidney disease patients require different targets for iron markers than non-chronic kidney disease individuals (b p. 230). erythropoiesis-stimulating agent treatment leads to almost universal iron defi ciency. Iron absorption from the gut is lower in chronic kidney disease patients. Consequently, oral iron is usually ineffective ( b p. 229). Many chronic kidney disease patients and virtually all Dialysis patients require parenteral iron therapy. Iron therapy alone may treat anaemia in pre-Dialysis chronic kidney disease patients. Causes of iron defi ciency in chronic kidney disease Absolute iron defi ciency Occurs when body iron stores are genuinely Low. Characterized by a Low serum ferritin. Reduced intake: Poor appetite.

Functional iron defi ciency Despite adequate storage iron, it is not made available at a rate that satisfi es demand. This is common when the erythropoiesis-stimulating agent-driven supraphysiological rate of erythropoiesis has outpaced the delivery of iron by transferrin. Characterized by a normal or raised ferritin and Low transferrin saturation (20%).

Markers of iron status Several markers of iron status are available. Unfortunately, they lack sensitivity and specifi city to predict the response to iron therapy in the context of chronic kidney disease. It is generally recommended that ferritin and at least one additional test are used. Ferritin: Cellular storage Protein and marker of storage iron.

Percentage hypochromic red Blood cells (% HRBC): Measure of the iron incorporated into RBCs. Reticulocyte hemoglobin count (CHr): Measure of the iron incorporated into immature RBCs. Others: serum transferrin receptor and erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin levels are mainly research tools at present. Hepcidin This recently described, hepatically synthesized peptide has emerged as a key regulator of iron homeostasis. Inhibits both GI iron absorption and iron release from the Liver and reticuloendothelial system. Hepcidin exerts its actions through binding to ferroportin, a cellular iron effl ux channel. Binding l internalization and degradation. Animal models: Hepcidin knockout l severe iron overload. Hepcidin overexpression l severe iron defi ciency anaemia. Human haemochromatosis results from either defi ciency or failed regulation of hepcidin. Plays a key role in the anaemia of chronic kidney disease, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent resistance, and the anaemia of chronic disease. Synthesis is induced by iron loading and infl ammation, and suppressed by erythropoiesis, iron defi ciency, and hypoxia. Iron loading/infl ammation l i hepcidin ld GI iron absorption d hepatic and reticuloendothelial iron release l d plasma iron levels. Erythropoiesis/iron defi ciency/hypoxia l d hepcidin l i GI iron absorption i hepatic and reticuloendothelial iron release l i plasma iron levels. Hepcidin is eliminated by the Kidney, so chronic kidney disease indirectly causes reduced GI iron absorption and iron store availability. Hepcidin levels rise as chronic kidney disease progresses (highest in Dialysis patients). Levels also increase in infection and infl ammation. Hepcidin could prove to be a useful marker of iron status: Functional iron defi ciency l Low hepcidin. Reticuloendothelial blockade l High hepcidin. Levels i with iron loading so may help avoid iron overload. Low hepcidin levels may identify those patients likely to respond to oral iron. The future: hepcidin antagonists could stimulate iron absorption and mobilization, blocking the inhibitory effect of chronic kidney disease or infl ammation on red cell production ( ld parenteral iron administration and d erythropoiesis-stimulating agent requirement). 230 CHAPTER 3 Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) Iron: therapy and targets 2 Prescribing an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent to an iron-defi cient patient is a waste of time and money.

Defer administration if active infection, as potential risk of compromised neutrophil function. Current preparations contain elemental iron enclosed in a carbohydrate shell.

In haemodialysis patients, it is practical to give regular Low doses of iron, e. g. 100mg weekly. This is obviously less convenient in pre-Dialysis or peritoneal Dialysis patients. 2 Adverse reactions Free iron reaction: d blood pressure, nausea, Vomiting, dizziness, sweating, myalgia, back Pain, arthralgia, pruritus. Often less problematic with slower administration. Usually self-limiting, but consider treatment with hydrocortisone and/or antihistamines. 3 Anaphylaxis: risk Low, but staff should be appropriately trained and adequate resuscitation facilities immediately available. Preparations of intravenous iron Iron III hydroxide sucrose complex (iron sucrose/saccharate) Venofer . Low incidence of adverse reactions. Anaphylaxis very rare (0. 05%). Test dose unnecessary. Widely used, particularly in Europe. IV infusion or slow IV injection (20mg/min), often diluted in 100mL saline. Typical dosing pre-Dialysis or peritoneal Dialysis: 200mg every 1 3 months (200mg weekly for three doses, if clinical urgency). Haemodialysis: initially 100mg for ten Dialysis sessions. Continue weekly if ferritin 500 micrograms/L. Sodium ferric gluconate Ferrlecit . Anaphylaxis rare. Test dose unnecessary. Widely used. More iron may be released directly to storage and not to transferrin. Usually administered as 62. 5 125mg IV over 10min on haemodialysis.

Total dose of iron infusions of Low MW iron (III) hydroxide dextran complex (Cosmofer ) (e. g. 20mg/kg over 4 6h) have been used for more rapid iron repletion and to avoid multiple infusions.

    "text": "9) chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder (chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder) is a relatively new term that describes the mineral, skeletal, and related CV consequences of chronic kidney disease (particularly CV calcifi cation). This expanded focus has been driven by observational studies suggesting that chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (and its treatment) may impact on CV morbidity and mortality. Vascular disease is common and progresses rapidly in chronic kidney disease, particularly at stage 5 usually occlusive lesions due to atheromatous plaques. The full spectrum of arterial disease in chronic kidney disease is broader, however, including vessel wall calcifi cation with resulting impaired vascular function. Renal bone disease (osteodystrophy) is reserved to describe the bone pathologies associated with chronic kidney disease. Osteodystrophy is a heterogeneous disorder that ultimately leads to diminished bone strength. chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder is invariably present beyond chronic kidney disease 3, and its management represents a signifi cant clinical challenge. There is no single therapeutic intervention that fi ts all instead, a package of management, customized to the individual patient, is necessary. Several important international practice guidelines have been formulated to help inform the optimal treatment of chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder ( b p. 244). Table 3. 9 KDIGOa classifi cation of chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder and renal osteodystrophy Defi nition of chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder A systemic disorder of mineral and bone metabolism due to chronic kidney disease, manifested by either one or a combination of the following: Abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, or vitamin D metabolism. Abnormalities of bone turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth, or strength. Vascular or other soft tissue calcifi cation. Defi nition of renal osteodystrophy Renal osteodystrophy is an alteration of bone morphology in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Relationship with osteodystrophy Most commonly associated with ABD where the skeleton fails to buffer calcium 2 and PO, leaving them available for use in calcifi cation. In 4 secondary hyperparathyroidism, the release of calcium 2 and PO during bone resorption may also 4 favour calcifi cation. X Both calcium-containing phosphate binders and active vitamin D can create a ve calcium balance, with a risk of ABD and i CaxP. There is evidence linking calcium intake to arterial calcifi cation. This has provoked an extremely robust, ongoing debate within chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder: VASCULAR CALCIFICATION 243 nephrology about the future role of these treatments (both previously cornerstones of therapy) (see b pp. 246251). Prevention and treatment Follow best practice guidelines for chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder, as outlined on b p. 244. Some evidence that sevelamer HCl, a non-calcium-containing binder, may slow progression of coronary and aortic calcifi cation. Calcimimetics may help control parathyroid hormone without i CaxP or large doses of vitamin D. A potential future role is currently under study (b p. 252). Daily or long-hours Dialysis with superior PO control (negating the 4 need for binders) may help, as might transplantation. Biology of vascular calcifi cation in chronic kidney disease A new paradigm that departs from the traditional view of i CaxP passively promoting calcifi cation has recently emerged, revealing an extremely complex and closely regulated process. The evidence trail is as follows: Although calcifi cation appears to correlate, in part, with calcium intake, it was frequently encountered prior to the widespread use of calcium-based phosphate binders. A poorly understood association between arterial calcifi cation and bone disease has long been recognized in the context of osteoporosis where mineral metabolism is less overtly disturbed. The calcium deposited in vessels is in the form of hydroxyapatite crystals the same as in the skeleton. Spontaneous vascular calcifi cation occurs in rodents carrying specifi c gene deletions (e. g. apolipoprotein-E, fetuin-A, and OPG). Certain hitherto bone-specifi c regulatory transcription factors (particularly Cbfa1) and proteins (e. g. osteocalcin, osteonectin, and alkaline phosphatase) have been demonstrated in calcifi ed vessels. Several stimuli (including i PO and uraemic serum) are able to 4 promote the differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells to an osteoblastic phenotype (via the upregulation of the sodium-dependent cotransporter Pit-1). Such cells then form matrix vesicles and initiate the process of matrix deposition and mineralization. Regulation of calcifi cation is achieved through a balance of promoters (e. g. BMP-2, RANKL) and inhibitors (e. g. matrix GIa Protein, itself inhibited by warfarin, osteopontin, fetuin-A, PTHrP, OPG). In addition, i parathyroid hormone, i blood pressure, abnormal glucose metabolism, dyslipidaemia (particularly d HDL), infl ammation ( i CRP, i IL-6, i TNFA, d fetuin-A), oxidative stress, and natural inhibitor defi ciencies are all likely to play a role. Further complexity is suggested by the discovery of cross-talk between osteoblasts and adipocytes (via leptin and other hormones) and 6 bone remodelling and energy metabolism. This may have particular relevance in Diabetes where Low bone turnover is common.",

Keep serum parathyroid hormone appropriate to these objectives. Prevent the development of parathyroid hyperplasia.

Measures to normalize serum Ca2 : Appropriate calcium intake ± supplementation (including calcium-containing binders). Appropriate vitamin D treatment. Appropriate dialysate concentration. Therapeutic targets An area of healthy debate within nephrology. National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (2003) (see Table 3. 12) Guidelines developed by National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative refl ected the growing concern that chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder and its treatment might be associated with a potentially modifi able increase in CV risk.

Multiple studies, as well as national registry data, showed that current practice fell well short of achieving them.

    "text": "The principal differences are: Much less prescriptive. Less emphasis on attaining narrow Ca2 , PO, and parathyroid hormone targets, 4 e. g. the target for parathyroid hormone in pre-Dialysis chronic kidney disease is effectively removed beyond treatment of a progressively rising value. The guidelines generally recommend decision-making based on trends, rather than single values. The guidelines suggest there is no evidence to underpin a more stringent parathyroid hormone target, so focus on avoidance of risk at extremes of parathyroid hormone, i. e. at 2 x or 9 x normal in Dialysis patients. A multiplication range of 2 9 x normal is given, as opposed to an absolute range in pg/mL or pmol/L, because absolute parathyroid hormone levels can vary signifi cantly between assays. The guidelines read more as a summary of evidence, punctuated by pointers and advice, rather than dogmatic targets. Criticisms: the new broader parathyroid hormone targets risk letting the genie out of the bottle , with progressive hyperparathyroidism that could subsequently prove unstoppable. Additionally, some were expecting (and prefer) more prescriptive guidance.

(cid: 2) Very few statements in either guideline are based on High-quality evidence in fact, the only two recommendations graded 1A within the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes report are in areas within paediatric practice. This serves to Highlight the pressing need for RCTs to inform future guidelines in this area. 246 CHAPTER 3 Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder: hyperphosphataemia Control of phosphate PO control is the weak link in the therapeutic approach to chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder. 4 Dietary restriction Phosphate is contained in almost all foods (esp. meat, milk, eggs, cheese, yogurt, bran cereals, cola, chocolate drinks, beer, baked beans, dried peas (e. g. chick peas), nuts, and many convenience foods). It is diffi cult to balance dietary phosphate restriction against adequate Protein intake (recommended levels of daily dietary Protein provide 30 40mmol of phosphate). Patients are advised to reduce unnecessary PO intake (e. g. cola), so they can maintain an adequate Protein intake 4 (e. g. meat, eggs). Phosphate binders See Table 3. 14. Taken with meals to bind phosphate in the gut. The amount taken is proportional to size of meal (and, ideally, to its PO content) as well as 4 to serum PO (usually 1 3 tablets/meal). 4 Potency is modest, and some patients require large doses. GI side effects are frequent. 2 The most effective binder is one that the patient will take: demanding regimens unpalatable tablets poor compliance (50% Dialysis patients do not take their binders regularly). Should not be taken at the same time as iron supplements. Aluminium hydroxide is the most effective binder, but potential aluminium toxicity (skeletal and neurological) restricts its use (4 weeks). Calcium-containing phosphate binders (CCPBs) have been the mainstay: Not only bind PO, but help correct d Ca2 (and 6 suppress parathyroid hormone).",

    "text": "4 Patients receiving CCPBs are often in ve calcium balance, so they have been implicated as contributors to vascular calcifi cation (and adverse CV outcome). This can probably be avoided by limiting CCPB dose (and lowering dialysate calcium, e. g. to 1. 25mmol/L). CCPBs should be restricted to 1, 500mg elemental calcium/day, particularly if Low turnover disease likely (parathyroid hormone 2 x upper limit of normal). Avoid if hypercalcaemia. Non-calcium-based binders are preferred in patients with severe vascular and/or soft tissue calcifi cations. Non-calcium, non-aluminium-containing binders, e. g. sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel ) or carbonate (Renvela ) and lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol ), allow calcium and aluminium to be avoided. They are much more expensive than calciumor aluminium-based binders. Equally as effective as CCPBs. Sevelamer is associated with slower progression of coronary calcifi cation and possibly with improved survival. Sevelamer lowers LDL cholesterol and may provide additional CV risk reduction. chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder: HYPERPHOSPHATAEMIA 247 Magnesium-calcium combination binders, e. g. calcium acetate magnesium carbonate (Osvaren ), reduce calcium burden and appear cost-effective (SE: GI, including diarrheoa). The recent Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines suggest current available evidence does not favour a specifi c phosphate binder. Choice of agent in a particular patient should 6 be based on serum biochemistry, presence of vascular calcifi cation, and bone histology (if available). A local policy will usually be in place. One strategy is to use a combination of binding agents to reduce PO, 4 avoid excessive calcium administration, and ameliorate the cost of newer binders. Adequate Dialysis Dietary intake of PO exceeds daily removal by Dialysis. 4 A signifi cant amount of PO is in the intracellular compartment, so 4 signifi cant rebound occurs post-hemodialysis treatment. continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is more effi cient at PO removal than hemodialysis. 4 Poor PO control may be an indication for more frequent Dialysis. 4 Daily Dialysis regimens can control PO, with no binder requirement 4 (supplementation is often necessary! ). Aluminium toxicity History. In the 1970 80s, clusters of Dialysis units reported patients with aluminium toxicity. Investigation identifi ed a High geographic concentration in dialysate Water as the cause, and improved purifi cation techniques eliminated this route of exposure. Aluminium-containing phosphate binders were left as the main source. Presentation. Aluminium toxicity (l d parathyroid hormone secretion, d mineralization, and d osteoblastic activity) previously accounted for the majority of Low turnover bone pathology. This was often painful, with an i risk of fracture. Also: erythropoiesis-stimulating agent-resistant anaemia, encephalopathy, and neurotoxicity. Current practice. Aluminium-containing phosphate binders should generally be avoided (use for a limited period, e. g. 4 weeks, a possible exception). If extended use is necessary, aluminium levels should be monitored. Serum aluminium should be 20 micrograms/L (0. 7 μ mol/L) in Dialysis patients. Levels 60 micrograms/L (2. 2μ mol/L) suggest aluminium overload. Sequential levels may detect the development of overload in at-risk patients. However, serum aluminium is not a reliable indicator of overall body content, and a desferrioxamine (DFO) stimulation test may be required ( l rise in aluminium level after IV DFO). Symptomatic patients may benefi t from regular DFO chelation treatment. Interestingly, recent data suggest that long-term use of aluminium-based binders in Dialysis patients is not associated with toxicity as measured by desferrioxamine (DFO) stimulation test, so perhaps their clinical use is about to go full circle. 248 CHAPTER 3 Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) Table 3.",

    "text": "The conventional rationale is to suppress parathyroid hormone and control secondary hyperparathyroidism. Failure of the Kidney to produce 1, 25(OH) D is a key part of the 2 pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism, so it is logical that 1, 25(OH) D replacement 2 should form part of management. Vitamin D requires 1 A -hydroxylation in the Kidney for activation. In renal failure, this can be pharmacologically bypassed by using the 1 A -hydroxylated analogues calcitriol or alfacalcidol (1A -calcidol). Newer vitamin D analogues, (e. g. paricalcitol or doxercalciferol) provide alternatives. There is evidence (retrospective studies) that mortality d in Dialysis patients taking vitamin D, compared with those who do not. A newer justifi cation for vitamin D treatment is correction of vitamin D substrate defi ciency, using non-activated vitamin D products (colecalciferol, ergocalciferol). Largely based on theoretical benefi ts (see Box 3. 3) and assumes independent benefi ts for non-activated vitamin D via local conversion of 25(OH)D l 1, 25(OH) D (autocrine effects) in a wide range of target tissues. See also b p. 2 208. Treatment: control of secondary hyperparathyroidism 2 Control serum phosphate fi rst. Start with a Low dose (0. 25 micrograms/day alfacalcidol PO), and increase, as necessary, over several weeks (rarely, 0. 5 1. 0 micrograms/day). See b p. 244 for treatment targets; local policies may differ. Pulsed oral and IV therapy (usually 0. 5 2. 0 micrograms x 3/week) are an alternative to daily regimens and appear equally effi cacious. Giving therapy, either IV or oral, during a Dialysis treatment can aid compliance. Monitoring Monitor serum Ca2 , PO, and parathyroid hormone (monthly initially). 4 Avoid i Ca2 and parathyroid hormone oversuppression. S ide effects and toxicity i calcium 2 and i CaxP (i GI absorption and i mobilization from bone) frequently complicate treatment. More than just a therapeutic inconvenience, this has implications for bone turnover ( l ABD), soft tissue/vascular calcifi cation, and CV morbidity/mortality ( b p. 242). Treatment: nutritional vitamin D defi ciency Low serum 25(OH)D (calcidiol) levels are very common in patients with chronic kidney disease (15ng/mL in 7 20% if glomerular filtration rate 30mL/min). Probable cause: comorbidity l sedentary indoor lifestyle l insuffi cient sunlight exposure l d available vitamin D substrate (rather than poor dietary intake or a renal abnormality). Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines recommend screening in chronic kidney disease stages 3 5. Serum 25(OH)D 30ng/mL (75nmol/L) represents insuffi ciency, but there is no real consensus on what defi nes adequate levels. Usually treated with colecalciferol in formulations with calcium, e. g. calcium 600mg with D3 400 units (one tablet bd). An alternative is chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder: VITAMIN D TREATMENT 251 colecalciferol D3 as 20, 000 unit capsules: two capsules once daily for 7 days, then maintenance 2 x 20, 000 unit capsules x 1/month. However, there is no current consensus on repletion strategies. These doses may actually have limited effects on vitamin D stores. The benefi ts are not clear, but treatment appears very safe (with little risk of i Ca2 , i CaxP, or parathyroid hormone oversuppression, though modest reduction in parathyroid hormone may be seen). Box 3. 3 Vitamin D: beyond mineral metabolism Vitamin D-dependent genes are infl uenced through an intracellular vitamin D receptor (VDR). In addition to its classical role in mineral metabolism, vitamin D is now known to exert various non-classical effects on cell function, including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.

Vitamin D is involved in immune and infl ammatory responses, the renal artery stenosis, and development of myocardial hypertrophy. It has been implicated (on epidemiological and biological evidence) in the pathogenesis of several disorders, including psoriasis, various cancers, Diabetes mellitus, and i blood pressure. 25(OH)D (calcidiol) is the major circulating form of vitamin D and is measured in routine lab testing. Circulating 1, 25(OH) D (calcitriol) 2 levels are 1, 000-fold lower and much more diffi cult to estimate. 25(OH)D may have benefi ts independent of renal conversion and is a better indicator of overall vitamin D status than 1, 25(OH) D. 2 Newer vitamin D analogues Much attention has been given to the development of vitamin D analogues that suppress parathyroid hormone, with less propensity to hypercalcaemia. Various mechanisms are proposed for this selective action, including less GI Ca2 absorption. They are members of a group of compounds known as vitamin D receptor agonists (VDRAs) or active vitamin D compounds . Many have shown potential in the experimental setting, and a few are available for clinical use (e. g. paricalcitol, 22-oxacalcitrol, and doxercalciferol). Widely used outside the UK, especially the USA and Japan. They potently suppress parathyroid hormone, but i Ca2 and i CaxP do still occur. Advantages over calcitriol and alfacalcidol remain unproven, though there may be marginal benefi ts. X A large retrospective cohort study suggested a possible survival advantage for patients treated with paricalcitol. A therapeutic trial may be warranted in patients prone to i calcium 2. Paricalcitol is given IV on Dialysis (initially, dose is baseline parathyroid hormone in pg/mL divided by 80). An oral formulation is also available.

In this respect, they 4 differ importantly from other available treatments (see Table 3. 15). Side effects: dose-dependent upper GI intolerance, modest d calcium 2 frequent (though rarely problematic).

From the biochemical standpoint, therapy (vitamin D or calcimimetic) can be chosen, according to the clinical phenotype of the patient (see Table 3. 16). The vitamin D phenotype : the secondary hyperparathyroidism patient in whom serum calcium 2, PO, and CaxP product are all Low normal or subnormal. Vitamin 4 D therapy is usually effective in bringing biochemical parameters to target. Risk of i Ca2 or i PO is relatively Low. 4 The calcimimetic phenotype : potentially more diffi cult to treat. Here, secondary hyperparathyroidism is accompanied by a High normal or frankly elevated Ca2 , often with i PO and CaxP product. Treatment with vitamin 4 D will d parathyroid hormone but aggravate i calcium 2 and i PO. 4 chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder: CALCIMIMETICS 253 Vitamin D and calcimimetics work well together. Their modes of action at the level of the parathyroid are different, and effects on parathyroid hormone suppression appear additive. Calcimimetics may d serum Ca2 , making room for the use of vitamin D analogues. Dosing: cinacalcet (Mimpara UK, Sensipar USA) Oral; initially, 30mg od, increased incrementally (60mg, 90mg, 120mg, 180mg), as necessary, to maintain target parathyroid hormone. Check calcium 2 2 weeks after starting treatment and after any dose change. Hypocalcaemia may require dose reduction. calcium 2 usually checked monthly for fi rst 6 months and parathyroid hormone 2 3-monthly.

Indications Tertiary or autonomous hyperparathyroidism: failure of hyperplasic, overactive glands to suppress adequately in response to optimal medical therapy. Manifests clinically as i parathyroid hormone (usually 500pg/mL), with persistent i calcium 2. PO and alkaline phosphatase are usually raised. 4 If calcium is Low or normal, i parathyroid hormone indicates secondary hyperparathyroidism, and further medical treatment is necessary. Calcimimetic therapy ( b p. 252) may prove to have a role in reducing the need for parathyroidectomy and may be an alternative in those in whom surgery has failed, is refused, or is deemed too High risk. Inappropriate parathyroidectomy may have deleterious consequences for the skeleton ( l Low turnover disease). Pre-op considerations Imaging. Isotope scans (e. g. MIBI) allow localization of the parathyroid glands prior to surgery and identify ectopic (e. g. retrosternal) tissue. USS and computed tomography can also be helpful (speak to your surgeon). ENT.

Partial parathyroidectomy. Parathyroid tissue is deliberately left behind in an attempt to avoid the deleterious consequences of absent parathyroid hormone (principally ABD). Unfortunately, further autonomous parathyroid hormone secretion often necessitates repeat (and technically more diffi cult) surgery. Total parathyroidectomy with reimplantation. Parathyroid tissue is implanted into an extraparathyroid site (usually the arm). This tissue is then more easily accessible if recurrent hyperparathyroidism develops. Unfortunately, parathyroid regrowth in the neck remains common; the implant may fail to take , or the implant itself may become autonomous or even locally invasive. Total parathyroidectomy. Attempted removal of all parathyroid tissue. Leaves the patient hypoparathyroid, with risk of ABD. Serum calcium is subsequently maintained with calcitriol or alfacalcidol. Regrowth of islands of parathyroid cells is not uncommon. Small nests of residual cells often mean that serum parathyroid hormone will increase with time. Radiological ablation. Ultrasound localization and ablation through ethanol injection has met with limited success. Direct injection of active vitamin D compounds into the largest gland(s) is successfully used in some countries. 256 CHAPTER 3 Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) Calcifi c uraemic arteriolopathy (calciphylaxis) Defi nition Calcifi c uraemic arteriolopathy (CUA), or calciphylaxis, is a small vessel vasculopathy involving mural calcifi cation, with intimal proliferation, fi brosis, and thrombosis. It occurs predominantly in individuals with renal failure and results in ischaemia and necrosis of skin, soft tissue, visceral organs, and skeletal muscle. Incidence First described in 1962, but better recognition in recent years has contributed to an increasing incidence. However, recent estimates of a 4% prevalence in end-stage renal disease programmes are probably too High (closer to 7 1%). 2 Mortality 7 45% at 1 year (almost always due to sepsis). Pathogenesis is poorly understood. Abnormal skeletal and mineral metabolism certainly appears to play an important role, but many patients do not have uncontrolled chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder at the time of presentation. Reduction in key inhibitors of calcifi cation (e. g. fetuin-A, matrix Gla protein), an increase in reactive oxygen species, and infl ammatory cytokines all contribute. Multiple risk factors, some of which are iatrogenic, have been documented. What creates a p erfect storm for the development of CUA in an individual patient remains undetermined. Risk factors Uraemia (though also seen post-transplantation and in primary HPT).",

Measurement of nutritional status 2 No single parameter should be considered in isolation. Assessment should include: History and examination to identify ongoing medical problems that may limit nutritional intake psychosocial issues may be important. Dietary interview or diary. Quantitative intake of nutrients. Subjective global assessment (SGA). SGA is based on subjective and objective assessment of several patient parameters, including factors in the history and examination, GI symptoms, body weight patterns, functional capacity, and the presence of comorbid conditions that may infl uence nutritional requirements. Patients are assigned to one of three nutritional states: (i) well nourished; (ii) mild to moderately malnourished, or (iii) severely malnourished. This simple score is well validated in chronic kidney disease and powerful enough to predict outcome. 4 Anthropometric measurements. body mass index, skinfold thickness, estimated % weight loss, and mid-arm muscle circumference.

Adequacy of Dialysis. Inadequate Dialysis is a common contributing factor to malnutrition (uraemic toxins are anorectic and proinfl ammatory). Dialysis adequacy should be assessed in conjunction with the normalized Protein catabolic rate (nPCR), which is a measure of the rate of urea formation. When a patient is in steady state, urea formation correlates with Protein intake and Protein breakdown. Fluid restriction chronic kidney disease stages 4 5. Fluid and salt restriction are often important to prevent volume overload. On Dialysis. When the Urine output drops, fl uid restriction is vital to minimize weight gains. Aim for weight gains of 1 1. 5kg or less/day. In an anuric patient, this means a fl uid restriction of 750 1, 000mL. 2 This must be combined with salt restriction. Protein intake Intake averages 7 80g/day in the developed world, although requirements may be only 50g. A Low-Protein diet has been shown to slow the progression of renal failure in patients with chronic kidney disease ( b p. 208). Set against this is the danger of patients reaching Dialysis with signifi cant malnutrition. Most advocate no more than m oderate Protein restriction. Daily Protein targets: 0. 8 1. 0g/kg per day for chronic kidney disease stages 4 5. 1. 2g/kg per day when on Dialysis. Protein sources include meat, fi social history, eggs, milk, nuts, pulses, and beans. DIET AND NUTRITION IN chronic kidney disease 259 Carbohydrate intake Adequate energy intake is essential for patients with chronic kidney disease, especially those undergoing Protein restriction. Target 30 35kcal/kg per day. Sources: mainly complex carbohydrates, some from monoor polyunsaturated fats. Combining a diabetic diet with a renal diet can be diffi cult and requires expert support. Examples: Glucose, jams, marmalade, specialist High-energy renal drinks. Phosphate restriction (see also b p. 246) The Kidney is the main route of phosphate excretion. Aim to restrict dietary phosphate to 0. 8 1g/day, and target a serum phosphate in the normal physiological range. Prescribe phosphate binders if dietary restriction alone fails ( b p. 246). Phosphate-rich foods include all Protein-containing foods, making phosphate restriction diffi cult to achieve. Examples: milk, cheese, custard, yogurt, ice cream, cola, chocolate drinks, beer, Liver, baked beans, dried peas and beans (e. g. chick peas), nuts, wholegrain products, bran cereals, and, many, many convenience foods. Potassium restriction Typical UK intake 7 50 120mmol/day. With failing renal function, potassium excretion falls, making restriction necessary (esp. in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ARBs, and/or mineralocorticoid antagonists, such as spironolactone). potassium -rich foods include dairy products, potatoes (baked, chips, and crisps), some fruits (bananas, grapes, dried fruit, fresh pineapple), fresh fruit juice, tomatoes, sweet corn, mushrooms, chocolate, and coffee. Salt restriction Typical UK intake 7 150 200mmol/day (or 9 12g). This is a vast excess over physiological needs. Salt restriction is helpful if i blood pressure ± volume overload (helps reduce thirst and hence fl uid intake). Aim for an intake of 100mmol/day (5 6g). sodium -rich foods include cheese, salted butter/margarine, salted meat (bacon, ham, corned and luncheon meats), tinned meat, vegetables and soups, crisps, soy sauce, many breads and cereals, salted nuts, processed foods, and packaged meals. There are several resources on the internet that can help patients and their families to understand and adjust to these dietary restrictions.

Contributors include: Anorectic uraemic toxins (e. g. leptin). Chronic Low-grade infl ammation. Dietary restrictions (Low-Protein diet, unbalanced Low-phosphate diet). Medication (phosphate binders, oral iron). Dialysis itself (esp. continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis where Protein losses into the dialysate may be 1 2g/L or 7 10g/day; this would be considered nephrotic range if lost in the Urine! ). Managing malnutrition in the chronic kidney disease patient Assess the severity of malnutrition ( b p. 258). Measure current nutritional intake. Address correctable factors: 2 Correct under-Dialysis (e. g. change modality, improve access, increase treatment time). Seek and treat occult infection. Investigate and treat GI problems, e. g. gastroparesis. Defi ne and intervene if psychosocial problems. Consider dietary supplements: Wide range available. Renal-specifi c oral supplements are Low in potassium and PO and are also 4 concentrated (limiting the volume of fl uid). Overnight nasoenteral (or PEG) feeding may be benefi cial in more severe cases of malnutrition when adequate oral intake cannot be maintained. IDPN (intradialytic parenteral nutrition). Given on Dialysis, it provides amino acids, glucose, and lipids. It is not a substitute for oral supplements but can deliver 7 1, 500kcal/session (of which at least 7 500kcal are lost in dialysate! ). However, it can be a useful adjunct if the patient is able to manage 50% of the desired daily intake by mouth. Expensive. X Amino acid containing peritoneal dialysis solutions (Nutrineal ) may offer benefi t in malnourished peritoneal dialysis patients. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) should be reserved for those who cannot be fed enterally. Electrolyte quantities (particularly Potassium, phosphate, and magnesium) should be reduced and monitored daily. X Appetite stimulants/anabolic agents are of uncertain benefi t: Growth hormone (costly and long-term benefi t uncertain). Nandrolone (an androgen). MALNUTRITION IN chronic kidney disease 261 Infl ammation in chronic kidney disease Patients with chronic kidney disease have ongoing Low-grade infl ammation, with i acute phase proteins (CRP, ferritin), i infl ammatory cytokines, hypoalbuminaemia, and hypercholesterolaemia. Contributors include: Repeated infections. Oxidant stress ( d levels of antioxidants, i oxidative and carbonyl stress). Accumulation of AGEs. Arteriosclerosis and abnormal endothelial function. Malnutrition (both a cause and an effect of chronic infl ammation). Protein energy malnutrition may coexist there is increasing evidence that chronic infl ammation and oxidant stress increase metabolic demands and predispose to malnutrition. The triad of malnutrition, infl ammation, and accelerated atherosclerosis has been labelled the MIA syndrome. A vicious cycle may ensue, often culminating in death from cardiac disease. This may account for the apparent paradox that patients on Dialysis with a higher body mass index tend to survive longer. 262 CHAPTER 3 Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) Endocrine problems in chronic kidney disease Thyroid function Tests may be diffi cult to interpret, as thyroid-binding globulin is lost in the Urine if heavy proteinuria, causing a d measured T4.

Early menopause Not associated with chronic kidney disease per se but may occur in patients treated with cyclophosphamide or other cytotoxic agents. ENDOCRINE PROBLEMS IN chronic kidney disease 263 Growth retardation in chronic kidney disease Resistance to growth hormone (GH) is an important consequence of advanced chronic kidney disease. Although circulating GH levels are normal (or elevated), resistance to its action causes growth retardation in children and muscle wasting in adults. This resistance is the consequence of multiple defects in the GH/IGF-1 axis: GH receptor expression is downregulated, as is the activity of the downstream JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway. The expression and activity of IGF-1 (a major mediator of GH action) are also signifi cantly reduced. Growth delay can now be treated with recombinant GH. Other contributors to growth retardation are steroid therapy, malnutrition, and osteodystrophy. 264 CHAPTER 3 Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) chronic kidney disease management overview General advice (all stages) Exclude acute kidney injury. Explanation, education, and reassurance regarding the causes and consequences of chronic kidney disease. Smoking cessation. Weight reduction if obese. Encourage aerobic exercise.

Diagnose and manage treatable Kidney disease. Identify and control risk factors for progression. Manage s complications, such as anaemia. Plan for RRT in patients progressing to Kidney failure. It is not possible, or necessary, for all chronic kidney disease patients to be seen in specialist clinics. Referral guidelines Even if seen for specialist review, subsequent follow-up can continue in primary care, with appropriate shared care protocols. Consider referral if: estimated glomerular filtration rate 30mL/min. estimated glomerular filtration rate 60mL/min, and any of: Progressive fall (5mL/min in 1 year or 10mL/min in 5 years). Microscopic haematuria. Proteinuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 70mg/mmol, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 100mg/mmol) unless known to be due to Diabetes and appropriately treated. 15% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate with commencement of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (? renovascular disease). Suspected systemic illness (e. g. SLE, myeloma). hemoglobin 11g/dL, with no other explanation. Abnormal calcium, phosphate, or parathyroid hormone. Refractory i blood pressure (150/90 despite three antihypertensive agents). estimated glomerular filtration rate 60mL/min and other evidence of renal disease/damage: urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 70 or urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 100mg/mmol. urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30 or urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 50mg/mmol and microscopic haematuria. Abnormal renal imaging, e. g. renal cysts. Other indications: 2 Suspected acute Kidney injury. 266 CHAPTER 3 Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) Advanced chronic kidney disease care The transition from chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal disease is a physically and psychologically demanding time (see Fig. 3. 8). Such patients are best cared for by a multidisciplinary team (see 7 6-weekly, more often in the latter stages), with attention to: Ongoing measures to minimize rate of progression. Dietary intervention. Active management of complications (anaemia, chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder, malnutrition). Pre-Dialysis counselling: choice of Dialysis modality, individualized advice and support in the decision-making process. Pre-Dialysis and pre-transplant information and support sessions. Ideally involving expert patients (peer supporters); see Education. Preparation for transplantation: education; identify potential living donors. 2 Pre-emptive transplantation should be the goal, if possible. Formation of Dialysis access (surgical review at least 6 months prior to start of Dialysis is desirable). Access to palliative services for those who elect not to undertake Dialysis treatment or to help manage symptom burden. Timing initiation of Dialysis avoid symptomatic uraemia. Composition of an advanced chronic kidney disease clinic Nephrologist. Specialist nurses (e. g. pre-Dialysis counselling, anaemia management, pre-transplant assessment, Dialysis access preparation, palliative care). Renal dietitian.

ADVANCED chronic kidney disease CARE 267 When to start Dialysis The IDEAL study compared early (estimated glomerular filtration rate 10 15mL/min) vs late (5 7mL/min) commencement of Dialysis and showed no survival benefi t. However, quality of life is just as important a consideration. Guidelines recommend considering the commencement of Dialysis when glomerular filtration rate 15mL/min. However, this requires careful discussion with the patient and consideration of the risks and benefi ts associated with RRT. Symptoms and signs of advanced chronic kidney disease (e. g. persistent nausea and Vomiting, anorexia, malnutrition, volume overload, restless eggs), comorbidity, functional status, and physical and the psychological and social consequences of starting Dialysis all need to be taken into account. glomerular filtration rate ≤ 5 7mL/min, whether symptomatic or not. Refractory hyperkalaemia, acidosis, pulmonary oedema, pericarditis, encephalopathy, and neuropathy are all (urgent) indications for Dialysis (the aim should be to start Dialysis before these are present). 2 Pre-emptive transplantation is the treatment of choice of end-stage renal disease. Consider when glomerular filtration rate 20mL/min. If not possible, discuss whether a home-based therapy (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) is suitable. Early planning leads to improved choice. Fig. 3. 8 A pathway of care for advanced chronic kidney disease. Crash landers (or unplanned starters): these individuals are unknown to renal services and present as emergencies within 90 days of needing RRT (7 25 30% of patients entering end-stage renal disease programmes annually). They miss out on pre-emptive education, usually start on hemodialysis with temporary vascular access, and have worse outcomes in general.

Over half of patients who follow a conservative (i. e. non-dialytic) management pathway report poor mobility, weakness, Pain, and pruritus, and over one-third report poor appetite, diffi culty sleeping, drowsiness, dyspnoea, and constipation. With proactive identifi cation and management, the distress and disability caused by these symptoms can be considerably eased (see Table 3. 17). Many units now run a service specifi cally for such patients, concentrating resources and care to provide physical and social support. Patients may become increasingly reliant on family members and other carers. District nurses, social workers, home care teams, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and hospice services should be involved, as required.

For such patients, continuing supportive care without commencing Dialysis may allow a better quality of life, with little or no reduction in life expectancy. The decision whether to commence Dialysis at end-stage renal disease is ultimately made by the patient (assuming the patient has capacity). The renal team has a duty to ensure that this decision is as informed as possible by explaining the implications of withholding Dialysis and the pros and cons of commencing it. Family members should also be involved. The process cannot be rushed. A decision not to accept Dialysis should be made over time and be consistently held. Patients may (and often do) change their minds (in either direction). If severely uraemic, a patient may be unable to be involved in the decision-making process. It can be diffi cult to determine whether debility is uraemic in origin (and 6 potentially reversible) or s to pre-existing comorbidity. Patients referred late have no time to go through the pre-Dialysis counselling process and may be denied the opportunity to make informed decisions about their care. Withdrawal of Dialysis As with the decision of not to start Dialysis, the decision to withdraw should be made by the patient with the help and support of the multidisciplinary team. Withdrawal means that death will probably occur within a few days if the patient has no signifi cant residual renal function.",

Less often, it is the culmination of a number of smaller events, which have, in the view of the patient, had unacceptable consequences for their quality of life. Depression should be looked for and treated. The decision to withdraw should be made over a period of time and be held consistently. Care of the dying patient The patient should be able to die peacefully and with dignity, in a place of his or her choosing, surrounded by loved ones. This requires planning so that care at home, in a hospice, or in hospital can be arranged at short notice. Agreed care pathways may facilitate the management of the last few days of life. Family support: before death, family members may be involved in the physical care of the patient and need support and help. At the time of death and afterwards, help should be available to cope with the grieving process (this will need to be culturally appropriate). CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT OF chronic kidney disease: GENERAL 271 Analgesia in advanced chronic kidney disease Pain is under-recognized and undertreated in patients with Kidney disease. The fact that it is more diffi cult to treat is no excuse for inadequate management. Opiate analgesia is very effective but must be used with caution. Accumulation l signifi cant side effects: constipation, drowsiness, confusion, respiratory depression, twitching, and seizures. If uncertain, seek expert Pain advice. Use the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder. Step 1 Paracetamol: safe and effective in chronic kidney disease. Requires no dose adjustment. NSAIDs: Usually contraindicated (pre-Dialysis l deterioration in glomerular filtration rate; Dialysis l d residual renal function). Can be an effective short-term measure, esp. musculoskeletal Pain. Co-prescribe a proton pump inhibitor, as gastritis common. Step 2 Tramadol: 90% renally excreted, so d dose and i interval (start 50mg 12h). Avoid codeine and dihydrocodeine if estimated glomerular filtration rate 15mL/min. (cid: 2) Hepatic metabolites accumulate in chronic kidney disease. If used, reduce dose by 50%. Step 3 Drug choice will depend on acuteness and severity of Pain, desirable route of administration, and local availability. SC can be used for rapid relief, with subsequent conversion to oral or transdermal. Morphine or diamorphine: (cid: 2) Avoid, if possible, as breakdown products accumulate. If used short-term morphine: initially 2. 5mg SC 4 12h as needed. Diamorphine: initially 1. 25mg SC 4 12h as needed. Buprenorphine: Effective. Nausea a prominent side effect. 200 400 micrograms sublingual or transdermal patches. Alfentanil: First-line SC opioid in renal failure. SC 250 micrograms 24h. Can be given as a continuous infusion. Use fentanyl for breakthrough, as alfentanil has short half-life. Fentanyl: 10% renally excreted. SC 25 micrograms 3 6h. Lozenges for breakthrough Pain. Transdermal patch very effective once Pain controlled by other means. Hydromorphone: initially 1. 3mg orally 6 8-hourly 1. 3mg as needed for more severe Pain. Oxycodone: start with OxyNorm (initially 2. 5mg 8 12h) for rapid Pain control, and convert to OxyContin for less frequent administration. Methadone: hepatic metabolites excreted in faeces. However, large interpatient pharmacokinetic variability means it should probably be reserved for use by physicians familiar with its eccentricities.",

Remove or regulate other electrolytes (e. g. potassium, Ca2 , Mg2 , PO ). 4 Remove waste products of metabolism (Ur and creatinine are measured routinely, but there are many others). Make erythropoietin. 1 A -hydroxylate (and 6 activate) vitamin D. Dialysis acts as surrogate for all but the last two of these (which can be achieved pharmacologically). Even at best, it is only partially effective. Transplantation more completely (but still partially) replaces normal kidney function and should be regarded as the optimum treatment of end-stage renal disease. Transplanted patients survive longer and have a better quality of life. However, not everyone is fi t for transplantation end-stage renal disease patients are often frail, with appreciable comorbidity, especially vascular disease.

The tariff for hospital or satellite based hemodialysis in the UK is currently 723, 000 per annum, depending on locality (with a bestpractice supplement for those dialysing through an AV fi stula). Although all modalities are expensive, transplantation is the most cost effective (but only after the fi rst year). In the ultrasound (2011), Medicare expenditure on RRT rose to 730 billion (725 billion hemodialysis, 1. 5 billion peritoneal dialysis, 73 billion transplantation). Per patient per year the costs were: hemodialysis 788, 000, peritoneal dialysis 772, 000, transplant 733, 000. International data Prevalence rates of RRT vary across Europe and are often higher than in the UK. In the USA there were 7430, 000 prevalent Dialysis patients in 2011 (hemodialysis 7395, 000, peritoneal dialysis 731, 500). However, the annual growth rate (3. 4%) was the lowest for 30 years. Total end-stage renal disease prevalence was 1, 901 PMP. 7101, 000 patients started hemodialysis therapy in the ultrasound (80% of whom started on a Dialysis catheter, rather than with an arteriovenous fistula. An astonishing 40% had not seen a nephrologist prior to reaching end-stage renal disease), 77, 500 started peritoneal dialysis and 72, 500 received a pre-emptive transplant. 16% started RRT with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15mL/min or over. The overall adjusted incidence of end-stage renal disease in the ultrasound was 357 PMP (Caucasian 280 PMP, Black 940 PMP, Native American 453 PMP, Asian 399 PMP, Hispanic 518 PMP). Diabetes mellitus was the most common cause of end-stage renal disease, followed by hypertension (source: USRDS Annual Data Report 2013). Survival RRT patients age 3034 have a mortality rate 25x higher than the age matched general population (for patients age 85 it is still 73x higher). Median survival for patients starting RRT in the age group 4554 is currently 10. 5 years, for age 5564 it is 5. 6 years and for age 6574, 3 years. The relative risk of death for prevalent RRT patients (UK 2010) was 6. 6. Diabetic patients have worse survival than non-diabetic patients. The survival in older age groups is only slightly better than in patients with lung cancer.

Reproduced from UK Renal Registry 15th Annual Report: UK Renal Registry (2012), with permission. 278 CHAPTER 4 Dialysis Haemodialysis (hemodialysis) Overview During Dialysis, Blood is exposed to dialysate (with physiological concentrations of electrolytes) across a semi-permeable membrane. Small molecules such as Ur (MW 60Da), creatinine (MW113Da) and electrolytes pass through pores in the membrane. Large molecules such as albumin (MW 60, 000Da), IgG (MW 140, 000Da) and Blood cells do not. Concentration differences across the membrane allow molecules to diffuse down a gradient. This allows waste products to be removed and desirable molecules or ions (e. g. HCO ) to be replaced. 3 Water can be driven through the membrane by hydrostatic force (ultrafi ltration, ultrafiltration). By varying the Hypertension gradient across the membrane (transmembrane Hypertension, TMP), Water removal can be controlled. In addition to a means to remove Water ( 7 1 4L) that has accumulated between Dialysis sessions (ingestion of fl uid, foods, and by-product of metabolism), ultrafiltration can also be used as a means of solute clearance by convection. What is required for haemodialysis? Dialysis membrane ( b p. 284): a biocompatible membrane with adequate surface area/permeability for solute clearance and ultrafi ltration. Dialysate ( b p. 282): of suffi cient purity and containing the required concentration of electrolytes. Effective control and safety mechanisms ( b p. 280): pumps for Blood and dialysate fl ow, TMP, temperature, detection of Blood leaks or air. Vascular access: large volumes of Blood are removed from a patient, exposed to a Dialysis membrane, and then returned. Options are: arteriovenous fistula fi stula: optimal form of vascular access (b p. 292). PTFE graft: second best ( b p. 292). Tunnelled, cuffed central venous catheter: ideally not long term (b p. 296). Temporary central venous catheter: for immediate use; e. g. in acute kidney injury. ( b p. 180). Anticoagulation ( b p. 290): prevents Blood clotting in the extracorporeal circuit. Haemodialysis and haemofi ltration Haemodialysis Solute clearance by diffusion (mainly). Dialysate is required. Diffusion is maximized by maintaining High-fl ow rates of Blood and dialysate and by pumping the two through the dialyser in countercurrent directions. Larger MW (20kDa) molecules are generally poorly removed. Usually administered intermittently (e. g. 4h, 3x/week). HAEMODIALYSIS (hemodialysis) 279 Haemofi ltration Solute clearance by convection (mainly). Achieved by generating a TMP across the membrane. No dialysate required. Large volumes need to be fi ltered to achieve adequate solute clearance. This would cause hypovolaemia unless replacement fl uid administered (usually pre-prepared 5 10L bags). Removes larger MW (30 50kDa) molecules (e. g. vitamin B12 and B2 microglobulin) more effi ciently than Dialysis. Continuous (24h) heart failure is associated with greater haemodynamic stability and often favoured for RRT in a critical care setting ( b p. 174). Haemodiafi ltration - Enhances clearance of middle molecules by combining diffusion (hemodialysis) and convection (heart failure) to obtain the best from both modalities. See fi gure 4. x. - Both dialysate and replacement fl uid are required. Online HDF (OL-HDF) uses ultrapure dialysate produced by the Dialysis machine as replacement fl uid.

Ultrapure Water is generated in a treatment plant (involves microfi lters, activated carbon, deionization, and reverse osmosis) to exclude particulate matter, ions, and minerals potentially harmful to humans (see Fig. 4. 4). UK Renal Association standards for Water purity are 0. 25IU/mL endotoxin, 100cfu/mL microbial count. H ions have a Low plasma concentration and are not removed by Dialysis. Buffer (alkali equivalent) is added to dialysate instead. Bicarbonate is now preferred to acetate as a buffer. hemodialysis machines either mix dialysate concentrate, buffer, and Water for the individual patient or this is done centrally before distribution around several machines. Ultrapure Water An average patient is exposed to 560L of Water during three hemodialysis sessions, so it must be of suffi cient purity to enter the bloodstream.

Carbon fi lters removes chlorine/chloramines to 0. 1mg/L (chloramines can lead to haemolysis). S ofteners remove Ca2 and Mg2 by ionic exchange, as hard Water can damage machines and cause muscle weakness. M icron fi lters remove suspended particles. R everse osmosis (RO) removes bacteria, endotoxins, pyrogens, viruses, and solutes (can lead to hypotension, nausea, Vomiting. ) Regular testing must ensure purity standards (see Box 4. 1). DIALYSATE 283 Dialysate concentrates Dialysate contains pure Water as well as several different concentrates: Sodium, Potassium, calcium, bicarbonate, magnesium, and glucose. In an ideal world, the proportions of each of these concentrates should be individualized for every hemodialysis patient. Potassium (potassium ) Around 80 140mmol is removed per hemodialysis session. The gradient of potassium between serum and dialysate is important, and most potassium is removed in the fi rst hour. Dialysate potassium varies from 1 to 3mmol/L. The higher the gradient, the more the potassium removal which is associated with a greater risk of haemodynamic instability. Sodium (sodium ) Dialysate sodium concentration controls salt and Water removal from the plasma (see b p. 301). Bicarbonate (HCO ) 3 hemodialysis aims to ameliorate a pre-Dialysis acidosis without causing a post-Dialysis alkalosis. Dialysate concentrations vary from 36 to 40mmol/L.

As it only partially replaces renal function, fl uid and dietary restrictions remain signifi cant and burdensome. Dialysis can be considered adequate if it provides relief of uraemic symptoms and controls acidosis, fl uid balance, and serum potassium. It should also allow a feeling of physical and psychological well-being. Aspects of Dialysis adequacy Solute clearance. Small molecule clearance is relatively easy to measure ( b p. 287). Aim to achieve a target dialysis adequacy measure of 1. 2 or urea reduction ratio 65% (see box below). Blood Hypertension and fl uid balance. As a general rule, i blood pressure in a Dialysis patient should be treated by d dry weight (i. e. post-Dialysis weight). This should be the weight at which salt and Water balance is optimal. Oligo-anuric patients (majority of long-term hemodialysis patients) need to restrict their interdialytic salt and fl uid intake in order to achieve this, aiming for weight gains of 1 2. 5kg (maximum) between sessions. It is diffi cult to be achieve prescriptive blood pressure targets in the hemodialysis population (lack of evidence and a heterogeneous population). However, preand postDialysis blood pressure 140/90mmHg is desirable. This would preferably be achieved without anti-hypertensive medication. Interor intra-dialytic hypotension should be avoided. Nutrition. Blood Ur levels depend on rate of production as well as rate of excretion. (cid: 2) A Low pre-Dialysis Ur may refl ect poor nutrition, rather than Good Dialysis. Targets: Serum albumin 35g/L. Normalized Protein catabolic rate (nPCR) 1. 0g/kg/day (b p. 287). Acceptable anthropometric measures. Clearance of other molecules: Middle molecule clearance thought to be important to prevent the long-term complications of Dialysis. B microglobulin is the most 2 used marker. Phosphate clearance is also important and appears to correlate more with hours of Dialysis than rate of small molecule clearance. Quality of life and life expectancy.",

    "text": "Quality of life and life expectancy. There is a potential trade-off to be made between the number of hours spent on the machine (i Dialysis dose) and quality of life. For patients with a limited life expectancy, the latter may be a more important consideration (although reducing hours below 4h 3x week is only rarely indicated). Dialysis PRESCRIPTION AND ADEQUACY 287 Measuring Dialysis adequacy In the 1980s, the National Cooperative Dialysis Study (NCDS) established timed average Ur concentration as a determinant of morbidity and mortality on hemodialysis. Subsequent mathematical analysis of these data has led to the development of urea kinetic modelling (UKM) as the accepted method of measuring small solute clearance. dialysis adequacy measure is a measure of Ur clearance where: potassium dialyser urea clearance. t time on Dialysis. V volume of distribution of Ur (estimated from patient size). The s ingle pool dialysis adequacy measure assumes that, at the end of Dialysis, the concentrations of intracellular and extracellular Ur are equal: spKt/VlnUpost/Upre0. 008t43. 5Upost/Upre UFvol/wtpoost (Upre, urea pre-Dialysis; Upost, urea post-Dialysis; UFvol, volume removed on Dialysis) The two compartment model acknowledges that, in reality, it takes time for Ur to be redistributed post-Dialysis and that the extracellular Ur concentration is lower than intracellular. An equilibrated dialysis adequacy measure or eKt/V can be calculated from the spKt/V. A simpler measurement of Ur clearance is the u rea reduction ratio (urea reduction ratio), which does not take account of the amount of fl uid removed by ultrafi ltration. It is thus less accurate but has been shown to correlate with outcome: urea reduction ratio(1Upre/Upost)100 Normalized Protein catabolic rate (nPCR) A measure of Ur generation, which refl ects nutritional status. It can only be reliably used in patients who are stable so Ur generation will broadly refl ect Protein intake. It is felt that patients require an nPCR 1. 0g/kg/ day. nPCR of 0. 8g/kg/day is associated with higher mortality. Residual function When hemodialysis is fi rst commenced, residual renal function may contribute greatly to the total amount of solute clearance (Kru). This is usually calculated with a 24h Urine collection. Residual function tends to diminish quickly on hemodialysis (secondary to repetitive d blood pressure 9 bio-incompatibility) ( b p. 284). 288 CHAPTER 4 Dialysis Ensuring adequacy dialysis adequacy measure UK and ultrasound guidelines suggest a single pool dialysis adequacy measure 1. 2 for patients dialysed x 3/week, equating to a urea reduction ratio of 7 65%. The landmark HEMO study compared two target dialysis adequacy measure levels. Patients with a target dialysis adequacy measure of 1. 2 had no difference in mortality or cardiac events, compared to those with a dialysis adequacy measure of 1. 6. 2 Residual renal function should always be taken into account. Prescribed vs delivered dialysis adequacy measurevariables in the Dialysis prescription Most guidelines suggest monthly measurement of dialysis adequacy measure. Online methods of measuring dialysis adequacy measure are provided on modern Dialysis machines (often using sodium clearance to estimate urea clearance). If dialysis adequacy measure fails to meet target, options are to: Improve vascular access if fl ows are poor or if there is access recirculation, it will be hard to improve clearances. Increase Blood fl ow/larger needles b enefi cial if access reasonable. Increase dialyser size modest impact. Increase dialysate fl ow. Increase Dialysis time/frequency major benefi t. Consider HDF. Computer modelling software can help decide which elements of the prescription require modifi cation to improve dialysis adequacy measure. (cid: 2) hemodialysis adequacy is multifaceted. Achieving a desired dialysis adequacy measure does not necessarily equate to optimal Dialysis.",

    "text": "(cid: 2) hemodialysis adequacy is multifaceted. Achieving a desired dialysis adequacy measure does not necessarily equate to optimal Dialysis. Dialysis PRESCRIPTION AND ADEQUACY 289 Management of Dialysis patients on non-renal wards - For elective procedures, inform your renal team at the preassessment stage. On the day of admission contact them again (arrangements for routine Dialysis will need to be made). - 1 Many Dialysis patients are oligo-anuric, so DO NOT routinely administer IV fl uids (unless the patient is haemodynamically compromisedif so, use small boluses, assess volume status regularly and call for expert help). - 1 DO NOT give potassium supplementation. Discuss with renal team if being considered. - DO NOT place a urinary catheter unless there is a clear urological indication. Oligo-anuria is virtually universal in this patient group! - If the patient is clinically overloaded inform the renal team immediately, as the patient may require urgent Dialysis. - Check UE on admission. If potassium 5. 5 millimoles per liter inform renal team. - 1 When considering any new medication, check whether the drug is safe in end-stage renal disease and if a dose adjustment is required. Be particularly cautious with opiate analgesia and sedatives (accumulation! ). 2 See b p. 271 and discuss with the renal pharmacy team. - Check (and document) daily weight. - Does the patient have an arteriovenous fistula? NEVER insert an IV cannula into a fi stula arm. The back of the hand on the non-fi stula arm is the best site. - If patient has a Dialysis central venous catheter (central venous catheter), it should not be used for anything else but hemodialysis. - If a Dialysis patient undergoes a general anaesthetic, their potassium must be checked immediately on return to the ward. This potassium check cannot wait until the following morning, even if the GA procedure is performed late in the day or out of hours. If potassium 5. 5mmol/L inform the renal team - the patient may require Dialysis. - Peritoneal Dialysis (peritoneal dialysis) patients should ideally continue their own Dialysis throughout their hospital admission. Ocassionally this may be with the assistance of a relative or carer. Liaise with their peritoneal dialysis team. - If there is any concern that a patient will not be able to undertake their own peritoneal dialysis (e. g. confusion, neurological event, etc. ), inform the renal team ASAP, so that alternative arrangements can be made. 290 CHAPTER 4 Dialysis Anticoagulation Blood exposed to Dialysis lines and membranes in an extracorporeal circuit rapidly sees the induction of the extrinsic coagulation cascade. In order to ensure effi cient and adequate Dialysis, regular anticoagulation throughout the duration of each Dialysis session is required. Historically, this was provided by the use of unfractionated heparin (UFH) and, indeed, this is still the case in many parts of the world, including the USA. There has been a trend, in Europe, however, to adopt the Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) for standard anticoagulation. A 2004 meta-analysis of the safety and effi cacy of the LMWHs vs UFH concluded that there was no difference in the number of bleeding events, post-Dialysis vascular access compression time, or thrombosis of the extracorporeal circuit between the two. Unfractionated heparin Mixture of glycosaminoglycans between 3 and 30 kDa. Highly negatively charged. Indirect thrombin inhibitor. Narrow therapeutic window and highly variable dose response.

Platelet activation and aggregation results in thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and infarction. There are wide-ranging reports as to the prevalence of HIT antibodies in Dialysis patients, with fi gures varying between 0 and 18%. ANTICOAGULATION 291 Other Other options for anticoagulation include regional anticoagulation (UFH/ protamine, citrate, epoprostenol), heparin-coated dialyser, heparinoids (danaparoid or dermatan sulfate), or direct thrombin inhibitors (argatroban or hirudin). Some of these may be useful in those patients who develop HIT or those with a High bleeding risk. Bleeding 2 Patients with end-stage renal disease have an increased incidence rate of major bleeding. This has been quoted as 2. 5% per person-year for patients on haemodialysis. A recent study suggested that this increased to 3. 1% with warfarin use, 4. 4% with aspirin, and 6. 3% with warfarin and aspirin. (cid: 2) Caution when prescribing these agents in patients on haemodialysis. 292 CHAPTER 4 Dialysis Dialysis access: arteriovenous fistula/PTFE Reliable vascular access is the cornerstone of hemodialysis therapy, and timely planning of access creation is a major facet of chronic kidney disease care (see Fig. 4. 6). 7 25% of all admissions in the Dialysis population relate to access failure or other complication and remain an important source of morbidity and mortality. AV fi stula The optimal form of vascular access. Requires surgical anastomosis of an artery and a vein (under LA or GA), either at the wrist (radiocephalic) or elbow (brachiocephalic, brachiobasilic). If the suitability of veins is in doubt, then vascular mapping with USS is desirable. Maturation for 6 8 weeks (minimum) is required prior to needling ( 6 advance planning crucial). PTFE graft Second best. A synthetic graft is interposed between an artery and a vein. A larger operation than arteriovenous fistula creation. Necessary if veins inadequate to fashion an arteriovenous fistula (e. g. diabetes mellitus, previous phlebotomy/cannulation). Lower limb sites possible (e. g. femoral loop), in addition to upper limb. Useable within days, but thrombosis and infection (usually necessitating removal) are problematic. Half-life shorter than an arteriovenous fistula.

At the start of their Dialysis career, all patients should have a lifelong vascular access strategy; i. e. a planned approach to vascular access that preserves potential sites for as long as possible.

    "text": "Many centres have a multidisciplinary vascular access team for this purpose. Clinical examination and vessel mapping (duplex Doppler) help to plan the site of fi stula formation. A native fi stula takes at least 6 8 weeks to mature. A PTFE graft can often be used within 2 weeks. Primary failure rates for AV fi stulae (unusable at 3 months) remain High (up to 50% in some centres). In addition to technical factors, or poor arteriovenous fistula care, this may be caused by a vascular stenosis, either at the AV anastomosis or in the downstream vein. These may be amenable to angioplasty. Grafts have a lower primary failure rate, but are more likely to develop late stenoses either at the venous anastomosis or in the outfl ow vein. Fistula care: what every doctor and patient should know Dialysis access is extremely precious. Arm veins should be preserved in pre-Dialysis patients (no IV cannulae between elbow and wrist). Needling should only be carried out by a trained operator (usually a Dialysis nurse, ideally the patient). Technique: avoid using the same site repetitively ( l false aneurysm formation). Never put a tourniquet or blood pressure cuff on a fi stula arm. Do not use a fi stula to take Blood. Hypotension (and volume depletion) li thrombosis risk. i hematocrit (too much erythropoiesis-stimulating agent) predisposes to thrombosis. Keep within recommended guidelines and at the lower end of these, if at risk. A clotted fi stula or graft requires immediate attention (time to declotting is a major determinant of success). Surveillance Alongside clinical monitoring of signs that may indicate stenosis (diffi cult cannulation, prolonged bleeding post-needle removal), Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative have published guidelines for regular access screening. The rationale is that regular surveillance of vascular access should identify a stenosis and allow pre-emptive intervention to prevent thrombosis. The recommendations are that a referral for intervention should be triggered when Blood fl ow 600mL/min in a PTFE or 400 500mL/min in an arteriovenous fistula. While these guidelines are controversial (as they may potentially lead to a High number of unnecessary interventions), they can be helpful when correlated with clinical fi ndings such as access venous pressures and post Dialysis bleeding times. If a stenosis is suspected, investigate further by duplex or angiography (fi stulogram). The advantage of angiography is the potential ability to proceed immediately to an angioplasty ( fi stuloplasty ). 294 CHAPTER 4 Dialysis Clotted arteriovenous fistula/PTFE No thrill or buzz in fi stula thrombosis (ensure patients are aware of this) seek immediate medical opinion. Swift intervention (within 48h) either via interventional radiology (local thrombolysis), or surgery, may be able to salvage the fi stula. The longer the time to intervention, the less likely it is to be successful. There is no clear evidence for anticoagulation in the interim. Check UE and volume status, and insert a temporary Dialysis line, if required. Other complications of fi stulae and grafts Infection: fi stulae rarely become infected beyond a superfi cial cellulitis. PTFE infection is not uncommon. May be occult, causing weight loss, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent resistance, and failure to thrive. Antimicrobials rarely successful, and management usually involves surgical removal. Aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm formation: may occur at needling sites, especially if sites not rotated. Surgery may be necessary. Bleeding from an infected or aneurysmal arteriovenous fistula or graft is a much feared complication (proceeds under arterial Hypertension! ). 2 Wear a gown, gloves, and goggles. Seal the bleeding site with the lid of a universal container, and secure with a tight bandage. Establish wide-bore IV access; check clotting; cross-match Blood, and inform a surgeon.",

Dialysis ACCESS: arteriovenous fistula/PTFE 295 The golden rules of vascular access formation - Assess the patient for vascular access when Dialysis is expected within 12 months. - Make sure the patient resists venepuncture in the selected limb. - Use upper limbs before lower limbs. - Non-dominant arm before dominant. - Use distal sites (e. g. radiocephalic) before proximal (e. g. brachiocephalic) whenever possible. See Fig. 4. 7. - Use a native vein before prosthetic graft. - Aim for formation 6 months prior to Dialysis. This will give adequate time for maturation (and for repeat intervention in cases of primary non-function). - Ensure all access procedures and interventions (successful or unsuccessful) are adequately documented. - Plan aheadwhat next? Is peritoneal Dialysis an option? Fig. 4. 7 A mature radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula used for hemodialysis. 296 CHAPTER 4 Dialysis Haemodialysis access: lines If a patient has neither an arteriovenous fistula nor a PTFE, the remaining options are: Temporary Dialysis catheter ( b p. 180) For immediate use; e. g. acute kidney injury, or in a patient with unresolved sepsis. Internal jugular, subclavian and femoral are possible routes. Ideally leave in situ for ≤2 weeks (femoral 5 days). These have much higher infection rates than other forms of Dialysis access. Tunnelled (and cuffed) Dialysis catheter A dual-lumen (or two single-lumen) venous catheter is placed in a central vein (internal jugular or subclavian; femoral less common). Available for immediate use and usually left in situ for 1 3 months (occasionally longer). Blood fl ows 300 450mL/min achievable. The use of tunnelled central venous haemodialysis catheters (central venous catheter) is common. They are frequently used as a bridging step in those who are waiting for a fi stula or in those in whom access surgery has been unsuccessful. They should generally be viewed as a short-term solution, as they are associated with a 3-fold increased mortality, compared with AVFs. In addition, sepsis-related death is 100-fold greater in hemodialysis patients than the general population, and infection-related death and all-cause mortality is highest in those dialysing through a central venous catheter. Malfunction Catheter malfunction is common. 50% of lines fail within the fi rst year of insertion. Catheter malfunction is defi ned as one of the following: Peak Blood fl ow ≤ 200mL/min for 30min in an hemodialysis session. Mean Blood fl ow ≤ 200mL/min for two consecutive hemodialysis sessions. No fl ow, unable to initiate hemodialysis. Malfunction may be positional (usually ≤ 7 days post-insertion) or mechanical. Mechanical malfunction may be intraluminal (thrombosis), extraluminal (fi brin sheath), or intrinsic to the catheter material/properties. Fibrin sheaths will start to form within 24 hours of insertion and may eventually completely enclose the catheter. Can cause a one-way valve, manifesting in diffi cult aspiration despite easy injection.

Trisodium citrate (4, 30, or 46. 7%) has also been shown to be more effective than heparin and causes less bleeding, less biofi lm formation, and a signifi cant reduction in catheter-related bacteraemia. There are no convincing data for Low-dose warfarin, ticlopidine, or other antiplatelet agents with respect to primary prevention. HAEMODIALYSIS ACCESS: LINES 297 Treatment Initial attempts to restore fl ow: fl ush catheter with 10mL syringe of saline; reposition patient; reverse lines. Beware recirculation (repetitive Dialysis of the same small volume of Blood) and inadequate Dialysis. Thrombolytic agents: streptokinase/urokinase have largely been replaced by rtPA (alteplase, reteplase, tenecteplase). Differing regimens have been studied: push , short dwell (30 60min), long dwell (2 hours, interdialytic), or infusions. These methods are associated with short-term success of between 40 and 90%, with median patency 14 30 days. Fibrin sheath disruption: mechanical disruption of sheath from catheter wall. Published outcomes variable, presumably related to catheter type and operator technique. Exchange over guidewire: if previously listed measures unsuccessful, then consider a catheter exchange. Comparable infection rates to d e novo insertion and preserves vascular access, particularly if a central venous stenosis has developed. Cautiondo not use this technique when replacing fractured or split lines due to risk of bacteraemia. Catheter-related bacteraemia Catheter-related bacteraemia (CRB) is a serious complication of central venous catheter use. Catheters are associated with a 10-fold increase in bacteraemia rates vs arteriovenous fistula. Incidence of CRB used to range from 2. 5 to 6. 5 episodes/1, 000 catheter days for tunnelled lines and higher for temporary uncuffed lines.

Residual renal function or Urine output. Other fl uid losses (stoma output, stool losses, etc. ). As a general rule, hemodialysis patients should gain no more than 2% of their body weight in fl uid between sessions (1. 4kg in a 70kg adult). Gains of 4% (2. 8kg in a 70kg adult) are described as large interdialytic weight gains. But, as most hemodialysis patients will confi rm, this is easier said than done. Patients require encouragement and regular tailored advice regarding fl uid (and salt) intake. Dry weight (DW) It is the end-Dialysis weight thought to best represent a euvolaemic state. It is the body weight in kg against which the ultrafi ltration volume is set at each session. For example: hemodialysis patient with a dry weight of 70kg. Pre-Dialysis weight 72. 7kg. Target ultrafiltration volume 2, 700mL over 4h to achieve DW. Assessing DW Can be achieved in a number of ways but should always include clinical assessment. The point at which a patient experiences intradialytic hypotension (or unpleasant cramp) ( b p. 302) is a crude (and not always correct) indication that further fl uid removal will not be advantageous: Examination: to include presence or absence of ankle oedema, lying and standing blood pressure, JVP, and examination of the chest.

    "text": "Hypertension, oedema, and an elevated JVP suggest overload. Fluid gains between Dialysis sessions. Continuous Blood volume monitoring (BVM, on-line measurement of the haematocrit on hemodialysis where sudden haemoconcentration suggests vascular refi ll is failing and dry weight has been reached). Biofeedback control, a combination of BVM, conductivity, blood pressure, and ultrafiltration rate, analysed in real time to predict impending hypotension. Bioimpedance where resistance to alternating current is used to determine lean body mass and body fl uid volume. IVC: aorta ratio on ultrasound (predominantly a research tool). (cid: 2) Of these, only the fi rst two have entered routine practice trials of the other techniques have either been inadequate or results have been inconsistent. A widely applicable, and clinically useful, tool that accurately assesses fl uid status is awaited. FLUID BALANCE ON Dialysis 301 Sodium and Dialysis Any individual has a (remarkably stable) Sodium set-point : if their plasma sodium rises above their set-point, osmoreceptors trigger thirst until sodium returns to this point. The reverse is also true: if plasma sodium falls with total body sodium depletion, salt craving increases sodium ingestion to regain the set-point sodium . So it follows that: (cid: 2) D ietary salt intake is a vital part of haemodialysis patients salt balance! Achieving 100mmol/day intake (equivalent to 6g NaCl) is diffi cult on a western diet. The more salt ingested, the more Water will be drunk, and the more fl uid weight gained between sessions. During Dialysis, ultrafi ltration (convection) removes sodium, as does diffusion down a plasma/dialysate gradient. This gradient is not as simple as a patient s measured serum sodium, compared to the prescribed dialysate sodium : Plasma sodium is reported in millimoles per liter, but only 93% of plasma is free Water (so the true sodium in that fraction of dialysable Water is higher ). Negatively charged plasma proteins resist movement of sodium from plasma into dialysate (Gibbs Donnan effect), affecting true diffusion. As long as dietary salt intake is controlled to 100mmol/day Lowering the dialysate sodium will lead to a negative sodium balance over time. BUT may be associated with more intradialytic haemodynamic instability over the short term. Higher dialysate sodium l increased fl uid intake and larger interdialytic weight gains over time. BUT may be associated with better haemodynamic control during any one session (allows for better capillary refi lling during ultrafi ltration). 302 CHAPTER 4 Dialysis Intradialytic hypotension A sudden and symptomatic fall in blood pressure during a Dialysis session is called intradialytic hypotension (IDH). During ultrafi ltration, fl uid is removed from the vascular space. This requires prompt refi lling from the ECF to maintain Blood volume. Healthy adults will tolerate up to 25% reduction in Blood volume, but, amongst patients on Dialysis, there is large interand intrapatient variability. IDH is defi ned as a fall in SBP 20mmHg (or MAP 10), associated with symptoms, or a fall to SBP 100mmHg. Symptoms associated with IDH include: Cramps, abdominal Pain, or nausea (reduced gut perfusion). Yawning, sighing, anxiety, or dizziness (reduced cerebral perfusion). Chest Pain or arrhythmias. IDH occurs in around 10% of all hemodialysis patients and in around 5 3 0% of these patients sessions. IDH is always related to the rate of ultrafi ltration (i. e. the speed of fl uid removal). It is less usual at ultrafiltration rate 0. 3mL/min/kg and common if ultrafiltration rate 0. 6mL/min/kg. IDH is more likely in: Elderly (esp. if with wide pulse Hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension). . Diabetic patients ( 2 with autonomic neuropathy). Cardiomyopathies. Occult sepsis. Immediate management of IDH: Stop ultrafi ltration (ultrafiltration).",

INTRADIALYTIC HYPOTENSION 303 Management: preventing IDH Maintain residual renal function where possible. Confi rm cardiac function (ECG, echo) and exclude valvular Heart disease. Give Good dietary salt and fl uid intake advice. Patients who do not understand the importance of salt restriction on hemodialysis will fi nd controlling thirst and fl uid very diffi cult. Avoid eating during hemodialysis. Stop Dialysis-day antihypertensives (but try to continue B -blockers if prescribed). Control Blood sugars in diabetic patients. Correct anaemia, if present, and arrange nutritional input for those who are malnourished. Increase Dialysis hours or increase number of weekly sessions (i. e. reduce the ultrafiltration rate or the ultrafiltration volume per session). Cooling the dialysate Dialysis is often a warming event if the dialysate temperature were set at 37, the metabolic consequences of the process and of pyrogens and cytokines released through Bloodmembrane interaction would l a gain in energy. Warming l peripheral vasodilatation B P will then only be maintained if Heart rate or stroke volume increases (or both). Patients on Dialysis often have a multifactorial uraemic cardiomyopathy during Dialysis, ischaemic regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs) are visible on echocardiography in a signifi cant subgroup of patients prone to IDH (as O delivery fails to meet cardiac work). Reducing the dialysate tempe 2 rature to 36 or even 35. 5 l cooler returned Blood during any session, with vasoconstriction, then sustaining or raising Blood Hypertension without tachycardia or increased myocardial contractility. 2 Cooled dialysate reduces IDH and prevents RWMAs. Sodium profi ling Sodium ramping , or profi ling, has not become widely adopted to control IDH although a higher dialysate sodium during the fi rst hour of Dialysis, which then falls on an hour-by-hour (or shorter) basis, should improve haemodynamic stability. The total sodium load tends to be higher than with fi xed concentration (standard) dialysate sodium . So a higher load then drives intradialytic thirst and fl uid gains, setting up a cycle of large intradialytic weight gains requiring ever higher ultrafi ltration volumes and more frequent IDH. 304 CHAPTER 4 Dialysis Extended hours hemodialysis treatments Background Dialysis frequency and duration - For 3 decades in Tassin, France, patients with end-stage renal disease have received 8h in-centre Dialysis sessions 3x/wk. Patient outcome data with this regime are amongst the best in the world. - This improved survival (compared to shorter Dialysis schedules) is mainly due to lower CV mortality. Other reported benefi ts include improved nutritional status, better anaemia parameters (with lower erythropoiesis-stimulating agent requirement) and superior blood pressure control. - In addition, the 2-day interval between conventional hemodialysis sessions is well recognised as a time of heightened risk for CV events. - In view of these observations, it has been proposed that modern Dialysis care should focus on: - - i Dialysis frequency - i Dialysis duration - Or both of these. - Strategies to increase the intensity of Dialysis include short daily haemodialysis (SDHD), in-hospital nocturnal haemodialysis (INHD) and nocturnal home haemodialysis (NHHD).",

Frequent Haemodialysis Network (FHN) - The FHN, formed in 2005, is responsible for the two most recent RCTs that have examined daily and nocturnal Dialysis. - The trials (short daily haemodialysis (SDHD) v conventional hemodialysis (2010) and nocturnal haemodialysis (NHD) v conventional hemodialysis (2011)), were designed to test the hypothesis that signifi cant modifi cations to hemodialysis treatment time and/or frequency would have a signifi cant impact on patient outcomes. - Outcome measures included mortality, change in LV mass, and change in self-reported physical functioning. - Unfortunately neither of the studies was powered suffi ciently to examine the effects of either mortality or risk of hospitalisation. However, they did demonstrate that frequent or long duration Dialysis schedules could improve certain clinical parameters and quality of life scores. - Benefi ts of increased hours dialysing may, however, be at the expense of vascular access longevity in some patients. EXTENDED HOURS hemodialysis TREATMENTS 305 Survival Studies - RCT design, particularly when studying a therapeutic intervention such as hemodialysis, can be challenging - as has proved to be the case for the FHN. - Recruitment of signifi cant numbers of Dialysis patients to RCTs is often diffi cult. It took 10 years and millions of dollars to recruit 245 patients to the SDHD v conventional hemodialysis FHN study (2010). - However, there are large cohorts of patients undergoing various Dialysis schedules and these can provide highly informative data. Table 4. 2 summarizes some of the recent survival studies (USA and Canada based) with respect to different extended hours modalities. Home haemodialysis - Extended hours treatments are associated with certain barriers (both perceived and actual) for patients and these should be balanced against potential benefi ts. Some barriers may be overcome through the greater fl exibility of a home-based therapy. - Improving the patients understanding of the benefi ts of intensive treatment is fundamental to successful implementation. - Meticulous attention to care of vascular access is essential for longevity and reduced infection/hospitalization. 306 CHAPTER 4 Dialysis. stnemtaert sisylaid sruoh evisnetni gnivlovni seidutS lavivruS 2. 4 elbaT semoctuO wolloF naideM ngised ydutS rotarapmoC rohtuA ytiladoM )sraey( pu srebmuN raey neewteb lavivrus detsujda eht ni ecnereffid oN 8. 3: DHN dehctaM tnalpsnarT v DHN, la te yluaP sisylaiD lanrutcoN; 15. 105. 0 lC %59, 78. 0 RH( XTD dna DHN 6. 4: XTD evitcepsorter 771: DHN 9002 saw lavivrus XTL; )puorg ecnerefer DHN 3. 4: XTL trohoc 335: XTL, 335: XTD. )19. 082. 0lC %59, 15. 0RH( retteb derapmoc deid stneitap detaert DHN fo %31 8. 1: DHN dehctaM DHC v DHN hallarseN sisylaiD lanrutcoN gnirud, stneitap detaert DHC fo %12 htiw 8. 1: DHC evitcepsorter 833: DHN 2102, la te 5. 01 susrev 1. 6(; pu wollof raey 8. 1 eht trohoc 8831: DHC %59; 55. 0RH; sraey-snosrep 001 rep shtaed. )78. 043. 0lC detaert DHNI rof %18 saw lavivrus raey-2 9. 2: DHNI dehctaM DHC v DHNI, la te noscaL )ertnec-nI( DHC rof %37 htiw derapmoc stneitap 3. 3: DHC taert-ot-noitnetni 647: DHNI 2102 sisylaiD lanrutcoN. stneitap evitcepsorter 2602: DHC rof ksir eht ni noitcuder %52 a dah DHNI trohoc dna, MB, ega rof tnemtsujda retfa htaed )19. 016. 0lC %59, 57. 0RH( egatniv sisylaid %2.",

Massage the affected area. Regular quinine sulfate can be helpful for some. Carnitine defi ciency is present in some intractable cases and supplementation can be given (usually IV post Dialysis). Nausea and Vomiting - Often associated with dBP. - Management: administer an anti-emetic. Observe patient through treatment and reassess at completion. Headache - May be s to dBP, iBP, disequilibrium syndrome or large fl uid shifts during Dialysis. - Management: analgesia. Reassure. Review ultrafi ltration volumes. Investigate if persistent. Fever - Often s to Dialysis access infection, particularly CVCs (b XXX). - Patient often rigors prior to temperature rise. - Management: 2 the patient requires a detailed clinical review. Reassure, paracetamol, Blood cultures, antibiotics according to local policy. Haemolysis - Rare, but potentially serious. - Causes: overheating of dialysate, dialysate contamination, impure Water supply, and Dialysis machine malfunction. Multiple patients may be affected. Anaemia and iK (1 can be severe) may result. Clotting of extracorporeal circuit (Blood lines and dialyser) - Causes: inadequate anticoagulation, Low Blood fl ow rates, iHb levels (High viscosity), intradialytic Blood transfusion, or clotted access. - Warning signs: High (or increasing) venous Hypertension, the Blood circuit darkens, i TMP. - Action: disconnect the patient from the Dialysis circuit and fl ush their Dialysis access with saline. Discard the old circuit and prime a new one. Recommence Dialysis. Check FBC. - Next session: titrate anticoagulation carefully. If anticoagulation is contraindicated, fl ush the Dialysis circuit at hourly intervals with 50-100mL of 0. 9% Sodium chloride (as permitted by the patients volume status).

Cardiac arrest in the Dialysis unit - Manage as for any non-Dialysis cardiac arrest. - Consider iK and other electrolyte imbalances early. - Ask Dialysis staff to wash back and discontinue Dialysis. - Consider the impact of witnessing an arrest on nearby patients. Disequilibrium (see also b p. 177) - Cause: High Blood urea levels being reduced too rapidly. Usually occurs during fi rst Dialysis session (with High Blood fl ows). - Prevention: use a dialyser with small surface area, commence Blood fl ow rate at 150-200mL/min. Limit fi rst session to 2h. - Clinical features: nausea and Vomiting, agitation, headache, seizures, loss of consciousness.",

OTHER hemodialysis COMPLICATIONS 311 Long-term hemodialysis complications Cardiovascular Disease - Dialysis patients are 720x more likely to die a CV death than the general population. A cardiac cause is implicated in 40% of all deaths at end-stage renal disease. - The cause in Dialysis patients is multifactorial and not limited to classical Framingham risk factors (b p. 198). Vascular Calcifi cation (b p. 242) Malnutrition (b p. 260) - Causes: inadequate Dialysis dose (lkanorexia, altered taste and reduced enjoyment of food), infl ammation, dietary restrictions, nutrients lost via dialysate (4-8g amino acids lost per session), relative catabolic state, medications (e. g. unpalatable PO binders), 4 impaired absorption of nutrients, gastroparesis. - Management: early dietetic support, nutritional supplements, parenteral nutrition (intradialytic parenteral nutrition (IDPN) is available, is convenient and does not require additional IV access but it may not provide suffi cient Protein and calories to meet the needs of the patient), reduce infl ammation (l treat infection, use biocompatible hemodialysis membranes, review Water endotoxin levels), Aluminium toxicity (b p. 247) Dialysis related amyloidosis (DRA) (b p. 632). Withdrawal of hemodialysis (see also b p 270) This is the second most common cause of death in RRT (15%). Several factors may contribute to a patient and/or their physician considering withdrawal, including advancing age, frailty, presence of multiple deteriorating co-morbidities, malignancy, chronic Pain, reduced mobility, dementia, diffi culties with vascular access, repeated hospital admissions, problems during Dialysis itself (e. g. recurrent hypotension) and poor overall quality of life. If considering withdrawal it is important to consider the following: - Reversible factors (including depression). - Assessment of patients decision-making capacity. - Identifi cation of any advanced directives. - Full family or care involvement. - Involvement of the patients general practitioner and local palliative services. - 2 Post withdrawal supportive care Post withdrawal, patients typically survive 1-2 weeks, depending on residual renal function. Palliative support (at home, if possible, depending on the patients wishes) should include: relaxation of dietary restrictions, continued fl uid restriction to avoid distressing pulmonary oedema, appropriate analgesia (see p. 271), management of anxiety and dyspnoea (b p. 268). Advanced directives should be encouraged in Dialysis patients. 312 CHAPTER 4 Dialysis Peritoneal Dialysis (peritoneal dialysis) Introduction peritoneal dialysis is the Dialysis modality of 11% of patients worldwide ( 7 250, 000 patients). The proportion varies dramatically, however, with 5% in Japan and 60% in Mexico. It is generally accepted that patient survival on peritoneal dialysis is similar, compared to hemodialysis; in fact, these modalities should be seen as complementary, offering different benefi ts for individuals at different times in their Dialysis history the so-called integrated Dialysis care approach. Advantages of peritoneal dialysis Preservation of residual renal function. No need for vascular access. Mobility (e. g. easy to transport Dialysis to holiday destinations). Patient engagement in treatment. Home-based therapy maintains patient independence. Less expensive than hemodialysis. Less risk of transmission of Blood-borne viruses. Physiology and concepts The semi-permeable Dialysis membrane of the peritoneum comprises the capillary endothelium, supporting matrix, and peritoneal mesothelium. Fluid and solutes move between the fl uid-fi lled peritoneum and Blood via, what is termed, the three-pore model of peritoneal dialysis. Large pores (20 40nm): allow macromolecules, such as proteins, to be fi ltered between compartments (effectively via venular or lymphatic absorption). Small pores (4 6nm): responsible for the transport of small solutes, such as Sodium, Potassium, urea, and Creatinine. Ultrasmall pores (0. 8nm): transport Water alone (shown to be aquaporin 1).",

It is possible that the small and large pores represent different functional states of a single entity, depending on the density of the glycocalyx. The net movement of solutes, such as urea, will depend on: Net diffusion through small pores and convection through large pores. Total volume of dialysate infused. Net fl uid ultrafi ltration (or, under certain circumstances, absorption). Effective peritoneal surface area Peritoneal capillary endothelium is the predominant barrier to peritoneal solute transport. However, at any one time, not all capillaries are equally perfused, and not all are close enough to the mesothelium (and thus dialysate) for effective Dialysis. The effective peritoneal surface area then varies (e. g. with peritonitis or changing dialysate volumes). Increasing the effective peritoneal surface area allows faster rates of small solute transfer but not necessarily better overall Dialysis by increasing dissipation of glucose, ultrafi ltration might actually decrease ( b p. 318). PERITONEAL Dialysis (peritoneal dialysis) 313 Ultrafi ltration (ultrafiltration) The net movement of Water (ultrafiltration) relies on the presence of a High intraperitoneal osmotic gradient (generated by glucose) or oncotic gradient (generated by glucose polymers, such as icodextrin). Any absorption of dialysate via the lymphatics (esp. if i intraperitoneal hydrostatic pressure from patient posture or High instilled peritoneal dialysis volumes) will oppose this fl uid movement into the peritoneum. The osmotic gradient is usually generated by glucose and depends on: The glucose concentration of the dialysate. A patient s Blood glucose. The rate of absorption of glucose itself from peritoneal dialysis fl uid. ultrafiltration is optimized by: Ensuring normoglycaemia (relevant for diabetic patients). Adjusting the tonicity of the peritoneal dialysis solution (glucose concentration). Altering the duration of each Dialysis dwell. Adjusting dwell volumes; i volume often (but not always) leads to i ultrafiltration (see next paragraphs). As an alternative to glucose-based solutions, glucose polymers (such as icodextrin) are poorly absorbed and slowly metabolized t hese peritoneal dialysis solutions provide a sustained oncotic gradient over longer dwells and permit i ultrafiltration, particularly for patients designated as High transporters ( b p. 316). i dwell volumes of dialysate may maintain the glucose gradient for longer, but i intraperitoneal Hypertension may i lymphatic return. Also, i volume might increase effective peritoneal surface area, with more rapid absorption of glucose, lessening the glucose gradient and reducing ultrafiltration. Contraindications to peritoneal dialysis Absolute Patient or carer unable to train adequately in the technique. Inguinal, umbilical, or diaphragmatic hernias (esp. pleuroperitoneal leak). Ileostomy or colostomy. Abdominal wall infections or intra-abdominal sepsis, e. g. active diverticular disease. Relative Abdominal surgeries (adhesions). The more extensive the surgery, the more likely peritoneal dialysis will be unsuccessful. Morbid obesity (inadequate clearance). Huge polycystic kidneys (insuffi cient intraperitoneal space).

Severe lung disease (diaphragmatic splinting). 314 CHAPTER 4 Dialysis Types of peritoneal dialysis Introduction Intermittent peritoneal dialysis was originally developed for the treatment of acute kidney injury in situations where hemodialysis facilities are not available ( b p. 188). Rapid exchanges over a 24-hour period are repeated twice or more times a week. The peritoneal catheters used for treatment of acute kidney injury are often different from those used for patients with end-stage renal disease (although standard cuffed tubes can be used). See Fig. 4. 8 for types of peritoneal dialysis. peritoneal dialysis regimens for end-stage renal disease Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) Consists of 3 5 exchanges, with dwell times of 4 10 hours over 24 hours.

Advantages of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis include simplicity, ease of training, and fl exibility t he timing of exchanges can be adjusted to times of convenience for patients (although dwells 3 hours are generally discouraged). Automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) Uses an automated machine to perform exchanges at night whilst the patient is asleep. The machine is usually programmed to perform at least four exchanges over 8 hours (can be more, depending on individual tolerance). At the end of the overnight exchanges, the machine can be programmed to leave the patient dry for the daytime (sometimes termed night-time intermittent peritoneal Dialysis, NIPD). Alternatively, the machine can perform a last fi ll, leaving peritoneal dialysis fl uid in the peritoneum. Patients may then perform a further exchange during the day (either manually or using the APD machine (sometimes termed continuous cycling peritoneal Dialysis or continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis). Tidal APD Has the machine programmed to only partially drain out peritoneal dialysis fl uid at the end of any dwell during the nightly cycles ( 75% tidal indicates that the machine will stop draining fl uid out when 75% of the expected drain has been extracted). Although effi ciency of Dialysis is reduced, it is useful for patients whose sleep is disturbed through the discomfort experienced when dry or near dry. Assisted APD Poor strength, limited dexterity, decreased vision, or cognitive impairment may mean that some patients are unable to perform peritoneal dialysis themselves, although they may potentially benefi t from a home-based therapy.

The connectology has been refi ned over the years to minimize peritonitis risk through touch contamination. At the time of an exchange, the patient connects a Y-shaped set with a sterile drain bag and a fresh dialysate bag. Patients are taught to make this connection using a sterile technique, although various assist devices are available to aid patients with dexterity or visual problems (e. g. UV Flash Compact ). After the waste dialysate is drained into the empty bag, the Y-connector is fl ushed (theoretically, fl ushing away any contaminating bacteria in this portion of the giving set), using a small volume of fresh dialysate.

Buffer: bicarbonate is not compatible for storage with calcium and magnesium in peritoneal dialysis bags, so lactate (which is rapidly converted to bicarbonate in the Liver) is widely used instead, at 35 40mmol/L.

Icodextrin (for an oncotic gradient), rather than glucose (as an osmotic gradient), to achieve ultrafiltration. Amino acids as nutritional supplement. (cid: 2) May cause systemic acidosis. Biocompatible solutions peritoneal dialysis fl uid is sterilized through heat treatment. During this process, at the pH of lactate-based glucose solutions, glucose degradation products (GDP) and advanced glycation end-products (AGE) are formed. These are believed to damage the peritoneal membrane: AGE exposure correlates with fi brotic change. Thus, more biocompatible solutions have been developed in an attempt to ameliorate this. One such solution depends on a twin-bag system; heat sterilization of the compartment containing glucose (at very Low pH) generates very Low levels of GDP and AGE. The second compartment contains the acid buffer, e. g. predominantly bicarbonate in the case of Physioneal or lactate in the case of Balance . Retrospective analysis of registry data suggested patient survival was better in the group treated with biocompatible solutions, while prospective trials have shown that biocompatible fl uids may preserve native Urine output volumes (although not solute clearance) as well as reduce rates of peritonitis. However, defi nitive evidence to support their use (and increased cost) is lacking. Solutions that rely on molecules, other than glucose, to provide the osmotic gradient have no GDP or AGE.

Dialysis adequacy (b p. 328) and ultrafiltration failure ( b p. 332) are discussed separately. The choice of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or APD will depend on patient choice, lifestyle, and peritoneal transport status. High transporters allow rapid movement of urea and other small The concept of transporter status High concentrations of glucose generate an osmotic gradient across the peritoneal membrane. During the Dialysis dwell, glucose is gradually absorbed, leading to a fall in glucose concentration and dialysate osmolality within the peritoneal cavity. The rate of glucose dissipation correlates with the rate at which creatinine equilibrates across the peritoneal membrane and can change over time (termed the transport status of the patient). This can be measured during a peritoneal equilibration test (PET, b p. 330). molecules across the peritoneal membrane (through small pores, b p. 330). However, they also absorb glucose rapidly, dissipating the osmotic gradient so that net ultrafiltration at the end of a dwell is likely to be Low.",

    "text": "This means that a High transporter often has diffi culty achieving adequate small solute clearance. High transporters are particularly suitable for APD, as frequent short dwells maximize ultrafiltration and total solute removal. Low transporters benefi t less from very short dwells on APD. Introducing a fi fth peritoneal dialysis exchange may be preferable (either manually or using an automated machine to deliver an additional exchange at night, b p. 314). Most patients start continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis on four light (1. 36 1. 5% dextrose) peritoneal dialysis bags. If this fails to provide adequate ultrafiltration, one exchange is changed to a higher glucose concentration bag or icodextrin containing Extraneal . Further increases in glucose concentration may be necessary to achieve adequate Dialysis and ultrafiltration (but see b p. 319). With long-term peritoneal dialysis, changes in the peritoneal membrane create a tendency for Low transporters to evolve into High transporters. Following characterization of a patient s membrane transport characteristics (via a PET, b p. 330), computer software can be used to predict small solute clearance and ultrafiltration. These can be particularly useful when considering the necessary changes to a peritoneal dialysis prescription in response to a reduction in ultrafiltration or solute clearance. PRESCRIBING peritoneal dialysis 319 (cid: 2) Increasing the volume of a peritoneal dialysis exchange can increase solute clearance, but the consequent rise in intraperitoneal Hypertension may adversely affect ultrafiltration. Avoiding peritoneal glucose exposure High peritoneal glucose exposure over time (often years) predicts the development of ultrafiltration failure, and causality has been suggested. An alternative to glucose-containing Dialysis solutions dialysate is icodextrin (Extraneal ). Icodextrin is a 20-glucose polymer with potent colloidal effects (similar to albumin). Icodextrin is particularly suited to High transporters. It acts at the small intercellular pores and is only slowly lost from the peritoneal cavity, meaning that the oncotic gradient is maintained. It 6 produces gradual and sustained ultrafiltration over long dwell periods (overnight dwell in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or daytime dwell in APD). (cid: 2) Ensure diabetics have glucose-specifi c monitors, as icodextrin may cross-react with some glucometers, showing falsely High readings (i. e. there is a risk of undetected hypoglycaemia). 320 CHAPTER 4 Dialysis Peritonitis Introduction Peritonitis is the major complication of peritoneal dialysis, leading to signifi cant morbidity and mortality. Repeated episodes of peritonitis will also accelerate peritoneal membrane failure, often necessitating a transfer of modality to haemodialysis. The incidence of peritonitis has declined from about 3 episodes/patient/year in the 1980s to 0. 6 0. 7 episodes/patient/year (or 7 1 episode every 18 months), attributed to improved patient education and better catheter technology. The disconnect fl ush-before-fi ll system has also been an important advance. In addition, standard care for all peritoneal dialysis exit sites usually includes chlorhexidine-containing disinfectant wiping of plastic and daily application of a topical antibiotic ointment (such as mupirocin). Risk factors type 2 diabetes mellitus, other signifi cant comorbibity. Catheter type and implantation technique. Connection systems. Nasal carriage of S taphylococcus aureus.

Mupirocin ointment administered to the catheter exit site can prevent exit site infection and, potentially, S. aureus peritonitis. 3 Every episode of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis should prompt a root cause analysis and review of aseptic technique. PERITONITIS: MANAGEMENT 323 Special considerations for APD Even in the absence of peritonitis, long day dwells may be misty . However, because cycling times are shorter, cloudy overnight dialysate may not occur, even in the presence of peritonitis. Moreover, in some cases, peritoneal dialysis effl uent is drained directly into a sink. This means it is very important for APD patients to recognize potential symptoms of peritonitis and to perform a dwell of at least 2 hours (for visual inspection and sampling of fl uid for M, CS). Treatment also requires some modifi cations to normal APD technique. One option is to convert patients to continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for the duration of the episode. More preferable is to give antibiotics into the last dwell on the machine (sometimes called the fi rst ambulatory dwell). Indications for peritoneal dialysis catheter removal during infection 2 Refractory peritonitis (cloudy bags persists after 5 days of appropriate antibiotic therapy). Relapsing peritonitis ( b p. 321). Fungal peritonitis. Persistent exit site or tunnel infection. Potential: Multiple episodes of peritonitis in an individual patient. Mycobacterial peritonitis. Peritonitis caused by multiple organisms of likely enteric origin. 324 CHAPTER 4 Dialysis Other peritoneal dialysis complications Catheter exit site infection A purulent 9 bloody discharge from a peritoneal dialysis catheter exit site, often associated with erythema and Pain. Crusting alone is not indicative of an acute exit site infection. Scoring systems have been developed, including this one recommended by the ISPD (see Table 4. 4).

Diagnosis of tunnel infection is usually obvious clinically but can be confi rmed by ultrasound examination. Treatment usually involves removing the catheter, as peritonitis is a common complication. OTHER peritoneal dialysis COMPLICATIONS 325 Drainage problems This needs to be differentiated from the more serious ultrafiltration failure. Catheter fl ow problems can present with either slow drainage (drainage takes 15 20 minutes under gravity) or incomplete drainage (High residual volume measured on PET or drain volume is less than the infused volume of a rapid exchange). Causes include: Constipation. Catheter malposition (usually migration out of the pelvis). Catheter occlusions (kinking, thrombus, fi brin, and omental wrapping). Fluid leaks into subcutaneous tissue via hernias or at the catheter insertion site. Infl ow problems can also occur for similar reasons and also if the catheter tip is trapped in an area of intra-abdominal adhesions. Clinical assessment will usually determine the majority of causes. If necessary, plain kidney, ureter, bladder can be performed to exclude catheter malposition and constipation. The majority of drainage problems can be improved without surgical intervention: Laxatives (most peritoneal dialysis patients require regular laxatives, e. g. senna and lactulose, but a short course of a stronger aperient, such as Sodium picosulfate, may be required). Intracatheter heparin locks (e. g. 500 units as a lock or 500 units/L in exchanges), particularly if visible fi brin in catheter or drainage fl uid. Thrombolytics, such as urokinase, may be instilled in the catheter lumen. Endoluminal brushing ( (cid: 2) infection! ). If surgical repositioning of the peritoneal dialysis catheter is required, a concomitant adhesiolysis and omentectomy should be considered. Peritoneal leaks Dialysate may leak down the catheter tunnel and spread into the subcutaneous tissues (or leak around the exit site). A patent processus vaginalis may allow peritoneal dialysis fl uid to track into the scrotum, mimicking a hernia or hydrocele. Small diaphragmatic hernias may permit peritoneal dialysis fl uid to enter the pleural space (usually on the right side). Clinically, local oedema 9 peau d orange skin appearance may signify a subcutaneous leak. Pleural taps or aspirates from hydroceles can be tested for glucose concentration to confi rm it is Dialysis fl uid. If in doubt, perform computed tomography peritoneogram, e. g. infuse 100mL of non-ionic contrast into a 2L peritoneal dialysis bag, and drain in 1L. Perform computed tomography 1 2 hours thereafter. Leaks around the catheter often heal with temporary (2 4 weeks) discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis (temporary hemodialysis will usually be required). peritoneal dialysis can be restarted, using smaller exchange volumes to reduce intra-abdominal Hypertension. If leaks recur, the peritoneal dialysis catheter can be repositioned with a new insertion site. Hernias should be repaired in a standard manner.",

APD with a dry day (NIPD) can be particularly successful to minimize recurrence. 326 CHAPTER 4 Dialysis Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP) SEP is a feared complication of long-term peritoneal dialysis therapy, with a poor prognosis. It is extremely rare before 3 years and has an incidence around 5% at 5 years. The peritoneal cavity becomes encased in fi brous tissue, with bowel wall thickening and peritoneal calcifi cation. It is thought to be multifactorial in origin, with prior severe/recurrent peritonitis, foreign body reactions to plasticizers on catheters, and long-term peritoneal dialysis exposure to High concentration glucose-containing solutions all suggested to be pathogenic. Clinically Symptoms of intermittent bowel obstruction (abdominal Pain, nausea, Vomiting). Poor ultrafiltration or ultrafiltration failure ( b p. 332). Malnutrition is frequent and may be severe. Symptoms may occur after peritonitis and often after stopping peritoneal dialysis (e. g. post-transplantation). Investigation computed tomography abdomen is the investigation of choice, demonstrating peritoneal thickening and calcifi cation with entrapped bowel loops. Laparoscopy and peritoneal biopsy is diagnostic. Management Evidence is limited: Stop peritoneal dialysis (symptoms may paradoxically worsen). Early specialist dietetic input. Nasogastric feeding or TPN may be required. X Drug therapy: immunosuppression (steroids, CNIs, azathioprine) and tamoxifen (antifi brotic) have all been tried, but evidence of effi cacy is anecdotal at best. Surgery (enterolysis) is an option but only in specialist centres. Renal transplantation some reported cases of improvement. Prevention There are no effective screening tests, and onset may be rapid. Currently, there is no optimal duration of peritoneal dialysis therapy, and decisions should be tailored to the individual. Switching to hemodialysis may be advisable, based upon episodes of peritonitis and/or deteriorating membrane function/ultrafiltration failure. OTHER peritoneal dialysis COMPLICATIONS 327 328 CHAPTER 4 Dialysis peritoneal dialysis adequacy Introduction Although the term Dialysis adequacy is often restricted to the formal calculation of delivered Dialysis dose in terms of weekly clearance of urea (dialysis adequacy measure) and Creatinine (creatinine clearance) ( b p. 286), the measurement of Dialysis adequacy should mandate a more global assessment of health, including: Absence of uraemic symptoms. Nutritional status, appetite, weight, serum albumin. Fluid status. Quality of life (e. g. by subjective global assessment scoring). Improved biochemistry and correction of the complications of uraemia, such as anaemia. Delivered Dialysis dose can be formally measured by calculating weekly clearance for urea (dialysis adequacy measure) and Creatinine (creatinine clearance) (b p. 286). The utility of dialysis adequacy measure, a kinetic measure derived from hemodialysis practice, remains contentious in peritoneal dialysis. Commercially available computer programmes will helpfully calculate urea and Creatinine clearances, based on dialysate and plasma urea and Creatinine values obtained during a PET (b p. 330) or other standardized regimen. The current ultrasound and UK peritoneal dialysis adequacy targets are very similar: ultrasound Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative: Measure after 1 month, then 4-monthly. If residual Urine output 100mL/day: combined Urine and peritoneal weekly dialysis adequacy measure should be 1. 7. If residual Urine output 100mL/day: peritoneal weekly dialysis adequacy measure should be 1. 7. UK Renal Association: Measure 6-monthly (or more frequently, if indicated). Combined urinary and peritoneal dialysis adequacy measure ≥ 1. 7/week or creatinine clearance ≥ 50L/ week/1. 73m2. X Although there is no evidence that increasing the dose above these targets improve survival, it is generally accepted that they should be viewed as minimum treatment standards and that the Dialysis dose should be increased as clinical circumstances dictate. 2 The most powerful predictor of patient survival on peritoneal dialysis is not Dialysis adequacy, but the presence of residual renal function.",

Consider converting to APD to allow rapid cycling overnight. Increasing dwell volumes is unlikely to help, as it will slow down exchanges and may reduce ultrafiltration. If Low or Low average transporter: More time is required, as solute clearance is slower. Increasing dwell volumes and dwell times may help. Consider an overnight dwell. APD Optimize cycle duration in accordance to patient transport status, as described in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis section (short cycles for High transporter). This might necessitate increasing total duration of APD. Consider the use of additional daytime exchanges. 330 CHAPTER 4 Dialysis The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) The test The evening prior to PET, the patient performs a standard continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis exchange. The exchange should dwell for 8 12h. Drain overnight dwell over 20min, and note volume. Prepare a 2L 2. 27%/2. 5% dialysate solution bag at body temperature, and infuse over 10min, with the patient in a supine position. After 10min, dialysate samples are collected as follows: drain 200mL dialysate back into the fi ll bag, and mix sample by inverting bag 2 3 times. Using aseptic technique, withdraw 10mL dialysate sample, and send for determination of Creatinine and glucose. Repeat at 2h. At 4h, completely drain the exchange over 20min. Weigh drain bag, and record volume drained. Invert bag 2 3 times; send samples for Creatinine and glucose. PET calculations: D /P dialysate concentration of Creatinine at 0, 2, and 4h, creatinine creatinine divided by serum concentration of corrected Creatinine. D/D dialysate glucose concentration at 2h and 4h, divided by 0 dialysate glucose concentration at 0h. Residual renal function is estimated on 24h Urine collection. Interpretation If protocols are strictly followed, this is a highly reproducible assessment of peritoneal membrane transport function. The ratio of dialysate and plasma Creatinine concentrations (D /P creatinine creatinine ratio) after a 4h dwell is a measure of solute equilibration. High transporters are defi ned by a D /P 0. 8 and Low creatinine creatinine transporters 0. 5. In between these are High average (0. 65 0. 8) and Low average (0. 5 0. 64). Since glucose absorbed from the dialysate is very quickly metabolized, D/P ratio for glucose is meaningless. Instead, the fraction of glucose absorbed from the dialysate at 4h is compared with the initial Dialysis solution (D/D ). This is also a useful indicator of transport status. 0 A PET is also a useful objective assessment of ultrafi ltration. However, a ultrafiltration volume 400mL after modifi ed PET, utilizing a 3. 86% glucose dwell, is more specifi c for ultrafiltration failure ( b p. 332). peritoneal dialysis ADEQUACY 331 332 CHAPTER 4 Dialysis Ultrafi ltration (ultrafiltration) failure peritoneal dialysis patients with fl uid overload are either struggling to be compliant with a realistic fl uid restriction or have inadequate ultrafiltration.

Residual Urine output (which may be stimulated with diuretics) is also very important. As a general rule, a patient should be able to ultrafiltration ≥ 1L/day. If they are anuric, (defi ned as UO 100mL/day), then minimum daily ultrafiltration should be 750mL. Approach (See Fig. 4. 10) Consider modifi ed PET (sometimes called standardized permeability analysis) to differentiate ultrafiltration failure from other cases of fl uid overload. 2 Net ultrafiltration 400mL at 4h with 3. 86% glucose defi nes ultrafiltration failure. Determining transporter status can also help diagnose the cause of ultrafiltration failure; in particular, is the patient a High transporter (b p. 318)? Evaluate the residual peritoneal volume during PET: a normal residual volume is up to 200 250mL. Higher volumes might suggest catheter-related drainage problems, rather than ultrafiltration failure (i. e. the patient may be removing fl uid through ultrafiltration, but it does not drain out adequately from their peritoneal cavity). Also check drain time during the PET. Exclude mechanical catheter or APD equipment problems ( b p. 325). Avoid long dwells (4h) with Low glucose concentrations. Use icodextrin, instead of glucose, for the longest dwell. If on APD, consider additional short day exchange. Causes High transporter status (often seen in long-standing peritoneal dialysis patients). If not High transporter, consider: Leaks ( b p. 325). Reduced effective peritoneal surface area from peritoneal adhesions. Increased lymphatic absorption. Aquaporin defi ciency or failure (indicated by loss of Sodium sieving during modifi ed PET/standardized permeability analysis). Patients with ultrafi ltration failure will usually need to be switched to hemodialysis permanently. However, peritoneal membrane function can sometimes be improved by resting peritoneal dialysis (for 4 12 weeks) and might be considered where quality of life on long-term hemodialysis will be poor (e. g. excessive travel times).

LA Low average. HA High average. 334 CHAPTER 4 Dialysis The well peritoneal dialysis patient Introduction Adequate Dialysis: maintain residual renal and peritoneal membrane function. Dialysis adequacy should be measured in terms of clearance of small solute clearance (including dialysis adequacy measure and creatinine clearance) and nutritional parameters. Aim for normotension by Good salt and Water removal generally, achieving minimum daily fl uid removal of 750mL. Preserving residual renal function (basically, UO) makes these goals easier to achieve and may improve outcomes (making an argument for use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for ongoing renoprotection and avoiding nephrotoxins in peritoneal dialysis patients; 2 residual Urine matters). Changes in patients transport status over time (b p. 318) may make the maintenance of satisfactory ultrafiltration and small solute clearance diffi cult without imposing onerous Dialysis regimens and unrealistic fl uid restrictions on them. High intraperitoneal glucose concentrations, with consequent exposure to GDP or AGE, is suggested to accelerate peritoneal membrane changes, so the use of Low GDP solutions, such as twin-bag physiological solutions, icodextrin, or amino acid solutions, m ay be desirable (X ).

However, for some, the risks of transplantation (the surgery itself plus subsequent immune suppression) will outweigh potential benefi ts. Suitability for transplantation has no set criteria but should refl ect the recipients physical status ( fi tness ), likely quality of life post-transplantation, and, wherever possible, the patients wishes (which assumes adequate education). Benefi ts of transplantation Improved patient survival: It is not fair to make a straight comparison between the survival of Dialysis patients and the survival of transplanted patients, as many Dialysis patients are elderly 9 have comorbidities that preclude transplantation. However, if the playing fi eld is levelled and patients survival post-transplant is compared to a matched transplant-listed Dialysis cohort, there remains a signifi cant survival advantage, once the initial risk of surgery is overcome (Fig. 5. 1). Much of this improvement appears to stem from a reduction in CV mortality. Improved quality of life: Freedom from the constraints of Dialysis treatment, including the time commitment and both dietary and fl uid restrictions. Improved overall sense of well-being. Improved exercise capacity. Improved quality of life for close family. More complete and physiological correction of the uraemic milieu, including complications, such as anaemia and chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder. Improved sexual function and fertility, including the potential for successful pregnancy in ( b p. 864). Better for the health economics: transplantation is less expensive than Dialysis (after the fi rst year). X The risk-benefi t ratio of renal transplantation is changing, although much of the currently available data may not adequately refl ect this. There is a signifi cant difference between transplanting a 70-year-old Dialysis patient from a live donor and with an organ from a marginal deceased donor, particularly if the recipient is thriving on a state-ofthe-art daily home Dialysis therapy. Preliminary outcome data suggest satisfactory, albeit less Good, early outcomes, but patients must be very carefully selected, given appropriate (and realistic) information and education and longer-term outcomes, including quality of life, need further evaluation.

TRANSPLANTATION: BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES 339 This disparity has encouraged the use of organs from more marginal donors, e. g. donation after cardiac death (donation after circulatory death) and elderly donors with acknowledged comorbidity ( b pp. 3668). (See Fig. 5. 5) Other efforts to expand the donor pool include the growth of live donor programmes (including altruistic donation), dual transplants ( b p. 401), ABOand HLA-incompatible grafts, and paired schemes ( b pp. 4445). The chronic kidney disease population is ageing. The median age of prevalent Dialysis patients in the UK is 7 65. This more elderly population is also more comorbid, making selection for successful transplantation (and appropriate matching of organs) more challenging. The ultimate goal is to prolong both patient and graft survival post-transplantation. This requires: More effective and less toxic immune suppression. d morbidity and mortality from infection, malignancy, and CV disease ( 2 better transplant function l lower CV mortality).

The most important of these are: ultrasound Renal Database System (USRDS). The Collaborative Transplant Study (CTS). United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS). The Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA). UK National Transplant Database (maintained by NHS Blood and Transplant). Box 5. 1 Key facts The 1-year survival for deceased donor renal transplants is 7 91%. Patient survival is 95%. The 1-year survival for live donor renal transplants is 7 97%. Patient survival is 98%. This has steadily improved over the last two decades. The 5-year survival for deceased donor renal transplants is 7 70%. Patient survival is 7 80%. The 5-year survival for live donor renal transplants is 7 82%. Patient survival is 7 90%. The 10-year survival for deceased donor renal transplants is 7 45%. Patient survival is 7 60%.

DGF is associated with d graft survival, i mortality, i rejection ( l probably enhanced graft immunogenicity post-reperfusion). HLA matching: For deceased donor kidneys, better HLA matching is associated with improved graft survival. This falls progressively with increasing mismatch (see Fig. 5. 8). The effect is much less pronounced for live donor kidneys, whether related or unrelated. Timing of transplantation: Pre-emptive transplantation provides a survival benefi t for both graft and recipient. Graft survival deteriorates, with longer times on Dialysis pre-transplantation. Reasons: more recipient CV disease, higher incidence of DGF, socio-economic factors. In the UK, 7 35% of adult live donor and just 7 10% of deceased donor transplants are pre-emptive. 100 80 60 40 20 )gol( lavivrus tfarg % 0 MM 1 MM 2 MM 3 MM 4 MM 20-year Half-life 6 MM estimate (years) 5 MM 0 MM 43 % 17. 4 1 MM 37 % 15. 4 2 MM 36 % 14. 6 3 MM 35 % 14. 2 4 MM 33 % 13. 8 5 MM 28 % 12. 0 6 MM 28 % 12.",

TRANSPLANTATION OUTCOMES 343 Donor factors: Age: 5-year survival of a deceased donor Kidney from a donor age 18 34 is 7 80%, compared to 7 55% for donor age 65. (cid: 2) This is a very important issue, as the average donor age is progressively increasing. Living donor grafts last longer than deceased donor grafts (less cold ischaemia, better health of donor, often less time on Dialysis accruing CV disease and other complications, higher nephron mass, better recipient compliance). See Box 5. 1 on b p. 340. Donation after brain death (donation after brain death) kidneys have better outcomes than those donated after cardiac death (donation after circulatory death) ( b pp. 3658). ECD kidneys have poorer, if acceptable, outcomes overall (although this can be diffi cult to predict at the time of transplantation). i cold ischaemic time (CIT) li DGF ld graft survival. This risk is particularly High when CIT 18h. The time it will take to transport a Kidney is usually taken into account in organ allocation schemes ( b p. 365). Recipient factors: Age. The commonest cause of graft loss beyond age 65 is death with a functioning transplant. Race. In the USA, black recipients of deceased donor transplants have poorer outcomes than Caucasian recipients. This is partly due to i DGF in black recipients as well as inferior HLA matching (the donor pool is predominantly Caucasian). Obesity and other comorbidities (i blood pressure, CV disease) (b pp. 3701). The nature of the recipients original native Kidney disease and the risk of this disease recurring in the transplant. Rejection episodes ( b p. 408): 2 A single episode of rejection reduces 5-year graft survival by 7 10%. The greater the number of episodes, the worse the outcome. HLA antibodies ( b p. 3614): About 7 20% recipients develop anti-HLA antibodies post-transplantation. The development of such antibodies trebles the risk of graft failure (whether or not they are donor-specifi c). Donor-specifi c anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) are associated with chronic antibody-mediated rejection ( b p. 4146). Proteinuria: As in native kidneys, a marker of renal injury, the risk of progressive renal dysfunction, and overall CV morbidity and mortality. May also herald recurrent native disease.

TRANSPLANTATION OUTCOMES 345 346 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Basic transplant immunology Introduction A transplanted Kidney will be antigenically distinct from its new host and recognized as foreign and initiate an immune response, unless it is from a genetically identical individual (essentially, an identical twin). In the context of transplantation, these antigens are known as alloantigens (and the donor Kidney is often referred to as an allograft). The most relevant alloantigens to transplantation are a group of histocompatibility genes known as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Minor histocompatibility antigens are also relevant although less important.",

    "text": "Minor histocompatibility antigens are also relevant although less important. Alloantigen recognition triggers immune cell activity and the activation of multiple potent effectors of the immune response. Histocompatibility and allorecognition The MHC presents fragments of non-self proteins to T cells in order to initiate an immune response. In humans, the MHC genes on chromosome 6 encode a polymorphic group of proteins called human leucocyte antigens (HLA). Their main function is to present antigens to T cells. There are two classes: Class I HLA includes HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C and is present on all nucleated cells, including vascular endothelium. They exist as a heterodimer with B 2 microglobulin. Class I molecules present non-self peptides to cytotoxic CD8 T cells, leading to their activation. Self-antigens are not recognized, as immunological tolerance, to them, has developed during T cell maturation. Class II HLA includes HLA-DR, HLA-DQ and HLA-DP and is present mainly on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including macrophages, mesangial cells, and dendritic cells. Other cells can be induced to express class II HLA during conditions of infl ammation. They are also heterodimers but consist of two polymorphic chains (i. e. no B 2 microglobulin). Class II antigens present peptides to CD4 T cells, leading to their clonal expansion. In addition, activated CD4 cells release cytokines that activate CD8 cells. Each individual inherits an HLA allele from each parent (a haplotype). The recognition of transplanted HLA by recipient T cells is by d irect and indirect pathways (see Fig. 5. 10). Direct pathway. Donor (passenger) APCs present foreign peptides to recipient cytotoxic CD8 T cells, leading to their activation. This pathway is largely responsible for early acute cell-mediated rejection. Indirect pathway. Donor cells or donor proteins shed from cell surfaces are engulfed by recipient APCs and presented to recipient CD4 helper T cells. This is thought to mediate more chronic graft damage. The binding of a T cell to an APC leads to the initiation of the immune reaction. This process requires three distinct steps or signals : Signal 1 (TCR activation). Binding of APC MHC-peptide complex to the T cell receptor (TCR) activates multiple intracellular pathways. One of these pathways involves the phosphatase calcineurin (i intracellular BASIC TRANSPLANT IMMUNOLOGY 347 Ca2 l activation of calcineurin l activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) l IL-2 release (but only in the presence of signal 2). Signal 2 (co-stimulation). Binding of complementary co-stimulatory pathway molecules present on APC and T cells (e. g. CD40: CD40 ligand and ICAM: LFA1) l activation of tyrosine kinase, which, together with signal 1, leads to induction of IL-2 and other T cell activation genes. Other interactions, such as B7: CTLA4, are inhibitory. Signal 3. Signals 1 2 l induction of cytokine, cytokine receptors, and cell activation genes (including IL-2 and IL-2R) l clonal proliferation. If signal 1 occurs without the subsequent signal 2, then T cell activation is not initiated, and instead apoptosis results. T cell activation T cell activation involves their proliferation and clonal expansion (meaning all cells express the same TCR), prior to differentiation into effector cells (which no longer require co-stimulation for activation) (see Fig. 5. 11). CD4 effector cells include TH1, TH2, regulatory and memory cells: TH1 cells activate macrophages, provide help to B cells, and synthesize several important cytokines. TH2 cells mainly provide B cell help (including immunoglobulin class switching). TH17 cells are involved in infl ammatory responses (e. g. to bacteria). Regulatory T cells (Tregs) suppress T cell responses. Memory T cells are a component of immunological memory (the ability to respond promptly and intensely, following antigen representation).",

BASIC TRANSPLANT IMMUNOLOGY 349 Tolerance The holy grail of organ transplantation: permanent survival of a transplant without the need for maintenance immunosuppression. Tolerance implies that alloreactive cells have either been deleted or do not respond to transplanted alloantigens. An important and exciting focus of international research efforts in transplantation (see M ). Rare cases of tolerance are recognized in renal transplantation (usually in the context of non-compliance! ). The induction of tolerance has proved possible in rodent models but remains elusive in humans, probably because we have a much more extensive immunological memory. Many reports claim partial tolerance, based on the minimal use of immunosuppressive drugs (e. g. lower levels of maintenance immune suppression, following induction with alemtuzumab). Complete tolerance has been described in the context of renal after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from the same donor. This is because BMT may result in the total replacement of the recipients bone marrow (and 6 haematopoietic cells) with the donors a state known as full chimerism. Similar principles have been applied with some success to patients with multiple myeloma and end-stage renal disease undergoing combined BM and renal transplantation. It is also known that infusion of donor-derived bone marrow cells can improve graft survival, and there is interest in translating this into immunosuppressive strategies. Successful protocols have been reported, utilizing donor cell infusions (CD34 ve progenitor cells and CD3 ve T cells), but they require formidable conditioning regimens (total lymphoid irradiation and T cell depletion) so are unlikely to be universally accepted. In addition, these protocols involve well HLA-matched transplants. It is not clear how such approaches will translate to the much more challenging setting of HLA-mismatched transplantation (BMT across HLA barriers is problematic l i rejection and graft vs host disease). A likely future approach will be to specifi cally bioengineer cell therapy with haematopoietic stem cells (e. g. see M onestudy. org ). 350 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Pre-transplant work-up Patient selection All patients approaching end-stage renal disease should be considered for transplantation, unless there is an absolute contraindication.",

Habitual, irremediable, non-compliance. Note: age alone is not a contraindication to transplantation. Patient education Before formal pre-transplant investigations, potential transplant recipients should ideally attend a local education session. The purpose of this forum is to provide patients (and relatives) with a greater insight into the following: Risk and benefi ts of renal transplantation. Live donor transplantation vs deceased donor transplantation. The nature and rationale for work-up investigations. How long these may take. Waiting time for deceased donor kidneys. Different types of deceased donor; donation after brain death, donation after circulatory death, ECD. What to expect in the post-operative period. The nature and frequency of outpatient follow-up. Immunosuppression and its side effects. The crucial importance of compliance with medication. The sessions should be hosted by members of the entire transplant team, including nurse specialists, pharmacists, physicians, and surgeons. It is also an opportunity to introduce the patient to others who have previously undergone transplantation. Pre-transplant assessment Potential recipients must be fi t to undergo surgery and long-term immune suppression. Routine assessment starts with a detailed history and a PRE-TRANSPLANT WORK-UP 351 thorough physical examination. Most transplant centres have a checklist of work-up investigations (for example, see b p. 352). This assessment is a multidisciplinary process, during which both a nephrologist and a transplant surgeon should review the patient and the results of their investigations. Transplant coordinators, specialist nurses, psychologists, urologists, cardiologists, and tissue typists will also play important roles in the work-up of patients to a greater or lesser extent, depending on individual need. 2 In the UK, patients may be listed for deceased donation when Dialysis is predicted within the subsequent 6 months. It is important to avoid unnecessary delays (and investigations) annual mortality whilst awaiting a transplant is 7 6%.

Assessment for cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease burden in chronic kidney disease Advanced chronic kidney disease is associated with a High risk of CV disease, ranging from coronary artery disease (coronary artery disease) and Heart failure to peripheral vascular disease and stroke. Potential renal transplant candidates need to be scrutinized for CV disease and CV risk factors and to have them proactively treated to maximize graft and patient survival post-transplantation. PRE-TRANSPLANT WORK-UP 353 CV disease is the leading cause of death after transplantation. 7 50% of deaths with a functioning graft occurring within 30 days of transplantation are due to coronary artery disease. The relationship between chronic kidney disease and CV disease is described on b p. 198. Certain risk factors are discussed in the following section, as they are relevant for risk stratifi cation and guiding choice of pre-transplant cardiac investigations. CV assessment prior to transplantation is considered an essential exercise by most transplant centreshowever, optimal investigations and interventions remain controversial. Most centres take into consideration: (i) current cardiac symptoms; (ii) prior history of established cardiac disease; (iii) risk factors. (cid: 2) All potential recipients have a degree of CV risk, as relative risk of CV disease is disproportionally High in young end-stage renal disease patients. Risk factors Many centres use a single risk factor from the list below as a trigger for non-invasive cardiac stress testing. i blood pressure ( 9 LVH) and i lipids are not included, as they are so highly prevalent in end-stage renal disease patients. Diabetes. Age 50. Previous coronary revascularization. Established non-cardiac vascular disease (i. e. peripheral vascular disease or CVA). (See Table 5. 3. ) Abnormal resting ECG (other than LVH). Smoking. Dialysis duration 12 months. Previous renal transplant. Approach to CV assessment History.

All patients will need a CXR and an ECG. Echo if clinical suspicion of a valve lesion, cardiac failure, pericardial effusion, signifi cant LVH on ECG, or cardiomegaly on CXR. An ejection fraction 30% is considered a contraindication to deceased donor transplantation (l i perioperative mortality, poor early graft perfusion, and increased risk of transplant vein thrombosis). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) can identify patients at High risk of post-operative complications. Risk stratifi cation Based on the CV assessment, patients can be stratifi ed as follows: Symptomatic patients Symptomatic patients should be referred to a cardiologist for coronary angiography.",

    "text": "354 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Additional functional tests, such as dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE), may be considered, but the key symptomatic and prognostic question is whether the patient will benefi t from coronary revascularization. (cid: 2) The risks of contrast nephropathy 9 cholesterol emboli need careful consideration in this group of patients. Patients may be rendered temporarily, or permanently, Dialysis-dependent. Asymptomatic patients with risk factors Whilst there is no convincing evidence that anatomical or functional testing is of either diagnostic or prognostic value in asymptomatic patients without renal failure, it is generally accepted that patients w ith renal failure are a unique group and that such assessment is highly desirable. (cid: 2) The absence of symptoms is not always reliable many patients with end-stage renal disease have limited exercise capacity, and volume overload may obscure myocardial ischaemia. In diabetic patients, symptom burden is a poor indicator of ischaemia (autonomic neuropathy l defective anginal warning ). Asymptomatic patients with any of the risk factors listed should 6 undergo stress testing, with either a DSE or a myocardial perfusion scan (MPS). The interpretation of non-invasive cardiac investigations must be guarded in the context of end-stage renal disease (see Table 5. 1). The sensitivity, specifi city, and positive and negative predictive values of these investigations are shown in Table 5. 2. Head-to-head comparison of DSE vs MPS reveals that neither is better nor perfect, but both are superior to alternatives. The FAME study highlighted the importance of combining anatomical fi ndings with functional tests: Fractional fl ow reserve (FFR) may help to guide management of a coronary stenosis in an asymptomatic Dialysis patient. If the stenosis is associated with downstream ischaemia (identifi ed either by an abnormal FFR or a reversible perfusion defect), the patient should be offered revascularization. Asymptomatic patients without risk factors Resting ECG and CXR to determine the need for either an echo or MPS/DSE. Otherwise, no further investigation is usually necessary.

A High proportion of patients have baseline ECG abnormalities. Not recommended for transplant cardiac assessment.

Data concerning the annual incidence of cardiac events in chronic kidney disease patients after normal stress imaging test suggest rates increase from 4 12% within 2 years to 10 30% beyond 2 years. This implies cardiac rescreening should be undertaken every 2 years (sooner if symptomatic). It is interesting to note that cardiac event rates, following a normal MPS in the general population, are 1% per year, underlining the increased CV risk for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. Revascularization The purpose of coronary artery disease intervention (either by surgical means or percutaneously through the use of stenting) is to restore Blood fl ow to an ischaemic area of myocardium. Revascularization procedures do not alter the pathophysiological processes involved in coronary artery disease but simply serve to improve Blood fl ow and prevent infarction. The best method of revascularization for patients with end-stage renal disease has not been established. Studies can only be extrapolated from the general population, but support both surgical and percutaneous options as effective in symptomatic disease. CABG complication rates are 7 10% higher in ERSD patients. However, it is the treatment of choice for patients with multivessel disease and LV dysfunction ( l symptomatic and prognostic benefi t). Any patient who has had a STEMI/NSTEMI, but not required revascularization, should not be considered for transplantation until cleared by a cardiologist 6 months after the event (this will usually involve further investigation). Stented patients need to wait until dual antiplatelet therapy has ceased ( l intraoperative bleeding risk). Generally, 12 months for a drug-eluting stent and 3 months for a bare metal stent.

Patients with end-stage renal disease, caused or complicated by urinary tract obstruction ( 9 urinary infection), require urological assessment. Assessment of mental health Introduction Due attention should be given to psychosocial issues as they may impact on quality of life (and compliance) post transplant. When identifi ed, many are correctableeither with individualized treatment or through social intervention. The uncertainty of transplant listing may in itself cause anxiety. Furthermore, Dialysis may have already affected a patients ability to work, their social engagement, and their self-esteem. Psychosocial support, including counselling, formal psychiatric input, and social work may be necessary. Evaluation of a patients social situation, relationships, and fi nancial situation can be valuable, as many of these factors may be modifi able in anticipation of a transplant.",

    "text": "Rarely, the capacity of a patient to consent to treatment may require assessment. Pre-existing psychiatric illness Evidence suggests that transplant outcomes in patients with pre-existing mental health issues are suboptimal. However, a psychiatric disorder is not an absolute contraindication to transplantation, although careful evaluation is required. With adequate social support, Good insight, reliable interpersonal relationships, and coping strategies in place, patients with mental health issues can be considered for transplantation. Chronic illnesses, such as schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, may still have a Good outcome in selected stable patients. Severe personality disorders are considered a contraindication by most transplant centres. Substance misuse may interfere with compliance. Long-standing anxiety or affective disorders do not appear to predict worse outcomes after transplant. Drug issues (cid: 2) Corticosteroids have well-recognized neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including depression, mania, psychosis, and delirium. A minority of patients may suffer from neuropsychiatric ciclosporin (CIC) toxicity. Tacrolimus (TAC) has been associated with sleep disturbances and irritability. It is important to identify potential interactions between immune suppression and psychiatric medication prior to transplantation. Lithium should ideally be avoided post-transplant (nephrotoxicity), but any change in treatment will require a period of assessment to ensure mood stability. 360 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Compatibility: matching donor to recipient Introduction Five fundamental issues must be considered: Blood group. Tissue type (HLA). Anti-HLA antibodies (particularly donor-specifi c antibody, DSA). Donor characteristics. Recipient characteristics. Blood group ABO antigens are cell surface glycoproteins expressed not just on red Blood cells, but on many cell types, e. g. vascular endothelial cells including those in a transplanted Kidney. Naturally occurring anti-Blood group antibodies to non-self ABO antigens develop in early life (probably in response to exposure to bacterial antigens). Group O individuals develop both anti-A and anti-B antibody. Group A and B individuals develop anti-B or anti-A antibody, respectively. Group AB individuals do not develop antibodies. Circulating anti-A or anti-B antibody at the time of transplantation will recognize and bind ABO antigens on donor endothelium, activate complement, and cause catastrophic vascular injury ( l hyperacute rejection). For this reason, ABO-incompatible transplants are generally avoided, particularly in deceased donor transplantation. The same rules apply for transplantation and Blood transfusions, i. e. group O are universal donors and AB universal recipients. However, ABO-incompatible transplants can be contemplated in certain circumstances ( b p. 444). Tissue typing Many hundreds of HLA antigens exist, and HLA nomenclature (based on recognition with specifi c antisera and, more recently, DNA sequencing) has been gradually refi ned over time. HLA antigens are allocated numbers as they are identifi ed. Where newer antisera have allowed a refi nement of previous specifi cities, the antigens are referred to as split and shown in brackets, e. g. the antigen formerly known as HLA-A9 has been split into A-23 and -24 and written A-23(9) and A-24(9). DNA technology has revealed multiple different HLA alleles, and these are shown with an , e. g. HLA-A 0101 is an allele of HLA-A1. However, theses alleles are usually still described more broadly, using the wider traditional serological groupings. If an individual inherits the same HLA antigen from each parent, they are h omozygous for that locus. Some antigens are inherited together more often than might be anticipated by chance; this is known as linkage disequilibrium. COMPATIBILITY: MATCHING DONOR TO RECIPIENT 361 Relevance The most relevant HLA antigens to clinical transplantation, particularly organ allocation, are the 7 50 encompassed serologically by HLA-A and -B (class I) and HLA-DR (class II).",

The degree of mismatch (rather than match and, yes, this is very confusing! ) between the donor and recipient is usually quoted at these three loci, i. e. HLA identical donors are a 0-0-0 mismatch, whereas donor: recipient pairs who share one HLA-A, one HLA-B, and one HLA-DR are referred to as a 1-1-1 mismatch. If all are different, it is termed a 2-2-2 mismatch. There are a number of minor HLA antigens, but their clinical impact is minimal. Benefi ts of a well HLA-matched graft d incidence of acute rejection (less evident with modern immune suppression). d incidence of DGF. i long-term graft survival. HLA-DR matching appears the most powerful in this context, but the number of mismatches is important (see Fig. 5. 8).

Recipients may develop anti-HLA antibodies or memory T cells against mismatched antigens, making organs with these antigens subsequently unacceptable for a given recipient. Anti-HLA antibodies HLA matching alone is not suffi cient. Anti-HLA antibodies present in the recipient at the time of transplantation may cause aggressive rejection, particularly if directed against particular HLA antigens in the transplanted Kidney, termed donor-specifi c antibody (DSA). Patients are sensitized (i. e. develop anti-HLA antibodies) when previously exposed to non-self HLA antigens. HLA antibodies may recognize an epitope that is shared by multiple HLA molecules and are 6 often cross-reactive. Key sensitization events Previous organ transplant ( 2 the degree of mismatching is very important: a 0-0-0 mismatch is less likely to become sensitized). Previous pregnancy (directed against paternal HLA antigens). Previous Blood transfusion. Unknown (possibly caused by cross-reactivity with microbial antigens). 362 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Screening for HLA antibodies Historically, HLA antibody screening was undertaken with the complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assay and described in terms of panel reactivity. Panel reactive antibodies (PRA) PRA measures the antibody specifi cities in an individual serum sample against a panel of HLA antigens. CDC assay: the patients serum is incubated with lymphocytes from a panel of representative donors in the presence of complement. The PRA is expressed as the percentage of wells with cell lysis, e. g. a PRA of 45% implies recipient antibodies against 45% of the most commonly occurring antigens in that population. A PRA 10% generally defi nes a sensitized recipient and 85% highly sensitized. 2 The higher a patients PRA, the more likely they will have a positive cross-match ( b p. 363) at the time of transplantation. In more recent years, the CDC assay has been superseded by less cumbersome, and more sensitive, solid phase assays. HLA antibody screening with solid phase assays These are either ELISAor fl ow cytometry-based. Advantages over CDC: rapid, quantitative (strength of the fl uorescent signal indicates amount of antibody present), highly sensitive, fewer false ves, easier to identify antibody specifi cities, does not require lymphocytes, can detect non-complement fi xing antibodies. ELISA: purifi ed HLA antigens are bound to wells of an ELISA plate. Flow cytometry: purifi ed HLA antigens are bound to fl uorescently labelled microspheres. Now the gold standard technique.

Fluorescence intensity quantifi es positivity. Note: A virtual cross-match involves determining the presence or absence of DSA through the comparison of the patients known HLA antibody specifi city profi Blood to the HLA type of the potential donor, without carrying out a hot or acute CDC-XM or FC-XM. Interpreting the cross-match result T cells express class I HLA, and B cells express both class I and II HLA. HLA antibodies against class I will 6 be active against both T and B cells. 2 Since class I HLA is expressed on all nucleated cells, including donor vascular endothelium, a positive T cell cross-match is a contraindication to transplantation, as it implies pre-formed antibody will react with donor endothelium. X The signifi cance of an isolated positive B cell cross-match is less clear, but it is probably an oversimplifi cation to suggest that it indicates the presence of class II HLA antibodies that do not pose a threat to the graft. Furthermore, donor endothelium will express class II HLA under certain circumstances, especially infl ammation. CDC-XM and FC-XM are often performed (and interpreted) together. This interpretation is made easier if a recent recipient anti-HLA antibody screen is available, as antibodies causing a reaction in the cross-match might not always be anti-HLA. Positive T cell CDC-XM: a positive T cell CDC-XM almost always indicates anti-class I HLA antibodies. Transplantation is contraindicated. Positive B cell CDC-XM: may be a false positive, and transplantation may proceed under certain circumstances. However, transplantation is contraindicated if class II HLA DSA is known to be present (esp. if specifi c for HLA-DR). Positive FC-XM and negative CDC-XM: this implies antibody is present at Low titre. However, a positive T cell FC-XM contraindicates transplantation. X A positive B cell FC-XM is a more controversial area, and protocols differ from centre to centre. 2 Live donor transplantation can provide the opportunity to proceed with transplantation despite a DSA 9 a positive cross-match (b p. 444). COMPATIBILITY: MATCHING DONOR TO RECIPIENT 365 Donor characteristics There are several types of Kidney donor. Live Kidney donation is discussed on b p. 372. Deceased donors are the commonest source of transplant in many countries, including the USA and UK, although live donor programmes in some centres have recently exceeded deceased donor rates. Deceased donors are classifi ed according to mode of death. Donation after brain death (donation after brain death) Previously referred to as Heart-beating donors. The most important donor type historically. Once brainstem death has been diagnosed, the patient is legally dead and can be managed as a potential donor on ITU. This management aims to maintain organ suitability for transplantation. Essentially, the donor has irreversible structural brain damage and is unresponsive, in a coma, and ventilator-dependent. Systemic perfusion is preserved, and organ retrieval occurs whilst some degree of cardiac output remains (meaning ischaemic injury is minimized). See Academy of Medical Royal Colleges. A Code of Practice for the Diagnosis and Confi rmation of Death, October 2008. M org. uk/publications/reports-a-guidance. html. Donor management on ITU Treatment of infection. Line care. Airway management. Maintain MAP 60mmHg. Meticulous fl uid balance. Most need vasopressor support (e. g. dopamine 9 then noradrenaline). Maintain core temperature 35 C. Common complications: d blood pressure. Arrhythmias. Hypothermia. Diabetes insipidus ( l diuresis, i sodium ); treat with vasopressin.",

Warm and cold ischaemic time Warm ischaemic time: period between circulatory arrest and start of cold storage. WIT is extremely injurious to the Kidney. Cold ischaemic time: period of cold storage before transplantation. 366 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Donation after cardiac death (donation after circulatory death) Previously referred to as non-Heart-beating donors. The number of donation after circulatory death donors has increased signifi cantly over recent years. donation after circulatory death involves donors who are not brain-dead, but in whom treatment is withdrawn, as there is no prospect of recovery. This usually occurs in an ITU setting but may also be undertaken in accident and emergency departments. Organs are harvested at subsequent cardiorespiratory arrest. The time between treatment withdrawal and cardiorespiratory arrest will determine if the organs are viable for transplantation. The inevitable delay between cardiac arrest and organ perfusion results in a longer period of warm ischaemia time (WIT). WIT is extremely harmful to kidneys, so, in some countries, kidneys are allocated locally to prevent an additional lengthy period of cold ischaemia. Prolonged WIT increases DGF, but graft survival rates appear comparable to donation after brain death if donors are carefully selected. X However, outcomes for donation after circulatory death donors using more extended criteria ( b p. 368) are uncertain. donation after circulatory death kidneys are classifi ed, according to the Maastricht classifi cation: Category I: dead on arrival in hospital. Category II: unsuccessful resuscitation. Category III: expected cardiac arrest. Category IV: cardiac arrest in brainstem-dead donor. Category V: unexplained cardiac arrest in hospital. Categories II and III are the most common scenarios. donation after circulatory death can only occur in hospitals that have invested in the expertise, resources, and infrastructure necessary to support such a programme. Between 2011 and 2012, in the UK, there was an 8% increase in the number of deceased donors to 1, 088 (the largest number ever). The number of donation after brain death donors increased by 2% to 652, while the number of donation after circulatory death donors increased by 17% to 436 (see Fig. 5. 12).

A history of past treated cancer is more contentious. Primary brain tumours are an exception. Active infection, e. g. encephalitis, TB, HSV, CMV, syphilis: Donation may be possible if the organism and sensitivities are known and treatment has been established prior to donation. In some cases, HBV, HCV, HIV may be allocated to appropriate recipients ( b pp. 684, 690, 679 respectively). Medical comorbidity: X This is an increasingly controversial area, as factors, such as age 60, Diabetes mellitus, and i blood pressure, are no longer considered contraindications in many transplant centres (for ECD, see b p. 368). Deceased donation: opting in or opting out Organ donation requires consent of the donor or next of kin. In some countries, e. g. most of the UK, potential donors may have given consent during their lifetime, so-called opt in . Such systems often utilize resources, such as donor cards or donor registries (increasingly online). Although the next of kin may not have the automatic right to overrule the previously expressed wishes of a potential donor, it would be usual practice to take their wishes into account. In other countries, e. g. France, Spain (and Wales from 2015), potential donors are presumed to have given consent, unless they previously opt out . Advocates of this system point to increased donation rates in these territories, although critics suggest this is more a function of transplant coordination systems that are more sophisticated overall. egatnecreP 70 6069 5059 1849 017 N 777 770 751 764 793 809 899 959 1010 1088 20022003 20032004 20042005 20052006 20062007 20072008 20082009 20092010 20102010 20112012 Year Fig. 5. 15 Age of deceased donors in the UK, 2002 2012.

    "text": "The major factors that infl uence allocation of a Kidney to a potential recipients are: Time on the waiting list, with priority to those that have waited the longest. Age: priority to those younger than 18. HLA mismatch, with priority to a zero antigen mismatch. HLA antibodies, with priority to those with a High PRA or calculated RF. Medical priority, e. g. a patient has limited options for sustainable Dialysis access. There is a move toward more sophisticated scoring systems that attempt to improve outcomes by matching donor and recipient more effectively, particularly in terms of patient and graft survival. Such systems usually focus on criteria, such as: (i) estimated survival that a recipient of a specifi c donor Kidney may expect vs remaining on Dialysis; (ii) time already spent on Dialysis; and (iii) more objective measures of donor organ quality. Donor and recipient should be as closely biologically matched as possible; for instance, kidneys from elderly donors do not, on average, last as long as those from younger donors and may sensitize younger recipients to subsequent (better matched) grafts. Specifi c recipient issues Age: The proportion of wait-listed patients aged 50 is increasing. This not only refl ects longer waiting times, but also larger numbers of more elderly patients being considered for transplantation. This mandates a regular (re) assessment of both fi tness for, and the risk: benefi t ratio of, transplantation. The commonest cause of graft loss beyond age 65 is death with a functioning transplant. This means that long-term graft outcomes may be less important, and appropriate attention must be given to issues, such as quality of life. There is usually an attempt to match the age of donor with the recipient to ensure a suitable nephron dose . Race: Ensuring equal access to transplantation is a signifi cant challenge internationally, as is encouraging donation from all ethnic backgrounds to support HLA matching. The proportion of patients waiting for a Kidney from black, Asian, and Hispanic backgrounds is increasing. In the UK, 7 4% of donors are from ethnic minority groups while such groups represent 7 8% of the UK end-stage renal disease population. Median UK waiting times are Caucasian patients 7 1, 100 days; Asian patients 7 1, 400 days; black patients 7 1, 450 days. COMPATIBILITY: MATCHING DONOR TO RECIPIENT 371 Comorbidity: Diabetes is the commonest cause of end-stage renal disease amongst those wait-listed, followed by i blood pressure. This has implications for associated CV morbidity. Careful work-up is essential ( b p. 352) Size: A large recipient ideally requires adequate nephron mass to achieve a satisfactory post-transplant glomerular filtration rate. A Kidney from a small donor (e. g. paediatric) may not achieve this. It may be technically diffi cult to implant a Kidney from a large donor into a small recipient. Large recipient polycystic kidneys may limit placement of the new organ (unior bilateral native nephrectomies may be necessary before activation on the waiting list). 372 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Live donor transplantation Introduction 2 Living donor transplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage renal disease. Living donors enjoy better graft function and patient survival (b p. 340). They are the commonest donor type in many countries, and numbers have increased signifi cantly globally in recent years (now approaching 50% of all renal transplants). Live donors may be related or unrelated, although there is generally an established emotional relationship between the pair (e. g. spouse or close friend). Exchange schemes and protocols to reduce recipient ABO or HLA antibodies are helping to expand the live donor pool (b p. 444).",

XXX) (with donor/recipient anonymity). Advantages Better graft and patient survival than deceased donor transplantation regardless of genetic relationship and HLA mismatch. Pre-emptive transplants (i. e. pre-Dialysis) have the best outcome of all. Time on Dialysis is associated with poorer transplant outcomes. 7 35% of live donor transplants in the UK are pre-emptive. Live donor transplantation is elective surgery and easier to organize. Laparoscopic donor techniques have helped acceptability (b p. 378). Closer HLA matching may be possible. Live donor transplantation expands the overall donor pool leaving deceased donor kidneys for those with no other options. There is minimal ischaemic damage to graft ( 6 d DGF). Less potent immunosuppression (possibly). Psychological benefi ts (better compliance, sense of well-being, etc. ). Disadvantages Perioperative donor mortality is 7 1 in 3, 000 (causes: occult cardiac disease, venous thromboembolism). Major complications occur in 7 2% (intraoperative bleeding, wound problems, DVT). Minor complications occur in 7 20%. Stress to donor (and family).

Assessment of a potential live donor This is subject to several comprehensive guidelines, e. g. M bts. org. uk. LIVE DONOR TRANSPLANTATION 373 A successful live donor programme requires a multidisciplinary team approach. Willing to donate? Information and discussion are of paramount importance. This should be delivered through a mixture of culturally appropriate written and visual material as well as face-to-face consultations. A dedicated live donor team, separate from the potential recipients nephrologist, would usually undertake this. The risks of the live donor process, how the pathway works, and the nature of the necessary investigations should all be clearly explained. ABO compatibility ( b p. 360). HLA typing and donor-specifi c HLA antibodies ( b pp. 3603). The impact of HLA matching is much less powerful in live donor transplantation: a 1 haplotype mismatched live related graft 1-1-1 (e. g. parent to child) has similar outcomes to a 2-2-2 mismatched live unrelated graft (e. g. from a spouse) and, in all cases, the outcomes are as Good as for a 0-0-0 mismatched deceased donor Kidney. However, HLA matching can help to select between multiple potential donors: 0-0-0 mismatched grafts still have the best outcomes, and poorly HLA-matched grafts risk the subsequent development of DSA, with potential implications for subsequent repeat transplantation in younger patients.

This is a complex area, and many live donor programmes will have considerable expertise within their multidisciplinary team. Many donors fi nd donation a positive act, associated with increased self-esteem. However, this is not universal. Psychosocial assessment and support may be required (including formal psychiatric review in some cases). Support may need to continue post-donation. Formal mental health assessment is recommended for all non-directed altruistic donors in the UK. Donor anatomy: Renal USS: to check there are two normal-sized kidneys. Isotope renography (e. g. DMSA): for split renal function. If there is a difference, the Kidney with less function would generally be selected for transplantation. 374 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Arterial and venous anatomy: CTA is now generally favoured over the more invasive, but less revealing, angiography (computed tomography also yields additional anatomical information; e. g. the IVU phase will identify a duplex ureter). Some centres may prefer MRA. How many arteries and veins? Multiple arteries usually require bench reconstruction prior to transplantation. Will laparoscopic surgery be possible? The left Kidney is generally favoured as the renal vein is longer. Informed consent. The donor should meet the donor surgeon. In the UK, it is a mandatory requirement of the Human Tissue Authority (HTA) that all potential live donor transplants undergo evaluation by an independent assessor . The assessor must be satisfi ed that adequate information has been provided (and understood), that consent has been freely given (no coercion or rewards), and that the relationship between the pair is as described. The transplant must then proceed within a certain time frame (usually 6 months). If a donor is unsuitable, it is important that the reasons why are clearly explained (and that any necessary follow-up is organized). Donor nephrectomy. For techniques, see b p. 378. Donors should be seen 4 6 weeks post-surgery and then reviewed annually (check estimated glomerular filtration rate, blood pressure, and urinalysis 9 urine protein-to-creatinine ratio). This could be undertaken in primary care (but it is important that outcome data are collected by the transplant centre). Renal outcomes Following the initial decline in glomerular filtration rate (as half the donors nephron mass is removed at the time of surgery), the rate of loss of renal function is no faster than expected with normal ageing, in fact, residual hyperfi ltration leads to an increase in glomerular filtration rate to 770% of pre-donation level. There is a small increased risk of Low-grade proteinuria (s to hyperfi ltration in the remaining Kidney) and i blood pressure. However, donation increases the absolute cumulative risk of end-stage renal disease by 1%. There are data that suggest improved life expectancy for individuals who have donated, presumably refl ecting their evident fi tness at the time of donation and perhaps motivation to stay fi t post-donation. However, this may not continue to hold true as more patients are accepted to donate and their long-term follow-up improves. LIVE DONOR TRANSPLANTATION 375 Assessment of glomerular filtration rate for live donation In many countries (including the USA), glomerular filtration rate is estimated using Creatinine clearance (creatinine clearance) on a 24h Urine collection. estimated glomerular filtration rate, using equations, such as MDRD, are not acceptable, as they are not suffi ciently accurate when renal function is normal or near normal ( b p. 34). glomerular filtration rate may also be measured using radioisotopes, such as 5 1 creatinine-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (recommended in the UK). A suitable glomerular filtration rate for donation should be age-adjusted (see Fig. 5. 16 and Table 5.",

In the UK, it is suggested that potential donors with an exercise capacity of 4 METs (activities that require 4 METs include moderate cycling, skiing, tennis, and jogging) or who have 10% estimated risk of signifi cant coronary disease (b p. 470) should undergo cardiological assessment (essentially dynamic stress testing of some type). Obesity: A risk factor for perioperative complications, such as VTE, wound infection, chest infection. Potential association with subsequent chronic kidney disease, proteinuria, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Potential donors with a body mass index 35 should be discouraged, but given lifestyle advice and, if appropriate, weight loss goals. Moderately obese patients (body mass index 30 35kg/m2 ) should be counselled carefully concerning the additional perioperative and long-term risks and advised to lose weight prior to donation (and maintain this post-donation). Persistent microscopic haematuria: A relatively common fi nding ( 7 5%). Requires urological assessment, with urinary tract imaging and cystoscopy. X If urological investigations prove normal, many centres perform a renal biopsy to exclude signifi cant (and potentially progressive) glomerular disease; for example, IgA nephropathy would be a contraindication to donation, whereas thin membrane disease ( b p. 568), assuming appropriate assessment and counselling, might not. 378 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Live donor nephrectomy General issues The most important early complications are bleeding, venous thromboembolism, renal impairment, chest infection/post-op atelectasis, and inadequate Pain relief (see Box 5. 3). Ensure adequate hydration (e. g. IV crystalloid 1L over 6 8h, beginning pre-op), VTE prophylaxis (LMWH and compression stockings), adequate analgesia (see Box 5. 3), early mobilization, and physiotherapy, as needed. Live donor transplant recipients are often commenced on ciclosporin or tacrolimus a few days prior to the date of transplant, allowing therapeutic plasma levels to be reached and reducing the risk of early rejection. Open vs laparoscopic nephrectomy Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy is replacing open nephrectomy as the procedure of choice for live donor nephrectomy and has helped to increase donor rates. The Kidney is usually removed through a 6cm Pfannenstiel or a lower midline incision. Open nephrectomy involves a larger, more painful wound (often requiring rib resection) and a longer recovery time. Although overall complication rates are similar, laparoscopic nephrectomy is associated with less Pain, a smaller wound (and several smaller scars), a shorter hospital stay, and swifter resumption of normal activities. Disadvantages: laparoscopic techniques are more diffi cult to learn; there is less intraoperative control of bleeding, and warm ischaemic time is increased by a few minutes over open techniques. There are several variations: total laparoscopic nephrectomy, hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy (HALDN) and retroperitoneal donor nephrectomy (in the latter, the peritoneal cavity is not entered, so there is less risk of bowel injury and fewer subsequent adhesions). LIVE DONOR TRANSPLANTATION 379 Box 5. 3 Pain relief in live donors With post-operative attention often focused on the recipient, Pain in the donor may be overlooked.

On the ward: Paracetamol 1g qds PO/IV ( (cid: 2) if donor is 50kg, IV dose is 15mg/ kg/dose). nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, e. g. ibuprofen 400mg tds PO (unless patient intolerant/ allergic).

If Pain is inadequately controlled, ensure the PCA is set up correctly and being used appropriately. Then consider increasing bolus and background to 20 micrograms (ensure the patient is alert and respiratory rate is 12). Review regularly. Depending on patient progress, the PCA will hopefully only be necessary for 24 48h. However, adequate step-down analgesia, based on preceding PCA use, is essential.

If uncontrolled, consider restarting PCA. 380 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Immunosuppression: overview Introduction Successful transplantation between non-identical individuals became possible with the combined used of corticosteroids and azathioprine in the 1960s. However, severe rejection, often with graft loss, remained common. Solid organ transplantation was transformed by the introduction of ciclosporin in the 1980s, with a signifi cant reduction in acute rejection rates and improved long-term graft outcomes. The number of immune suppressive agents has grown considerably over the last two decades. Randomized trials have attempted to defi ne the ideal cocktail of drugs, but have generally been pharmaceutical company-driven, too short-term (often leading to the use of acute rejection, rather than graft outcomes as the primary endpoint), and too small to convincingly demonstrate any differences. This means there is no universal regimen each transplant centre will develop its own protocol, based on their interpretation of the available evidence, their local experience, and their local population. General principles To match the amount of immune suppression with the perceived degree of immunological risk. To use higher doses in the early part of transplantation when the risk of rejection is highest ( induction ), with gradual reduction, even withdrawal, of some agents over time ( maintenance ). To try to tailor immune suppression to the individual where possible. The use of ciclosporin with corticosteroids and azathioprine became known as triple therapy. Similar such regimens are still the cornerstone of many protocols modern triple therapy often comprises tacrolimus, corticosteroids, and MMF. Acute rejection is treated with an (immediate) escalation in immune suppression, often with a subsequent increase in maintenance therapy. Each immunosuppressive agent has a particular side effect profi Blood. However, the entire group is associated with an increased risk of infection (bacterial, viral, and fungal) and malignancy. 2 The more potent the immune suppression, the less chance of rejection and the greater chance of these side effects. As acute rejection rates have fallen and graft outcomes improved, both the short-term ( (cid: 2) infection) and long-term ( (cid: 2) CV disease, malignancy, nephrotoxicity) side effects of immune suppression have become increasingly familiar. Immune suppression is only effective if taken consistently and as prescribed. The stakes are High in non-compliant patients, but such non-adherence remains surprisingly common. It should be recognized that regimens are often burdensome, involving multiple tablets, with multiple side effects, taken at multiple times of day. IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: OVERVIEW 381 Key questions to ask of a transplant centres immune suppression protocols Is immune suppression the same for each patient or modifi ed, according to perceived immunological risk (see Box 5. 4)? What antibody ( biological agent), if any, is used at induction? If a depleting antibody is used, what are the protocols surrounding its safe administration? Is maintenance immune suppression based on ciclosporin or tacrolimus?",

What are the protocols for ABOor HLA-incompatible transplantation if they are performed? How is T cell-mediated rejection treated? How is acute antibody-mediated rejection treated? Box 5. 4 Estimating immunological risk X Many transplant centres aim to tailor immune suppression according to a stratifi cation of immunological risk. Criteria vary but, as an example: Low immunological risk: Recipients without HLA antibodies, or Recipients receiving a fi rst transplant Kidney from a HLA-identical sibling. Standard immunological risk: Recipients with HLA antibodies. Any of the following groups, regardless of presence or absence of HLA antibodies: Husband to wife, or child to mother. Second or subsequent Kidney transplant. Black recipient. High immunological risk: Recipients who are FC-XM-negative but who have a current, or historic, antibody directed against the transplant organ (usually arises in a live donor transplant context, as such organs would not be allocated to a recipient via deceased donor schemes). HLA-incompatible transplants require individualized immunosuppression regimens. 382 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Immunosuppression: induction Introduction Induction therapy is an initial period of intense immune suppression, given at the time of transplantation, to reduce the incidence of early acute rejection. It has two components: Higher initial doses of agents that will subsequently be used for maintenance, e. g. pulsed IV and High-dose oral corticosteroids and ciclosporin or tacrolimus, with higher early target therapeutic levels. Antibody induction with a biological agent; this will be with either a depleting or non-depleting antibody. Depleting antibodies: ATG, OKT3, alemtuzumab. Non-depleting antibodies: basiliximab. Antibody induction is used for 80% of transplants. In broad terms, depleting antibodies are favoured in the USA, whilst non-depleting antibodies are more widely used in the UK and Europe. X While the evidence that antibody induction reduces acute rejection is Good (depleting antibody non-depleting antibody), the effects on long-term graft outcome are less clear. Other potential advantages (depleting antibody non-depleting antibody): lower baseline maintenance immune suppression (esp. steroids), allows gradual introduction of CNI to assist recovery from DGF, facilitates higher immunological risk transplants (b p. 381). Potential disadvantages (depleting antibody non-depleting antibody): higher infection rates, greater long-term risk of malignancy. Non-depleting antibodies Basiliximab A monoclonal antibody directed against CD25, a component of the IL-2 receptor on activated T cells. Binding prevents IL-2-induced T cell proliferation and clonal expansion. Basiliximab is a chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibody that does not evoke an immune response. It consequently has a long half-life. Used for transplant induction only, not the treatment of rejection (there are many other T cell mitogens besides IL-2, it is ineffective in this context). Demonstrably reduces acute rejection in the fi rst year post-transplant ( 7 33%). Basiliximab: 20 magnesium IVI on day 0 and day 4. The fi rst infusion is usually started immediately pre-theatre. SE: surprisingly few. Infusion reactions are rare. Does not appear to signifi cantly increase the risk of infection or malignancy. IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: INDUCTION 383 Depleting antibodies Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) Polyclonal T cell-depleting antibodies are produced by immunizing animals with human thymic lymphocytes. Several are available, e. g. Thymoglobulin (produced in rabbits). Among the polyclonal antibodies are antibodies specifi c for components of the TCR (CD3, CD4, CD8) and cytokine receptors (including CD25) as well as adhesion molecules.",

Given as a 5mg IV bolus (can be administered peripherally). Anaphylaxis is more common and cytokine release syndromes almost universal and more severe (particularly on repeat dosing). These serious (sometimes very serious: non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, aseptic meningitis, and encephalopathy) side effects mean that OKT3 is now generally reserved for the treatment of refractory rejection, rather than for induction therapy. (cid: 2) Do not administer to volume-overloaded patients (diurese or ultrafi ltrate the patient, as necessary, fi rst). i infection and PTLD risk, as for other depleting agents. A 10-day course is usual. CD3 monitoring can be undertaken, as for thymoglobulin. Neutralizing antibodies may limit effi cacy. Rituximab A chimeric (mouse/human) mAb directed against CD20 (expressed on B cells but not plasma cells so it rarely causes hypogammaglobulinaemia). Binding induces apoptosis and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Causes rapid and sustained depletion (6 9 months) of both circulating and tissue-based B lymphocytes. Repeat administration of rituximab is sometimes based on measurement of circulating CD19 ve B cells. Main role (in transplantation), to date, has been to prevent resynthesis of HLA or ABO antibodies, following plasma exchange in ABOor HLA-incompatible transplants (see b p. 444). Premedication and prophylaxis, as for thymoglobulin. Infusion reactions and cytokine release syndrome are well recognized. A single dose of 375mg/m2 is given IV 2 4 weeks prior to transplantation (50 400mg/h). (cid: 2) Rituximab bound to B lymphocytes may lead to a false positive B cell cross-match. Role as induction therapy or in the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection remains to be defi ned. 386 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Immunosuppression: maintenance Introduction Maintenance immune suppression is given for the lifetime of the graft to prevent rejection. These agents are administered orally, and regimens usually involve several agents. Standard triple therapy consists of a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), an antimetabolite and corticosteroids. Calcineurin inhibitors: ciclosporin, tacrolimus The cornerstone of maintenance therapy over the last few decades. Ciclosporin (CIC) is a lipid-soluble peptide, derived from the fungus Tolyplacadium infl atum. Tacrolimus (TAC, previously known as FK506) is a macrolide antibiotic, isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces tsukubaensis. Both disrupt T cell signal 1 through binding intracytosolic immunophylins (cyclophylin or FKBP12). These complexes then bind calcineurin (a Protein phosphatase), preventing its interaction with substrates, such as NFAT, and reducing the transcription of T cell activation genes (including IL-2 and IL-2R). Therapeutic drug monitoring is mandatory: Both have a narrow therapeutic index: too little l inadequate immune suppression; too much l side effects ( (cid: 2) particularly nephrotoxicity). There is also signifi cant interpatient variation in drug metabolism. Drug concentrations are measured in whole Blood, as much is red Blood cell or plasma Protein-bound. 12h trough levels (C ) are generally measured.",

However, there has been a signifi cant d in acute rejection in many studies (including d steroid-resistant rejection), and a large meta-analysis has suggested d early graft loss. Ciclosporin Neoral , a microemulsion preparation, has been the main CIC formulation over recent years, but several generic preparations are now available. (cid: 2) There are important differences in bioavailability between formulations, so it is crucial that the patient is consistently prescribed the same brand.

Steroid withdrawal The problems associated with steroid use have made regimens involving their withdrawal popular, particularly in the USA. However, RCTs involving withdrawal at 3 4 months have shown signifi cantly i rejection (albeit with CIC-based regimens). Experience with TACand MMF-based regimens is more positive. However, the benefi ts of late steroid withdrawal from a maintenance dose are likely to be quite marginal. What are you trying to achieve in this situation? This risk/benefi t ratio needs careful explanation to the patient. Early withdrawal (e. g. fi rst week) or total avoidance is increasingly popular with antibody induction and TAC-/MMF-based regimens. Newer immune suppressants Belatacept A fusion Protein comprising an immunoglobulin domain and modifi ed CTLA4 (a T cell molecule, which forms part of the co-stimulatory signals required for T cell activation). It is designed to strongly bind the APC surface co-stimulatory ligands CD80 and CD86. Must be given IV every 4 6 weeks. Has been used in early studies to allow CNI avoidance. In addition, experimental studies have suggested that the interruption of co-stimulatory signals could lead to donor-specifi c graft tolerance.

A suitable strategy would be a short session (2 3 hours is adequate for potassium removal), minimal or zero heparin, and the minimum necessary ultrafiltration (often leaving the patient 7 1kg above their target weight). Pre-Dialysis patients It is unusual for these patients to require hemodialysis pre-op. Minor electrolyte/ fl uid disturbances may be managed conservatively, with Blood Glucose control, isotonic Sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, etc. , as appropriate. If there is no pre-existing vascular access, the benefi ts of Dialysis catheter insertion need to be weighed against the risks of time delay, DVT (femoral), pneumothorax (internal jugular), etc. If DGF is anticipated, ask the anaesthetist to site an internal jugular dialysis catheter intraoperatively. peritoneal dialysis patients Similar considerations as for pre-Dialysis patients tend to apply. Additionally, rapid exchanges can be used preoperatively. peritoneal dialysis may be used 394 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation post-operatively if the peritoneum has not been breached (talk to the operating surgeon). Writing the drug chart It is Good practice for transplant units to have their own clear guidelines for perioperative transplant prescribing, including sample drug charts for the immunosuppression protocols used. The general principles include: Diabetes medications Stop all regular medications, including oral hypoglycaemics and SC insulin. Commence an IV short-acting insulin sliding scale unless diet-controlled only. Regular medications will need careful retitration post-operatively once eating normally requirements may have changed due to improved renal function. Antihypertensives Fluid shifts, general anaesthesia, and opiate analgesia can all contribute to d blood pressure post-op. i blood pressure is preferred to d blood pressure post-op, as autoregulation is impaired and graft perfusion is 6 more blood pressure-dependent. All antihypertensives are generally stopped preoperatively. (cid: 2) Exceptions are beta-blockers (refl ex tachycardia/myocardial ischaemia) and other drugs used as anti-anginals or anti-arrhythmic, e. g. diltiazem, verapamil. Antiplatelets and anticoagulants The antiplatelet effects of aspirin and clopidogrel last at least 7 days. Monotherapy is not considered a contraindication to transplantation, and many routinely initiate Low-dose aspirin as prophylaxis against graft thrombosis. Dual antiplatelet therapy is generally considered a contraindication. As such, patients should not be transplant-listed until they have reverted to monotherapy (e. g. after 612 months for a drug-eluting stent). Warfarin: The INR should be corrected to at least 1. 5 prior to surgery (discuss with your surgeon). For live donor recipients, this can be achieved by omitting it from 5 days pre-op. The decision to admit for therapeutic IV heparin infusion pre-op depends on the indication (absolute, e. g. metallic MVR, recurrent VTE vs relative, e. g. atrial fibrillation). Reversal depends on the time available. If 6h, give 2mg vitamin potassium IV, and recheck in 4h. If surgery is imminent, reversal can reliably be achieved with concentrated vitamin potassium-dependent clotting factors (e. g. Beriplex 20 50IU/kg, depending on INR; discuss with haematology) or FFP 15mL/kg. You should not need to recheck INR prior to proceeding. (cid: 2) Effects only last 7 4 6h though. The effect of warfarin can be prolonged ensure adequate vitamin potassium loading, and recheck INR post-op, and then 12-hourly for 48h. PERIOPERATIVE CARE 395 chronic kidney disease-related drugs Stop: Phosphate binders. Vitamin D analogues, e. g. alfacalcidol (unless previous parathyroidectomy). Cinacalcet. Rebound hypercalcaemia can occur, so monitor closely. Iron. erythropoiesis-stimulating agent often stopped. Should continue if DGF to reduce the potential need for transfusion.

PCP: co-trimoxazole 480mg od (also covers UTI, toxoplasma). Alternatives include dapsone 50 100mg od or monthly pentamidine nebs. Oropharyngeal candidiasis: nystatin 1mL PO qds or amphotericin lozenges. CMV: valganciclovir (unless CMV D/R), dose according to glomerular filtration rate (see b p. 432) TB: local guidelines vary.

General surgical prophylaxis is often given at induction, e. g. cefuroxime 1. 5g IV and/or amikacin 500mg IV. For DD transplant, further regular prophylaxis may be continued until culture of the graft transport medium is available. Analgesia Give paracetamol 1g qds regularly PO/PR/IV unless contraindicated (reduce IV dose if 50kg). 396 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Patients will require opiate/opioid analgesia initially for comfort and to help them take deep breaths and cough. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is preferred immediately post-op. Morphine (1mg bolus, 5min lock-out) is an option, but its metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide is active and renally excreted. Fentanyl (10 15 micrograms bolus, 5min lock-out) does not accumulate. It has a shorter half-life so is more patient-responsive. Once patients are ready for oral analgesia, a moderately strong opioid can be used, e. g. oxycodone 2. 5 5mg qds or tramadol 50 100mg qds. (cid: 2) Do not forget to prescribe laxatives in conjunction with opiate analgesia. Post-operative assessment It is Good practice for the patient to have a detailed clinical assessment in recovery prior to transfer back to the ward to ensure they have recovered safely from anaesthesia, are haemodynamically stable, have appropriate fl uids and analgesia, and show no signs of haemorrhage or graft thrombosis necessitating immediate re-exploration. Talk to the surgeon the op note does not always tell the full story! Read the op note thoroughly any complications? Special instructions? Examine the anaesthetic chart stable haemodynamics? (look for vasopressor administration, e. g. metaraminol/ephedrine, and boluses of furosemide). What was the fl uid balance? Patients can be very fl uid-loaded. Was there immediate Urine output? Estimated Blood loss? Examine the drug chart was all induction immunosuppression given as planned? Careful clinical examination ideally, the patient should be: Alert, orientated, and comfortable. Able to cough. Well perfused warm peripherally. Normal lactate. Haemodynamically stable not tachycardic, Good blood pressure (MAP 80mmHg). On no, or minimal, supplemental O, with Good air entry to the 2 lung bases. Passing Urine unless DGF is anticipated. Additionally examine: Drain outputs and contents. Distal lower limb pulses compare to pre-op. Abdomen (some post-op tenderness to be expected but is it proportionate? ).

Always consider: what am I expecting from this graft, in this patient, at this time? Any deviations require urgent assessment, investigation, and intervention. Monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, O saturation hourly for at least 24h, then 4h. 2 Accurate fl uid balance charts, including hourly Urine and drain outputs for at least 48h, then 4h. Daily weights. Bloods: FBC and UE 6-hourly for 24h. Expect a modest fall in hemoglobin (Blood loss/haemodilution). Daily FBC, UE, CRP, glucose (bone and Liver profi Blood may be 3 x /weekly). 2 Trough CNI levels: 3 x /weekly, starting day 3 (unless live donor with pre-loading). Managing fl uid balance There is a broad spectrum of outcomes from the graft immediately post-transplant f rom a brisk diuresis 20L in 24 hours to complete anuria. Additionally, the recipients native UO may range from normal to anuric. As a general rule, daily fl uid balance should be 7 500mL (for insensible losses). This can be achieved by 100% replacement of the previous hours losses 40mL. This must be combined with regular careful clinical examination to detect hyper-/hypovolaemia and adjusted accordingly. If the patient is still polyuric after 48 72h, it may be being driven by this regimen. Try reducing to 75% replacement, and monitor for signs of hypovolaemia. Fluid choice Due to the electrolytes losses that can occur, it is best to use a balanced electrolyte solution, e. g. Hartmanns or Ringers lactate (especially if polyuria). The risk of them contributing to i potassium is Low, as they only contain 4 5mmol/L. 0. 9% NaCl should be avoided in High volume, as excess salt-loading and hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis may develop. Responding to Low Urine output Oliguria may be defi ned as UO 0. 5mL/kg/h. Remember, what are you expecting? DGF and oliguria are unusual in live donor kidneys or a donation after brain death Kidney with a short CIT. (cid: 2) The most worrying sign is oliguria (or anuria! ) developing in a patient previously passing Good Urine volumes. Causes include: Hypovolaemia (beware inaccurate charts, undocumented loose stools, etc. ). Catheter problems (obstruction, bypassing). Relative hypotension (esp. if the donor was hypertensive). 398 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Ureteric obstruction. Urinary leak (High drain volumes? ). CNI toxicity. Arterial or venous thrombosis. Hyperacute rejection (graft Pain, Edema, tenderness) is rare but should be checked for. Action Unless there are defi nite signs of fl uid overload, give a fl uid challenge: Rate of delivery is more important than choice of fl uid. Administer a rapid bolus of 250mL. Use additional variables to assess response, e. g. heart rate, blood pressure, JVP, CVP. Do not give repeated fl uid challenges for oliguria, unless there are signs of a positive impact, e. g. improved blood pressure or Low CVP rising to 8 12cmH O, otherwise there is a danger of pulmonary oedema. 2 Flush the catheter, and replace, if necessary. Send a drain Creatinine if volumes are High (b p. 402). Check/review CNI levels. Arrange an urgent Doppler USS to assess vascular patency and fl ow, RI, and signs of obstruction or collections. If all these factors are in order, the most likely diagnosis is DGF ( b p. 404). If DGF persists to day 5 7 post-op, then a surveillance transplant biopsy is usually undertaken.",

    "text": "If DGF persists to day 5 7 post-op, then a surveillance transplant biopsy is usually undertaken. There is no role for the use of furosemide or renal dose dopamine to augment Urine output. RRT post-transplant Unless immediate graft function occurs, Dialysis may be required. Patients should be reassured that this is not uncommon. (cid: 2) Haemodialysis post-transplant can actually increase/prolong DGF. Standard indications apply in the presence of oliguria: Hyperkalaemia: 6. 5mmol/L and/or ECG changes. Pulmonary oedema. Symptomatic uraemia. If patients are passing Good volumes of Urine, medical therapies may be more appropriate. Avoid calcium/potassium exchange resins. In addition, RRT may be required for: Safe transfusion of Blood products, e. g. if hemoglobin 70g/L. Reducing risk of uraemic bleeding for planned procedures, e. g. transplant biopsy. Aim to minimize ultrafiltration, and avoid intradialytic hypotension as much as possible. peritoneal dialysis may be used if the peritoneum has not been breached. General measures Remove IV lines, including central venous catheter, as soon as practical to avoid infection. Early oral intake, as advised by the surgical team. Encourage deep breathing exercises and early mobilization. Urinary catheter to stay until at least day 5 (protects the vesicoureteric anastomosis). PERIOPERATIVE CARE 399 Watch phosphate levels. Urinary phosphate excretion often precedes a falling Creatinine. Frank hypophosphataemia is relatively common. Encourage High phosphate foods; may require oral or IV supplementation. Remove drains when volume 50mL/24h (with surgical approval). Watch Blood sugars closely for the development of NODAT ( b p. 424). Encourage self-administration of medications prior to discharge. Do not forget subsequent induction immune suppression doses, e. g. day 4 basiliximab. 400 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation The transplant operation Organ retrieval Retrieval of multiple organs is the norm (i. e. Heart lung, Liver, renal, pancreas), and several retrieval teams are often present. Both kidneys are harvested and may be sent to different centres. The kidneys are perfused with a cooled balanced physiological solution in situ (e. g. with Marshalls or University of Wisconsin solution) prior to removal. Along with the Kidney, the renal artery (on a cuff of aorta), the renal vein(s) (with a cuff of IVC), and as much ureter as possible (with periureteral tissue to preserve its vascular supply) are removed. The kidneys are placed on ice for transport. Machine perfusion techniques are an alternative several types of apparatus are commercially available. Splenic tissue and mesenteric lymph nodes are also retrieved for cytotoxic cross-matching. Recipient operation The Kidney is carefully examined on the bench , paying particular attention to the arterial anatomy (accessory arteries cannot be sacrifi ced, as there is no collateral supply). Small veins may be more expendable, as there is some overlap in venous drainage. Vascular reconstruction may be necessary prior to implantation. The left renal vein is longer, making it easier to implant. Graft implantation is heterotopic, usually into the right iliac fossa (the right iliac vessels are generally more accessible), although some surgeons favour placing a right donor Kidney on the left side and vice versa (as Kidney orientation is easier). If a previous transplant remains in situ, the contralateral side will be favoured. An implantation biopsy may be taken (esp. if the donor is considered marginal) to help predict graft function in the post-operative period. Scoring systems are applied to these time zero biopsies in an attempt to predict subsequent graft outcomes, e. g. the Karpinski score is based on summation of damage to glomerular, tubular, interstitial, and vascular compartments. An oblique incision is made from above the symphysis pubis towards the anterior superior iliac spine. The operation is largely extra-/retroperitoneal. Note: the native kidneys are not removed.",

    "text": "The operation is largely extra-/retroperitoneal. Note: the native kidneys are not removed. Vascular anastomoses are usually end-to-side to the iliac vessels (preferably the external iliac artery use of the internal may lead to erectile dysfunction in 4 ). The ureter is joined to the recipient bladder. A submucosal tunnel (or oversew of bladder muscle) helps to prevent Urine refl ux. A JJ stent is usually placed to protect this anastomosis (removed cystoscopically at 7 4 weeks). A urethral catheter is left in situ for 5 days. A drain is usually left in the perirenal space. THE TRANSPLANT OPERATION 401 Intraoperative CVP is maintained at 10cmH O and MAP 90mmHg using crystalloid ( 9 albumin). 2 Mannitol (or furosemide) may be administered as the vascular clamps are released. Methylprednisolone (0. 5 1g) is also given intraoperatively. See Fig. 5. 17. Dual transplants Double transplants represent an attempt to increase the transplanted nephron mass. Dual transplants are increasing, as more ECD kidneys are accepted for transplantation. There are no universally agreed criteria: some centres will be guided by a pre-implant biopsy, some by donor characteristics alone, and some by both donor and recipient characteristics. Both kidneys are usually placed in the same iliac fossa, but one can be placed on each side in some circumstances. It is a signifi cantly longer operation than a single Kidney transplant, so intraoperative risks are higher. En bloc transplantation refers to a technique wherein both kidneys are retrieved together, with donor aorta and IVC still attached. They are then transplanted en bloc into the recipient. This is usually performed in the context of paediatric donation (age 5): it increases the transplanted nephron mass and helps make the surgical anastomoses less technically demanding.

May present with i heart rate, d blood pressure, i drain output, Blood loss from the surgical wound, d hemoglobin. USS or computed tomography may reveal a haematoma around the graft. Resuscitation, then urgent re-exploration is usually indicated. Wound infection The incidence has reduced with the use of perioperative antibiotics. Contributing factors include uraemia, steroids, sirolimus, Diabetes mellitus, older age, and obesity. Causative organisms are usually Gram ve. Vascular thrombosis/occlusion Occurs in 0. 5 5% of transplants. Risk factors: complex vascular anastomoses, d blood pressure, donor vascular disease, recipient thrombotic tendency (e. g. APS), recipient sickle cell disease ( l pre-transplant exchange transfusion to d sickle hemoglobin warm graft prior to reperfusion). Arterial Arterial thrombosis is usually secondary to a technical error (either during retrieval or during transplantation usually intimal injury). Usually presents with oliguria and deteriorating graft function (9 Pain). Requires urgent surgery, but graft loss is the usual outcome. Regular USS with Doppler is required to confi rm perfusion in those with DGF. Venous Suspect if sudden d UO, graft tenderness and Edema, macroscopic haematuria, Pain (often severe). Doppler USS will show thrombosis and reversed diastolic arterial fl ow. Management: surgical exploration. The Kidney will usually be removed (and reperfused) whilst the venous anastomosis is completely revised. Urinary leak Most commonly a technical problem with the vesicoureteric anastomosis or necrosis of the distal transplant ureter due to poor Blood supply. Rarely, a complication of transplant biopsy.",

Often silent but may be Painful (as the collection of irritant Urine expands), scrotal/labial Edema, d UO, i serum creatinine (resorbed urinary Creatinine), i drain volumes, wound leak, collection of fl uid on imaging. I nvestigation: biochemical analysis of drain (or aspirate) will reveal a High creatinine higher than serum (lymphocele fl uid has the same creatinine as serum). sodium and potassium are also High. Cystography/retrograde pyelography will demonstrate the source of the leak. M anagement: re-catheterize the bladder. If the ureteric stent has been removed, it may be reinserted (usually antegrade insertion) and left i n situ until the leak has sealed (may take weeks to months). If this conservative approach fails, then surgery is necessary. SURGICAL COMPLICATIONS 403 Lymphocele Graft implantation interrupts the pelvic lymphatics. This may result in a collection of lymph around the transplant (7 10% of transplants). Usually small and uncomplicated. May become large enough to obstruct the kidney or iliac veins (l thrombosis). Can cause leg Edema and DVT and may become infected. More common in those treated with sirolimus (b p. 390). Diagnosis is on USS (or computed tomography). Indications for intervention: discomfort, obstruction, or infection. Aspiration or drainage is usually carried out percutaneously. Recurrent lymphoceles may need fenestration to allow drainage into the peritoneal cavity. Early obstruction Early obstruction is usually caused by urethral catheter blockage by clots. Ureteral blockage from clot or oedema is rare if a JJ stent has been left i n situ ( (cid: 2) but suspect if i serum creatinine when it is removed). Extrinsic compression from a lymphocele may occur. USS will demonstrate hydronephrosis (but is often normal in early obstruction). Late Renal artery stenosis Transplant renal artery stenosis may occur early (either a technical complication due to vessel injury or s to neointimal hyperplasia) or late (often atheromatous build-up at the transplant artery origin). Presents with i serum creatinine (9 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker-related transplant dysfunction), increasing blood pressure, salt and Water retention. Rarely, a transplant bruit. Should also be suspected if progressive transplant dysfunction with unexplained scarring on biopsy. Investigation: Doppler USS, computed tomography angiography, MRA, formal angiography (according to local expertise). Percutaneous angioplasty can be undertaken, although recurrence is common ( l repeat angioplasty 9 stenting). If required, surgical correction is technically challenging. Ureteric stenosis Occurs in 1 5% of transplants. Almost always in the distal ureter and s to ischaemia (the ureter is supplied by the transplant renal artery; ischaemia l fi brosis). Other causes include: lymphoceles, BK virus ( b p. 436), urothelial tumours, and renal calculi. Investigation: USS will show hydronephrosis and allow nephrostomy placement. A nephrostogram will show the level of the obstruction. computed tomography and cystoscopy may be needed to determine the cause in some cases. Management: JJ stenting. Small strictures may be amenable to endourological dilatation, but surgical re-implantation is often required. Occasionally, a native ureter is mobilized and anastomosed to transplant pelvis. Bladder dysfunction Transplantation may uncover pre-existing bladder outfl ow obstruction or bladder dysfunction. Examine for a palpable bladder, DRE, USS bladder pre-/post-voiding and consider urodynamic studies. Bladder training may be required in patients who have undergone long-term Dialysis, as their bladders may have reduced capacity and muscle tone, resulting in signifi - cant urinary frequency. 404 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Graft dysfunction Introduction Immune factors are important to both acute rejection and chronic allograft dysfunction, but there are many other potential causes (b pp. 405, 414).

Vascular thrombosis. Ureteric leak or obstruction. Hyperacute rejection. Recurrent disease (2 focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, HUS). Delayed graft function (DGF) Occurs in the immediate post-operative period and can effectively be considered as acute tubular injury or acute kidney injury following transplantation (it is caused by an ischaemia-reperfusion injury). The recipient will usually be oliguric, unless they had a signifi cant Urine output pre-transplant (e. g. a pre-emptive transplant). DGF is unusual with living donors (7 3%) but affects 7 20% of deceased donor grafts overall (7 30% for ECD and 7 40% for donation after circulatory death kidneys). DGF has numerous defi nitions but is usually described as the need for 1 Dialysis post-transplantation. Of those patients with DGF: 7 50% will recover by day 10; 7 33% will recover between day 10 and 20; 7 10 15% will recover subsequently, and 7 2 15% will not recover at all (primary non-function).

Transplant biopsy (usually day 5 7) to confi rm diagnosis (histology: acute tubular injury) and exclude acute rejection. Repeat every 5 7 days if no improvement.

However, if serum creatinine is rapidly rising, rejection is deemed likely, or the patient is High-risk for any other reason (e. g. hemoglobin 80g/L; blood pressure requires additional treatment), then an inpatient biopsy, with at least an overnight stay, may be desirable. Pre-biopsy: USS: to exclude obstruction. blood pressure 160/90mmHg, preferably 140/90mmHg. hemoglobin ideally 80g/L. Normal clotting (patient and APTT 1. 2 x control). Platelet count 100 x 109 /L.

One core of tissue is usually adequate, although 2 are preferred (sampling of 10 glomeruli and 2 vessels is required for accurate Banff classifi cation). Avoid 4 passes with the biopsy needle. Call for a more experienced operator after two unsuccessful passes. Hypertension can be applied to the biopsy site for 10min. The patient remains on bed rest with a Good fl uid intake for 6h.

These very rarely become large enough to cause problems or require embolization. 408 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Acute rejection 2 Treat suspected rejection immediately. Introduction Acute rejection is defi ned as a sudden deterioration in graft function, associated with specifi c immunopathological changes which are classifi ed according to agreed international criteria (Banff classifi cation, see Table 5. 8). Acute rejection is described as either predominantly T cell-mediated or predominantly antibody-mediated (humoral), although, in reality, there is almost certain to be a degree of pathophysiological overlap. Key facts Modern immunosuppressive regimens have reduced the incidence of early acute rejection to 7 10 20%. 10% of patients experience rejection after 1 year ( late rejection is often associated with non-compliance). A single episode of rejection reduces 5-year graft survival by 7 10%. The classical presentation of fever, painful graft, and oligo-anuria is now very rare. Rejection usually presents with an asymptomatic rise in serum creatinine (or as a fi nding on a protocol or DGF transplant biopsy). Risk factors (see also b Box 5. 4, p. 381) Delayed graft function ( b p. 404). Sensitization with anti-HLA antibodies ( b pp. 3613). Repeat transplantation. HLA-mismatched graft ( b p. 361). No induction immunosuppressive therapy ( b p. 382). Non-TAC-/MMF-based immune suppression ( b p. 386). Poor compliance or other cause of inadequate immune suppression (e. g. recent Vomiting). Recent CMV infection (intentional reduction in immune suppression). Recent UTI (increased graft immunogenicity).",

    "text": "Recent CMV infection (intentional reduction in immune suppression). Recent UTI (increased graft immunogenicity). 3 Hyperacute rejection This catastrophic form of rejection occurs immediately on reperfusion of the transplanted Kidney and is due to the presence of pre-formed antibodies (anti-ABO or anti-HLA). These antibodies bind to donor endothelial cells where they activate complement and clotting cascades l vascular thrombosis. Graft loss is inevitable. Thankfully, it has been virtually eradicated by modern cross-matching techniques. T cell-mediated rejection Most common form of rejection ( 7 90%). Highest incidence in the fi rst 3 months post-transplantation. ACUTE REJECTION 409 T cell-mediated rejection may either be tubulointerstitial (more commonpreviously known as c ellular) or vascular or both. Tubulitis is the characteristic lesion of tubulointerstitial T cell-mediated rejection: mononuclear cells infi ltrate the walls and lumina of the tubules. Tubulitis is scored as mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the number of mononuclear cells within the tubular basement membrane (scored t1 3 ). In addition to T cells, infi ltrates often contain macrophages, eosinophils, and plasma cells. There is usually associated interstitial oedema. Intimal arteritis or endothelialitis is the characteristic lesion of vascular T cell-mediated rejection: mononuclear cells infi ltrate the arterial endothelium. More severe vascular rejection will demonstrate transmural arteritis, fi brinoid change 9 stromal haemorrhage (scored v1 3 ). Treatment T cell-mediated rejection without vascular involvement Corticosteroids: Methylprednisolone IV 500mg daily for 3 days. Consider increasing oral prednisolone to 0. 3mg/kg/day to a maximum 20mg, then taper by 5mg weekly to previous maintenance dose. Optimize maintenance immunosuppression: Switch CIC to TAC. Target trough concentration 10 12 micrograms/L. Optimize MMF dose. Target dose of 2g/day, if tolerated. Response expected within 5 days (7 75% response rate). Re-biopsy if no improvement. Refractory ( steroid-resistant ) or vascular (Banff IIB, III) T cell-mediated rejection Add T cell-depleting antibody (e. g. ATG) ( 7 90% response). For protocol, see b p. 384. If no response ( 7 5%), consider IVIg 2g/kg single dose (or 0. 4g/kg for fi ve doses). Humoral or antibody-mediated rejection Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) refers to rejection caused by antibodies directed against donor HLA, Blood group antigens, or other endothelial cell antigens. The dominant mechanism of injury is antibody-dependent, with activation of the classical complement pathway. Although antibody-mediated, T cells are vital for the initiation and maintenance of the B cell responses that lead to the generation of plasma cells and injurious antibody. The diagnosis of AMR requires evidence of graft dysfunction and is supported by the presence of the following features: Morphologic evidence of acute tissue injury: Acute tubular injury. Neutrophils and/or mononuclear cells in peritubular capillaries (PTC) 9 glomeruli 9 capillary thrombosis. 410 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Fibrinoid necrosis/intramural or transmural infl ammation in arteries. Immunopathological evidence of antibody action (often absent, so not essential to the diagnosis of AMR): C4d 9 (rarely) immunoglobulin in PTC. C4d is a complement degradation product, derived from classical pathway activation). Ig and complement in arterial fi brinoid necrosis. Serologic evidence of circulating antibodies to donor HLA (DSA) or other anti-donor endothelial antigen. Cases that meet only two out of the three criteria are considered suspicious for AMR. Acute T cell-mediated rejection may also be present. Treatment X Unfortunately, the evidence base is poor and mostly derived from single centre experiences. However, the treatment of AMR is based on four concepts: Suppression of T cell responses (e. g. depleting antibody, escalation in maintenance immune suppression (MMF, CNI)). Elimination of circulating antibody using plasma exchange or other immunoadsorption technique. Inhibition of residual antibody (e. g. IV immunoglobulin). Suppression or depletion of B cells (e. g. rituximab or splenectomy).",

ACUTE REJECTION 413 414 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Chronic allograft dysfunction Introduction Both immunological and non-immunological factors play a role in progressive graft dysfunction and loss over time (see Table 5. 9). Use of the previous descriptive term chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) is now discouraged, as a more pathologically specifi c diagnosis (or diagnoses) should always be sought. Chronic rejection implies an immune-mediated process, but optimum treatments are unknown. Shared histological features are of interstitial fi brosis and tubular atrophy (IF/TA). At 2 years, 7 70 90% of grafts will show features of IF/TA.

Most patients will be asymptomatic. Key investigations include: serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate. It is important to consider changes in these over time in a similar manner to native Kidney chronic kidney disease. Therapeutic drug levels, especially CNI levels. Again, these should be considered over time and in the context of an individual patients progress. What was their immunological risk? What were the donor characteristics of their graft? Have they had any rejection episodes? Have they developed any infections or other complications of immune suppression? Urinalysis and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio. Proteinuria is a marker of renal injury, as well as risk of progressive transplant dysfunction, and overall CV morbidity and mortality. It may also identify recurrent native disease.

Transplant biopsy (the majority). Some centres perform interval protocol biopsies , regardless of function (e. g. at 1, 3, 6, or 12 months), to assess overall graft health and individualize management, esp. immunosuppression. X The relevance of subclinical rejection on such protocol biopsies is uncertain. 2 The interpretation of a transplant biopsy performed for chronic dysfunction is complex and requires careful clinical-histological correlation, considering all the factors in Table 5. 9. Histology The Banff classifi cation includes both immune and non-immune chronic damage. Chronic active antibody-mediated rejection.

CV disease prevention ( b p. 422). Avoid nephrotoxins. Maintain Good fl uid balance. Management of chronic rejection Chronic active T cell-mediated rejection Generally treated as for acute T cell-mediated rejection (b p. 4089). X Chronic active antibody-mediated rejection Present in 7 25% of those undergoing assessment for loss of graft function. Optimum treatment is unclear studies are ongoing. Common strategies include optimizing general measures, switching from CIC to TAC, increasing MMF as tolerated. IVIg, PEX, and rituximab are used in some centres (as for acute antibody-mediated rejection), but benefi t is unproven. Management of CNI toxicity The earliest functional change is vasoconstriction, but structural toxicity, with histological change in arterioles, glomeruli, and tubules eventually supervenes. Some degree of damage is inevitable in all patients taking a CNI (50% within 12 months). CNI-induced arteriolar changes include Edema of the medial smooth muscle cells and occasional endothelial or smooth muscle cell necrosis. The mature lesion demonstrates PAS-positive hyaline nodules in the media and adventitia of the afferent arteriole (similar to hypertensive damage). TMA may also be present, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis can occur in the glomeruli as a s consequence of arteriolar injury. IF/TA is considered a non-specifi c secondary feature caused by nephron dropout. It is characteristically described as striped fi brosis in this context. Tubuloepithelial cell vacuolization 9 microcalcifi cation may be evident. CNI minimization Either: Dose reduction to aim for a lower therapeutic level. Complete withdrawal, usually with a switch to sirolimus.

These include: Explaining the situation to the patient, with appropriate psychosocial support. Management of the secondary complications of a falling glomerular filtration rate, including anaemia (with IV iron and an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, as necessary) and chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder. Ongoing control of blood pressure and CV risk. Early discussion regarding future Dialysis and possible retransplantation (ideally pre-emptively). The earlier this is undertaken, the greater chance the patient will be able to choose the most acceptable modality for them. Creation of Dialysis access. In some cases, this may still be functioning from earlier in their RRT career. (cid: 2) Immune suppression should not be stopped suddenly.

Transplant nephrectomy is an operation with appreciable associated morbidity. Indications: the graft is a source of infection or infl ammation (presenting as Pain, general malaise, haematuria, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent resistance). Removal of the graft to prevent HLA sensitization is controversial the patient may still become sensitized to antigens present in the vascular stump. 418 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Recurrent disease Introduction Recurrence of original disease following transplantation affects 7 10 20% of patients and accounts for 7 8% of graft failures at 10 years. It is an important differential in the assessment of a recipient with graft dysfunction, particularly in the presence of proteinuria. With the exception of primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and atypical HUS, which can recur immediately, recurrent glomerular disease tends to manifest months, or even years, after transplantation. Even then, recurrent disease may run an incipient course; for example, although evidence of recurrent IgA is present on a signifi cant number of transplant biopsies, it does not lead to graft dysfunction or loss in the majority (see Table 5. 10). Table 5. 10 Recurrent disease post-transplantation Recurrence rate Graft loss p focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 7 40% 7 50% IgA nephropathy 7 40% 7 5 10% Membranous 7 20 30% 7 20% MCGN I 7 20% 7 33% MCGN II 90% 7 25% Diabetic nephropathy 7 100% 5% HUS (D) 7 50% 80% Familial HUS (with complement 7 80 80% gene mutation) Primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis Risk factors for recurrence include a short time between initial presentation and end-stage renal disease, recurrence in a previous transplant ( l recurrence 80% for subsequent transplant), younger patients (a particular problem in paediatric transplantation where focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a common cause of end-stage renal disease), diffuse mesangial proliferation on native renal biopsy. Black patients appear to have a reduced risk. Familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a different disease, and recurrence is rare. Potential recurrence is not an absolute contraindication to live donor transplantation but requires careful assessment and discussion, as recurrence appears more common in this context. Presentation May present immediately post-transplant, with oliguria and graft dysfunction from acute tubular injury. This can mimic DGF. Urine should be tested daily for proteinuria, and nephrotic range proteinuria may develop within days to weeks of transplantation (associated with a fall in serum albumin). Urinary Protein excretion (e. g. urine protein-to-creatinine ratio) should be documented RECURRENT DISEASE 419 pre-transplant for later comparison. Recurrence after 1 year is unusual. Early transplant biopsy is likely to be normal on light microscopy (besides ATN/ATI), as it takes several months for the typical focal segmental glomerulosclerosis lesions to develop. However, EM will be abnormal, with podocyte foot process effacement. Treatment Diffi cult! Plasma exchange or immunoabsorption. Start as soon as proteinuria develops. Response in 7 50% but relapse common (long-term maintenance PEX is not an uncommon situation). PEX may be started pre-emptively in live donor and as cold ischaemic time allows in deceased donor transplantation. High-dose CIC (given IV in some protocols) is favoured. Steroids and cyclophosphamide (esp. children). Rituximab has been benefi cial in some case series. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker for proteinuria.

Some series have suggested a recurrence in the majority ( 7 60%) but clinically signifi cant disease in a minority only. Younger patients appear at greatest risk, as do those with aggressive disease in their native kidneys crescentic IgA nephropathy appears to carry a particularly High risk. No specifi c treatment, but blood pressure control should be meticulous, with regimens including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker. Membranous glomerulonephritis Recurrence risk of 7 20 30% and also the commonest d e novo form of glomerulonephritis post-transplant. It is not yet known if those with anti-PLA2 antibodies are at higher risk. Graft outcomes are relatively poor. In common with native disease, some patients will spontaneously remit, whilst others will have more progressive disease. Treatments have largely been extrapolated from native disease (where CNIs are commonly used! ). A potential role for rituximab is under investigation. MCGN Bears more than a passing resemblance to transplant glomerulopathy, but clinical context, immunofl uorescence, and EM should distinguish them. Younger age of onset and aggressive native disease appear to be more important risk factors for recurrent disease than histological subtype. Type I MCGN often has an underlying cause, so recurrence (and indeed the feasibility of transplantation) will be linked to this. Type II MCGN has a very High recurrence rate, a poor response to treatment, and a signifi cant rate of graft loss. 420 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Alport syndrome Transplanted Alports patients may rarely develop d e novo anti-GBM antibodies and a rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis (donor A 5 type IV collagen is recognized as non-self). This is extremely diffi cult to treat and has virtually 100% recurrence in subsequent transplants. Diabetic nephropathy Histological recurrence occurs eventually in 100% recipients (usually within 5 years) unless simultaneous Kidney pancreas transplantation has been undertaken (b p. 446). A reported cause of graft loss in 2%. Has an important implication for CV disease progression and patient survival. Transplantation in other systemic diseases, such as SLE, vasculitis, HBV, and HCV, is covered in the relevant section elsewhere in the book. Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) It is important to try and discriminate between d e novo post-transplant HUS and recurrence of D HUS or D HUS (a subset of the latter will be familial HUS, with a genetic basis). The rate of recurrence of D HUS is 1%. D HUS recurs in 7 50%, usually within a month of transplantation. D e novo HUS arises after transplantation and is discussed separately ( b p. 412). Presentation is usually with i serum creatinine, d platelet, and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA). Renal biopsy will reveal typical HUS changes of endothelial cell swelling, widened subendothelial spaces, and glomerular capillary fi brin deposits. Risk factors for recurrence are mutation of complement regulatory proteins (e. g. causing factor H or factor I defi ciency). Serum factor H and I concentration should be measured and a mutation analysis undertaken in all patients with HUS if transplantation is being contemplated. Previously, the risk of recurrence with almost inevitable graft loss, has been so High that transplantation, particularly live donor transplantation, has been relatively contraindicated. Eculizumab shows great promise for protecting renal allografts from post-transplant HUS, although it is unclear how long treatment should continue (particularly important, given the cost of the drug).

In general, after 73 months the focus begins to shift from immunological factors and rejection risk towards more long term concerns such as CV risk. Initial follow-up is intense; usually at least three clinic visits a week for the fi rst 1 2 months, gradually reducing to 7 1 visit monthly at 6 12 months, and eventually every 3 6 months. Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease) is the commonest cause of death with a functioning graft in renal transplant patients. Renal transplantation is considered cardioprotective Dialysis patients have 7 10 2 0 x increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality, and renal transplant patients have a 3 5 x increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality, when compared to the general population. Pre-transplantation cardiovascular disease management and screening are discussed in earlier sections. Immunosuppressive medications can exacerbate CV risk factors (see Table 5. 11). The relationship between falling glomerular filtration rate and increasing CV risk holds true in patients with renal allograft dysfunction. Stroke and sudden cardiac death are the main CV associations. Addressing CV risk factors should be a focus of care within the long-term management of the renal transplant recipient. Achieving optimal graft function is one of the most effective ways to reduce cardiovascular disease. Table 5. 11 Immune suppression and CV risk CV risk C orticosteroids CNIs M MF m TOR inhibitor Hypertension n n Dyslipidaemia n NODAT n n Proteinuria n n n d estimated glomerular filtration rate n n n Hypertension The rationale for controlling hypertension in transplant recipients is twofold and the same as in patients with chronic kidney disease, i. e. reduce CV risk and slow progressive loss of glomerular filtration rate. LONG-TERM TRANSPLANT FOLLOW UP 423 2 Hypertension has been identifi ed as a major predictor of graft survival in renal transplant recipients. blood pressure targets for transplant patients have mostly been extrapolated from RCT studies in the chronic kidney disease population (see b Chapter 3). Of note, there are no large-scale studies comparing different classes of antihypertensive drugs with a focus on reducing CV events in transplant recipients. Hypertension is common after transplantation due to: Pre-existing hypertension ( 7 90% of patients with end-stage renal disease have hypertension pre-transplantation). Established arterial stiffness (may improve over time but only slowly, if at all). Use of immunosuppressive drugs, particularly steroids (through i sodium retention) and CNIs ( i vasoactive and nephrotoxic effect). May occur in the setting of transplant renal artery stenosis. Approach to management Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines suggest a target blood pressure of 130/80mmHg. Many centres aim for a target blood pressure of 125/75mmHg if coexistent proteinuria (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 50mg/mmol). Patients should be educated regarding the benefi ts of lifestyle interventions for blood pressure control. Choice of drug class as per BHS/NICE guidelines (b p. 488). Of note: Drugs that block the renin angiotensin system may unmask a transplant renal artery stenosis. Hyperkalaemia is common in patients on CNIs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/ARBs (CNI l acidosis and distal tubule potassium retention). Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzyme l i CNI levels. Calcium antagonists reduce Blood Hypertension effectively and, theoretically, protect against the vasoconstrictor actions of CNIs. Dyslipidaemia Dyslipidaemia often results in raised total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides as well as increased levels of intermediate (atherogenic) lipoproteins.",

    "text": "Studies have shown that this dyslipidaemia, in the context of transplantation, is modifi able by reduction of immune suppression and the use of conventional lipid-lowering drugs. ALERT is the only larger RCT of statin treatment in renal transplant recipients and demonstrated a signifi cant reduction in non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiac death in the fl uvastatin treatment group. SHARP was another landmark renal statin study and, although transplant patients were excluded, many patients received a transplant in the follow-up period. Dyslipidaemia is common after transplantation due to: Pre-existing dyslipidaemia (60% of patients with end-stage renal disease have dyslipidaemia pre-transplant). 424 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Use of immunosuppressive drugs, particularly steroids, CNIs and mTOR inhibitors (see Table 5. 11). Change in dietary intake in the absence of restriction associated with end-stage renal disease. Approach to management CV risk tables are not always helpful in this cohort of patients, but, in the UK, guidelines suggest any transplant patient with a 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of 20% should take a statin. Treatment should be to a target TC 4mmol/L, LDL cholesterol 2mmol/L. However, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes practice guidelines have recently moved away from such numeric targets, recommending statin treatment for all transplant recipients (b p. 205). Patients should be educated regarding the benefi ts of lifestyle interventions for lipid control. Review immune suppression, and moderate where possible. Options regarding statin choice should take into consideration the following: Simvastatin, lovastatin, and rosuvastatin are metabolized by microsomal enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4, which is inhibited by calcineurin inhibitors, particularly CIC. The resultant increased statin concentrations can cause adverse effects. The prescription of simvastatin and CIC is contraindicated by the MHRA in the UK. The others should be started at lower doses and titrated carefully. Drugs with alternative metabolism, such as pravastatin, fl uvastatin, and atorvastatin, are reported to be safe and effective at standard doses, but should be introduced and titrated carefully under supervision. There are no data to support fi brates, and concerns regarding side effect profi Blood in the presence of Low estimated glomerular filtration rate, makes them a less favourable choice. New-onset Diabetes after transplantation New-onset Diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is due to both impairment of insulin secretion and increased insulin resistance. Incidence of new-onset Diabetes is between 5 and 20% in the fi rst year after transplantation. 2 The presence of Diabetes is an important risk factor for both poor patient and graft survival. This is in the context of both pre-existing Diabetes and NODAT. NODAT is associated with a doubling in all-cause mortality and a tripling in CV events. Steroid avoidance regimens have reported that NODAT occurred less frequently and, when it did, it was less severe. However, overall benefi ts were modest and associated with increased risk of acute rejection. Risk factors for new-onset Diabetes after transplantation are: Age 60. Use of certain immunosuppressive drugs, particularly steroids, CNIs, and mTOR inhibitors (impaired insulin secretion). Non-Caucasian ethnicity (particularly Afro-Caribbean and Indo-Asian patients). Deceased donor transplants. body mass index 30kg/m2. LONG-TERM TRANSPLANT FOLLOW UP 425 Family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. History of Diabetes in pregnancy. HCV ve patients. Predisposing genetic markers (e. g. T CF7L2 and PPARG ). Approach to management Use WHO criteria for diagnosis. Patients should be educated regarding the benefi ts of lifestyle interventions for diabetic control. Review medications many would consider steroid withdrawal, although the evidence of benefi t is slim (despite the well-recognized risk of late steroid withdrawal, b p. 391).

(cid: 2) Exercise caution with thiazolidinediones, acarbose, and exenatide if estimated glomerular filtration rate 30mL/min. Refer to local guidelines for insulin choice. Standard screening for diabetic complications apply for patients with NODAT, monitoring for neuropathy, retinopathy, and vigilant foot care (due to infection risk in patients on immune suppression). Bone and mineral metabolism Transplant recipients are at increased risk of fracture. This risk is higher than in Dialysis patients. Risk factors: steroid use, CNIs, previous renal osteodystrophy, persistent hyperparathyroidism, metabolic acidosis, hypophosphataemia, lack of physical activity, post-menopausal , smoking. Almost all patients will enter transplantation with a degree of renal osteodystrophy and this will persist post-transplant. Patients who have an impaired post-transplant function (e. g. estimated glomerular filtration rate 30mL/min) are best viewed using a chronic Kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder paradigm, i. e. they are more accurately described as having osteodystrophy than osteoporosis. This may explain why DEXA scanning does not accurately predict fracture risk in transplant recipients (even though BMD rapidly decreases in the fi rst year). Management: control of serum phosphate and parathyroid hormone, according to familiar chronic kidney disease targets ( b p. 244); correct nutritional vitamin D defi ciency (e. g. if 25-OH vitamin D 30 micrograms/L). Those with persistent tertiary hyperparathyroidism should be observed for a year to see if spontaneous involution occurs prior to proceeding with parathyroidectomy. Cinacalcet can be a useful means of ameliorating hypercalcaemia during this period. Those patients with a glomerular filtration rate 30mL/min can be generally be managed as osteoporosis. Management: oral calcium and vitamin D preparations, correction of acidosis, oral bisphosphonates, steroid minimization. 426 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Post-transplant infections Introduction Transplant recipients are susceptible to a wide variety of infectious pathogens (see Fig. 5. 19). The general principles of management in this group are: (i) to prevent certain common infections (particularly in the fi rst few months after transplantation or during periods of heavier immune suppression); (ii) to be aware of the spectrum of infectious disease to which recipients are vulnerable at particular times post-transplantation; and (iii) to rapidly assess and treat transplant patients presenting with suspected infectious disease. Strategies for prevention might include: Perioperative broad-spectrum antibiotics. Co-trimoxazole (PCP, UTI). Isoniazid for TB in High-risk recipients ( b p. 395). Valganciclovir for CMV in at-risk recipients ( b p. 432). Screening of Dialysis patients for MRSA (nose, throat, and perineal swabs), with eradication therapy if ve. VZV vaccination for non-immune patients pre-transplantation (see Table 5. 12). Pneumococcal and infl uenza vaccinations. HBV vaccination for all those with advanced chronic kidney disease (see Table 5. 12). Timing of infection Infections in the fi rst month Standard post-operative infections related to the procedure itself see Surgical complications ( b p. 402). Including wound, chest, and infected haematomas or lymphoceles. Urinary tract infection: common. Anuric Dialysis patients often have small-capacity dysfunctional bladders, and indwelling urinary catheters or ureteric stents further increase risk. If recurrent, USS transplant, and assess bladder emptying. Is there a relevant abnormality of the native kidneys that may be contributing? Ureteric stent may require early removal.

CMV is a DNA (herpes type) virus that infects 7 50% of the normal population. Following p CMV infection (usually asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals), CMV persists in the host, and reactivation usually results in asymptomatic viral shedding. The presence of CMV IgG in serum identifi es past infection (7 50% of adults). CMV is transmitted in saliva and other body fl uids (including Blood) as well as in transplanted organs (CMV infection via Blood products is now rare, as leucocyte-depleted products are usually supplied). CMV in transplant recipients Immunosuppression promotes reactivation of latent CMV in the transplanted organ and/or tissues of the recipient. The resultant active CMV infection may be asymptomatic or result in CMV disease. 2 Donor/recipient pre-transplant CMV serological status is important in determining the risk of CMV infection/disease (see Table 5. 13). Symptomatic CMV disease is largely confi ned to the fi rst 6 months post-transplant but may present later, especially in High-risk recipients who cease prophylaxis. CMV disease CMV disease is manifested by fever (38 C for 2 days over a 4-day period), d WCC, d platelet. Malaise, Fatigue, fever, myalgia, and night sweats are also common. (cid: 2) CMV causes further host immunosuppression (predisposing to s invasion esp. PCP and fungi). CMV end-organ disease Hepatitis. Pneumonitis. GI: diarrhoea (colitis), abdominal Pain, nausea, dysphagia. Transplant dysfunction: Due to invasive CMV disease (cid: 2) OR due to rejection (CMV increases the expression of graft HLA antigens). CMV retinitis is unusual and occurs late (usually 6 months).

Routine surveillance should commence at 2 weeks post-transplant and continue for 12 months (weekly for the fi rst 3 months and monthly thereafter). It is unnecessary to perform viral surveillance in D R patients or in D R patients receiving prophylactic valganciclovir. Some centres issue prophylaxis to all, but D R , recipients. Interpretation of CMV viral load results Rapid increases in CMV viral load (the trend), rather than isolated results, are predictive of development of CMV disease. Routine surveillance forms the basis for pre-emptive therapy. The goal is to detect active CMV viraemia in order to facilitate prevention of symptomatic CMV infection/end-organ disease. Both international units (international unit) and logs are often reported. A change of one log or more in the space of 3 or 4 days is likely to be signifi cant. Pre-emptive treatment This strategy includes both reduction of immunosuppression, where possible, and the institution of treatment doses of valganciclovir to prevent or ameliorate clinical CMV disease. Valganciclovir 900mg PO bd, adjusted for renal function, for a minimum of 2 weeks or until CMV viral load is undetectable (see Table 5. 14). For patients who are CMV-negative pre-transplant, detection of CMV viraemia is consistent with primary CMV infection. The patient should be clinically reviewed ASAP. Immediate reduction of immunosuppression and initiation of pre-emptive antiviral therapy should be considered. If the patient was seropositive pre-transplant and is asymptomatic and the viral loads detected are Low and not rapidly increasing, it may be appropriate to either retest in 1 week or to reduce immune suppression and then retest. In contrast, a rapidly increasing viral load, with or without symptoms, would suggest the need to commence antiviral therapy, with additional reduction of immunosuppression. Management of CMV disease Reduction of immunosuppression Review immunosuppressive therapy, and stop/reduce one agent, usually MMF (or AZA). Do not recommence the discontinued drug for a minimum of 1 month, unless rejection occurs. CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV) 433 CMV relapse is common, usually presenting 1 4 weeks after completion of treatment, and is more likely if immunosuppressive therapy is reinstated during this period. Antiviral therapy Oral valganciclovir 900mg PO bd, adjusted for renal function. 2 Note the higher dose frequency required for pre-emptive therapy and for treatment of CMV syndrome/disease vs prophylaxis. IV ganciclovir 5mg/kg IV bd, adjusted for renal function. IV therapy is generally reserved for patients unable to tolerate oral treatment. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is used as an adjunct for pneumonitis (IVIg 500mg/kg every other day for a total of 10 doses). Duration of therapy Treatment should be given for a minimum of 2 weeks and continued until the CMV viral load in whole Blood is undetectable on at least one occasion. Treatment of end-organ CMV disease should be continued for a minimum of 3 weeks and continued until the CMV viral load in whole Blood is undetectable on at least one occasion.

CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV) 435 436 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation BK virus nephropathy Introduction Polyomaviruses are ubiquitous but rarely cause clinical illness. Only two virus strains are known to be pathogenic in humans: Polyomavirus hominis 1 (BK) and P olyomavirus hominis 2 (JC) (named with the initials of the individuals from whom they were fi rst isolated), and these only cause disease in immunocompromised patients. BK virus causes viral nephropathy (polyomavirus-associated nephropathy, PVAN) as well as haemorrhagic cystitis and ureteric ulceration and stenosis ( 9 obstruction). JC virus causes a viral encephalopathy. Primary BK virus infection occurs in early life, resulting in almost universal seropositivity. The virus persists in the urinary tract (including latency in tubular cells), and viral shedding into the Urine is relatively common (particularly older patients, patients with Diabetes, HIV-infected and transplant patients). There are several genotypes, so, although a recipient may have acquired partial immunity to one genotype, the allograft may exposure them to another. Over the last 20 years, PVAN has emerged as an important cause of allograft dysfunction (perhaps refl ecting the more potent immune suppression introduced during that European Renal Association). Risk factors appear to include: donor seropositive and recipient seronegative (usually paediatric recipient), signifi cant HLA mismatch, graft injury of other cause, acute rejection, and potency of immune suppression. PVAN occurs in 7 5% of Kidney transplant recipients. Viraemia occurs in a greater proportion (7 10%), and BK viruria is even more common. The risk of graft failure is High, with 3and 5-year graft survival rates of 7 65% and 7 55%, respectively. Clinical features Often an asymptomatic increase in serum creatinine ( 7 9 18 months after transplantation). Diagnosis Urine cytology. Infected tubular cells are shed into the Urine these so-called decoy cells (with ground glass intranuclear inclusions) are present in 90% of infected patients (10 decoy cells/hpf suggests disease). This fi nding precedes viraemia by weeks and nephropathy by months. protein-creatinine ratio quantifi cation of virus in Urine or Blood is now widely available. These are very sensitive but less specifi c. Some advocate monitoring for BK viraemia (e. g. screen monthly for the post-transplant year) so that pre-emptive changes can be made to immune suppression before BK nephropathy supervenes. Renal biopsy is necessary to confi rm the diagnosis (although PVAN is unlikely if Blood and Urine protein-creatinine ratio are normal). Histology. The characteristic fi nding is tubulointerstitial nephritis with a mononuclear cell infi ltrate, along with viral cytopathic changes, such as inclusions in tubular cells.

This relates to urinary tract instrumentation, poor bladder function, other pre-existing urinary tract abnormalities, and immune suppression. It is most common in the fi rst year and associated with higher rates of hospital admission. More common in . Prevention Patients with recurrent UTIs should undergo urological investigation prior to transplantation. Those taking prophylactic antibiotics pre-transplant may need to continue them post-transplant co-trimoxazole for PCP prophylaxis will provide some cover. Broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis is administered preoperatively. Ensure timely removal of urinary catheter (usually 5 days) and ureteric stent (usually 4 6 weeks). Clinical features Asymptomatic, with incidental detection on urinalysis/MSU more common in this group (and more likely to develop into a symptomatic infection). Irritative urinary tract symptoms dysuria, frequency, nocturia. Graft pyelonephritis: fever, graft tenderness, often systemically unwell with graft dysfunction. Systemic infl ammatory response syndrome l septic shock. (cid: 2) Note: UTI is a risk factor for rejection. Diagnosis Urinalysis. MSU for M, CS. Transplant (and native Kidney) USS: exclude obstruction. Microbiology E. coli is the most common pathogen. Others: enterococci, Pseudomonas, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Enterobacter. Treatment Empirical antibiotics should be started after an MSU has been obtained in symptomatic patients. Therapy should be guided by sensitivities ( (cid: 2) a signifi cant proportion of infections will be resistant to fi rst-line antibiotics, with increasing detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase organisms). Discuss complex cases with microbiology. Avoid nephrotoxic antibiotics, and adjust doses, according to renal function. Graft pyelonephritis: co-amoxiclav IV for 10 14 days ( gentamicin IV). Convert to oral if clinically improving and afebrile for 24h. If penicillin-allergic, give 1 2 doses gentamicin, then review culture results. POST-TRANSPLANT UTI 439 Recurrent UTI Clarify previous infective episodes, duration of treatment, compliance, and whether negative Urine culture was obtained following treatment. Ensure adequate bladder emptying (USS). Consider urodynamics. Late UTIs (6 months) are associated with worse graft outcomes: consider DMSA for transplant scarring if deteriorating graft function. Consider cystoscopy, particularly if recurrent graft pyelonephritis.

    "text": "5 3. 0 x over an age-matched non-transplant population (as well as over agem atched Dialysis patients). There is a huge variation between tumour types. Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) has 7 100 x greater risk ( 7 200 x for squamous cell cancer); renal cell and urothelial cancer have 71 0x risk, and breast cancer in has approximately equal risk. Cancer is recorded as the cause of death in 7 10% of transplant recipients who die with a functioning graft (higher in some studies). Immune suppression is the most important risk factor, but others, including smoking, viral infections (e. g. EBV), and older age, are also relevant. Although donors (both living and deceased) are screened for malignancy, there are rare reports of malignancy being transmitted from donor to recipient. Mechanisms Increased risk is more a function of overall immune suppressant burden than of a particular immune suppressive agent. Most immune suppressants impair the cell cycle and cell growth across many different cell types. CNIs upregulate both TGF-B and VEGF, leading to increased angiogenesis and tumour spread in animal models. Azathioprine interrupts the repair of UV light-associated DNA damage in the skin. This may be aided by the viral-induced inhibition of the p53 tumour suppressor gene. PTLD is associated with EBV proliferation. Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) is associated with Kaposis sarcoma. Sirolimus and other mTOR inhibitors reduce angiogenesis, so it is hoped they may be associated with less malignancy than other agents. Studies are ongoing. Screening Ensure access to national screening programmes, such as cervical screening, mammography, and FOB testing. X PSA 9 DRE in 4 recipients aged 50 (or younger if family history of prostate cancer). Some advocate annual USS screening of native kidneys for renal cell cancer (particularly if known acquired cystic disease, i. e. cysts arising in atrophic end-stage renal disease kidneys). Prevention 2 Smoking cessation, self-examination, sun avoidance (appropriate clothing; sunblock; avoid sunburn), reporting of untoward symptoms. Education should start in the pre-transplant phase and be continually reinforced during transplant follow-up. Skin cancer 7 50% of transplant recipients will develop a non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) after 20 years (SCC BCC a reversal of the incidence in the general population). Skin type ((cid: 2) pale skin), human papilloma virus, and POST-TRANSPLANT MALIGNANCY 441 sun exposure (6 older age) all appear to be risk factors. Tumours are often multiple and metastasize more commonly (7 5%). 2 Advocate sun protection at all times, starting pre-transplant. Recommend regular self-surveillance and annual dermatological review (particularly if previous NMSC). Treatment: local excision, topical therapy, e. g. imiquimod, 5-fl uorouracil, podophyllin. Retinoids have been used for secondary prevention. Consider reduction of immune suppression. Stop AZA/MMF, if possible. X Conversion from a CNI to sirolimus may be advantageous (proven benefi t in Kaposis sarcoma). Studies are ongoing. Malignant melanoma and Kaposis sarcoma also occur more frequently in transplant recipients. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder Second most common post-transplant malignancy after NMSC. PTLD encompasses a range of disorders, from an EBV-associated infectious mononucleosis syndrome early after transplantation through to non-EBV- (and often non-B cell-) associated malignant lymphoma, occurring late after transplantation (see Table 5. 15). EBV and PTLD EBV is an overwhelming risk factor for PTLD. EBV is usually acquired in childhood. Most transplant recipients will be EBV-seropositive. However, EBV may be transmitted to an EBV-naive recipient from a donor Kidney. EBV-related lymphomas occur mainly within the fi rst year post-transplantation (90%). Immune suppression disrupts CD8 ve cytotoxic T cell EBV surveillance, allowing latently infected cells to undergo replication l eventual B cell transformation and immortalization. 2 Recipient and donor EBV serological status should be known pre-transplant.",

Management A multidisciplinary approach, involving transplant physicians, histopathologists, and haemato-oncologists is essential. Histological type is crucial to planning therapy.

This process can be tailored by measuring EBV-specifi c T cell subsets (their appearance with reduction of immunosuppression may herald regression of tumour). No evidence to support antiviral therapy. Rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) is usually the next step and has made a signifi cant difference to remission rates (B cell tumours are CD20 ve). Treatment of late and T cell PTLD requires more conventional chemotherapy, e. g. CHOP.

Worse prognosis with i age, non-EBV-associated disease, monomorphic disease, High LDH that is slow to fall with treatment. 444 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation ABOand HLA-incompatible transplantation Introduction Many patients have live donors come forward to donate, but the transplant cannot proceed, as they are not ABO-compatible or because they have a positive cross-match. Transplanting across Blood groups Blood group O individuals are universal donors and AB universal recipients. Until fairly recently, transplantation was only carried out in Blood group matched pairs or according to transfusion rules. This is no longer necessarily the case. Note: Blood group A patients can be subgrouped as A1 and A2. Those with A2 express much lower amounts of A antigen on cell (including endothelial) surfaces and can 6 be considered as Blood group O if the recipients have no (or Low) levels of circulating anti-A antibodies. This means that A2 to O transplants are relatively straightforward. In addition, anti-Blood group antibody removal to reduce anti-A and anti-B antibody titres to an acceptable range for transplantation (generally 1: 8) is increasingly common. Technique Plasma exchange or immunoabsorption are used to remove anti-A and anti-B antibody. The number of treatments will depend on the initial antibody titre. Treatment is often continued post-transplant.",

New antibody production is prevented by administration of rituximab usually 71 month prior to transplantation (previously a splenectomy was necessary). Induction therapy (often with a repeat dose of rituximab) is usual. Maintenance immune suppression will be TACand MMF-based. Antibody titres are measured regularly post-transplant (often daily initially). Anti-A and anti-B antibody titres rise over time but do not injure the graft (thought to be an example of immune accommodation). 2 It is imperative that anti-A and anti-B antibodies are not inadvertently transfused back to the recipient in a Blood transfusion or FFP. This means that only Blood group AB FFP or Blood products should generally be used. Packed red cells of the recipients type are safe to use. Discuss with your transfusion laboratory. 7 10% incidence of antibody-mediated rejection (the majority of grafts are C4d ve but with no other evidence of antibody-mediated rejection). Graft outcomes are excellent: 1and 3-year graft survival 96% and 94%, respectively. Transplanting across a positive cross-match The aim is to remove donor-specifi c anti-HLA antibodies prior to transplantation. This has proved more challenging than ABO-incompatible pairs. Meticulous assessment of the donor-specifi c cross-match is necessary. ABOAND HLA-INCOMPATIBLE TRANSPLANTATION 445 The goal is essentially to remove DSA until the CDC-XM becomes negative ( b pp. 3634). Unfortunately, antibody removal is often a temporary phenomenon. There is likely to be a memory immune response with induction of, and concomitant, T cell reaction. Antibody removal protocols are often complex, involving PEX (9 IVIg), rituximab, depleting antibody induction, steroids, TAC, and MMF. Serial DSAs are measured both preand post-transplantation. There is higher incidence of DGF and both antibody and T cell-mediated acute rejection ( 7 35%). Outcomes are generally comparable to deceased, rather than live, donor transplantation. 1-year graft survival 7 80%. Long-term data, particularly with respect to the incidence of chronic antibody-mediated rejection and graft outcomes, are awaited. Most pairs should be offered the paired scheme (see below) before proceeding. Live donor exchange schemes If a patient has a live donor but, for ABO or immunological reasons, a direct transplant cannot go ahead, donors and recipients may agree to swap kidneys (see Fig. 5. 22). This is coordinated centrally (e. g. by NHSBT in the UK). Very careful planning is required. Donor nephrectomies are carried out simultaneously in order to prevent a particular donor backing out after their relative has received a Kidney. A large pool is required for suitable exchanges to occur. Blood group O and highly sensitized patients are the least likely to be matched (as per the deceased donor list). Recipient A Recipient B Recipient C No Yes No Yes No Donor A Donor B Donor C Yes Fig. 5. 22 Donor A is unable to donate to recipient A for immunological reasons. The same is true of the pairs B and C. Using an exchange scheme, donor A donates to recipient B, donor B to recipient C, and donor C to recipient A. 446 CHAPTER 5 Transplantation Kidneypancreas transplantation Introduction Transplantation is the treatment of choice for diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease. In addition to Kidney transplantation alone, options are: Simultaneous Kidney pancreas transplantation (SPK) (7 80%).

Supplemental insulin is required by many recipients within 1 year and 90% by 5 years. Reasons include: Immune-mediated destruction (highly immunogenic). Insuffi cient islet cell mass (more than one donor needed). Drug toxicity (CNIs and steroids are toxic to islet cells). Recurrent transplantation is often necessary. Surgical technique for pancreas transplantation Two options: Bladder drainage. Kidney is transplanted into the left iliac fossa and exocrine secretions of the pancreas routed into the bladder via a duodenal cystotomy. Metabolic complications: Acidosis (HCO depletion) and sodium loss (l relative d blood pressure requiring 3 oral Sodium bicarbonate administration (e. g. 2g qds). Calcium bladder stones (alkaline Urine). Chemical cystitis/urethritis. Refl ux pancreatitis. Enteric drainage (generally preferred): exocrine secretions drain into bowel. Fewer metabolic complications. Immunosuppression. Similar to Kidney alone transplantation. Depleting antibodies more commonly used at induction. Steroid withdrawal often favoured, e. g. by 6 months. Graft thrombosis (rarely salvageable) is the commonest early cause of graft loss (prophylaxis with heparin 9 aspirin is usual). More morbidity in the fi rst year (length of hospital stay doubles, compared to Kidney alone). 20 30% chance of laparotomy during early post-transplant period (peripancreatic collections are common). Fungal infection more common than after Kidney alone; prophylaxis is common practice. Rejection essentially causes pancreatitis, with i serum amylase and lipase. If bladder drained, urinary lipase and amylase will d during rejection. (cid: 2) Hyperglycaemia implies the majority of islet cells have been destroyed and is 6 a worrying sign. Rejection in the pancreas is often diagnosed by biopsy of the Kidney transplant (pancreas biopsies are possible but are technically challenging there is a Banff classifi cation of pancreas allograft rejection). However, asynchronous rejection (when one of the organs rejects without a simultaneous process in the other) may occur. 85% and 70% 1and 5-year pancreas survival after SPK (higher Kidney survival); 95% 1-year patient survival.

It is the most common indication for prescription drug therapy (in 2009, the NHS in the UK funded 140 million primary care prescriptions for antihypertensive drugs at a cost of 700 million). The 2010 Health Survey for England (sample size 12, 000) found a prevalence of hypertension ( ≥ 140/90 or on antihypertensive medication) of 32% for and 27% for . This increases to 73% and 64% in the 75 age group. In England, only 13. 6% are registered on their GPs hypertension register. It is often found in association with other CV risk factors, rather than in isolation. It is responsible for a signifi cant burden to both individuals and society through coronary Heart disease, stroke, and other vascular disease. Signifi cant underdiagnosis and treatment remain common; the rule of halves still applies: 1/2 those with i blood pressure have not been diagnosed. 1/2 of those who have been diagnosed are not on treatment. 1/2 of those receiving treatment do not have adequate control. Classifying hypertension Essential hypertension is a heterogeneous genetic and environmental condition. Secondary hypertension implies i blood pressure is s to an underlying disorder and accounts for 75 10% of cases (b p. 474). Hypertension facts and fi gures Systolic blood pressure (SBP) increases with age until the 8th decade. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increases up to age 50, after which it plateaus or i slightly. DBP is the best indicator of CV risk 50 years. With i age, there is a shift to SBP as the principal risk predictor. Reduction in SBP of 20mmHg systolic or DBP of 10mmHg is associated with reductions in death from stroke and IHD of 7 50% (slightly more in younger patients, slightly less in older). This is consistent down to 115/75mmHg in at least one large meta-analysis. X However, the question of how Low to go? remains an important one. It is unclear if there is a threshold below which further reduction in blood pressure is no longer benefi cial; the so-called J-curve phenomenon (see b p. 468). Non-pharmacological strategies (i. e. lifestyle measures) have been shown to d blood pressure. Antihypertensive drug treatment not only d blood pressure, but also d complications. Patient education is paramount: i blood pressure is an asymptomatic condition, and benefi ts of treatment may not be immediately apparent to the patient.

Any cut-off point used to defi ne abnormal will be arbitrary. Normal blood pressure varies with race, sex, and age, so, even if an arbitrary defi nition of i blood pressure could be agreed, it would need to be adapted, according to the population in question. 2 In addition, an individual whose blood pressure is just below the defi ned cut-off has a virtually identical CV risk to one just above it. Blood Hypertension noitalupop ni ycneuqerF Fig. 6. 1 Distribution of blood pressure in any population: the cut-off for defi ning High blood pressure is arbitrary. Defi nition Perhaps the most useful defi nition is: Hypertension is a level of Blood Hypertension which places an individual at increased risk of cardiovascular events and, when treated, results in more benefi t than harm. SBP, pulse Hypertension, and CV risk SBP Historically, DBP was thought the best predictor of CV disease. It is now clear that SBP has a continuous independent relationship with stroke and IHD risk. It can be diffi cult to get SBP to target, particularly in the elderly. Pulse Hypertension (PP) and risk PP is SBP minus DBP. A wide PP more accurately predicts adverse CV outcome than SBP or DBP. PP appears to be a marker of arterial stiffness. PP may identify those with SBP at particularly High CV risk. At present, the majority of outcome data from clinical trials is for SBP and DBP, so the major guidelines are based on these, rather than on PP. 452 CHAPTER 6 Hypertension Pathogenesis: general Introduction The great apes do not get i blood pressure, nor do present-day hunter-gatherer populations (with a similar diet and lifestyle to that of our ancestors). It appears that there are important factors within our environment and diet that predispose to hypertension. Genetic infl uences are important but insuffi cient in isolation. The fi nal common pathway in chronic i blood pressure is i OH systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The earliest event in the development of i blood pressure is usually a rise in cardiac output (CO). i CO causes an increase in wall: lumen ratio in resistance vessels (to normalize wall stress). This leads to a sustained rise in SVR and causes chronic i blood pressure. CO is usually n ormal in those with established hypertension. blood pressure cardiac output (CO) x systemic vascular resistance (SVR) Central role of the Kidney Sodium excretion depends on renal perfusion Hypertension (the Guyton hypothesis). So i renal perfusion l Hypertension natriuresis. In i blood pressure, the curve describing this relationship is pushed to the right (see Fig. 6. 2). In most people, the renal Hypertension natriuresis curve is steep (a small increase in blood pressure l large i in salt excretion). If this curve is shallower, blood pressure will vary more widely with salt intake. This salt-sensitive i blood pressure occurs more commonly in black patients and in chronic kidney disease. Monogenic forms of i blood pressure (rare! ) suggest tubular ion transport mechanisms are important mediators of Blood Hypertension control. Afferent arteriolar Hypertension noitercxe muidoS Fig. 6. 2 In the normotensive individual, salt balance is maintained at a normal blood pressure. The slope of the curve is very steep such that dietary salt loading does not signifi cantly alter blood pressure. In hypertensive individuals, the curve is shifted to the right, though it remains parallel. Thus, on a normal Sodium diet, salt balance is maintained but at a higher blood pressure.",

    "text": "Thus, on a normal Sodium diet, salt balance is maintained but at a higher blood pressure. In salt-sensitive individuals, the rightward shift is accompanied by a depression of the slope (not shown). Thus, not only is the blood pressure set point on a normal diet elevated, but the blood pressure also increases in response to dietary salt loading. PATHOGENESIS: GENERAL 453 Salt intake and Blood Hypertension There is a large body of evidence supporting the role of High salt intake in the development of i blood pressure. Genetic disorders associated with i blood pressure often affect salt regulation. A High habitual salt intake is important for the development of the increase in blood pressure with age. The effects of salt appear dose-dependent. A key study, the Intersalt study, found that populations with a Low intake of dietary Sodium have a Low prevalence of i blood pressure. i blood pressure is seen mainly in societies with a salt intake 6g per day. Modest reduction in salt intake for people on a typical western diet results in a blood pressure drop of 5. 3/3. 7mmHg in hypertensive patients and 1. 9/1. 1mmHg in normotensives. Were salt intake to be reduced over many years, the population benefi ts would be substantial. The recommended intake is 6g/day salt. The UK has led the way in reducing the salt content of food through public health programmes and engagement with food manufacturers. The major challenge for consumers is to be aware of the amount of hidden salt in food. New labelling will hopefully go some way to help them to identify healthier food options. Endothelial dysfunction and nitric oxide i blood pressure is associated with impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation of the vessel wall. A number of factors infl uence endothelial function: Nitric oxide (NO): NO l relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Released by endothelium in response to shear stress (i. e. Blood fl ow). Endogenous NO synthase (eNOS) l continuous normal basal release. Inducible iNOS l High concentrations of NO in response to infl ammatory cytokines. d NO has been reported in hypertensive patients ( their offspring). Oxidative stress: free radicals scavenge NO, forming potentially toxic by-products. Radicals themselves (such as superoxide, O ) are potent 2 vasoconstrictors. Prostaglandins: prostacyclin (PGI ) is released by endothelial cells in 2 response to shear stress and has a synergistic effect on tone with NO. Angiotensin II: a vasoconstrictor, also contributes to free radical generation and to endothelin release. Endothelins: potent vasoconstrictors, opposing the actions of NO. Also cause renal sodium retention, i aldosterone, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, cardiac hypertrophy, and fi brosis. Their role in the pathogenesis of i blood pressure is unclear. 454 CHAPTER 6 Hypertension Pathogenesis: genetics, arterial stiffness, and SNS Genetics Inheritance is not Mendelian. No one gene is responsible. Larger collaborative studies are providing information on susceptibility genes. Blood Hypertension levels are similar amongst close relatives (even those with normal range blood pressure), suggesting alleles on several different genes may have an effect on blood pressure. Rare monogenic causes of i blood pressure have been identifi ed, using linkage analysis in affected families (see Box 6. 1). Defects in these genes may also be important in e ssential hypertension (gene defects coding the B and G subunits of the epithelial sodium channel (linked to Liddle s syndrome) are associated with blood pressure variations in the general population). Research focus has been on likely culprit genes (esp. the angiotensinogen gene) and is now looking at genome-wide associations.",

Stiff arteries are less able to dampen a surge in Hypertension during systole, so systolic Hypertension is higher. A stiffer artery will also conduct a pulse wave more rapidly.

Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) There has been considerable recent interest in the role of the SNS in i blood pressure, with the development of techniques to reduce sympathetic activity. These include renal denervation with radiofrequency energy and baroreceptor activation therapy ( b p. 514). Activation of the SNS is clearly linked with acute i blood pressure chronic activation may have a role in the genesis of long-term i blood pressure in those with a genetic predisposition. SNS activation causes: i in stroke volume (via A -1 and -2 receptors). i in Heart rate (via B -1 receptors). i in systemic vascular resistance (via A -1 receptors).

Granular cells in the juxtaglomerular apparatus synthesize and release renin. Renin converts inactive angiotensinogen into angiotensin I, which, in turn, is converted by ACE in the lungs to active angiotensin II (A2). A2 binds two receptors AT-1 and -2 (b p. 510). Renin release is mediated by: d afferent arteriolar (i. e. renal perfusion) Hypertension of any cause. Sympathetic nervous system activation (granular cell B -1 receptors). d sodium delivery to the distal tubule (sensed by the macula densa). Prostacyclin, ACTH. Causes of i renin Sympathetic stimulation. Renal artery stenosis. Renal cell carcinoma. Benign reninoma (very rare). Other renin-secreting malignancies (also very rare). Many antihypertensives, including CCBs and diuretics. 2 Many patients with essential hypertension have i plasma renin levels not related to any of the listed causes, nor of any therapeutic relevance. Angiotensin Circulating A2 binds vascular receptors, but locally released A2 works at tissue level in a paracrine fashion. Tissue concentrations do not correlate with systemic levels but may correlate better with disease pathogenesis. Actions of angiotensin II Arteriolar vasoconstriction (and venular constriction to a lesser extent). Efferent renal arteriolar vasoconstriction. Aldosterone secretion. Adrenaline (epinephrine) release. Smooth muscle hypertrophy. Increased reabsorption of Sodium in PCT. Inhibits renin release (negative feedback loop).

The role of AT-2 receptors remains unclear, but ligand binding may regulate vasodilator, proliferative, and apoptotic effects of A2. PATHOGENESIS: renal artery stenosis AND OTHER FACTORS 457 Aldosterone Aldosterone synthesis occurs mainly in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex and is tightly regulated by the renal artery stenosis and electrolyte homeostasis ( i potassium or d sodium intake l aldosterone synthesis). Aldosterone acts at the collecting duct to promote sodium retention and potassium excretion ( b p. 930). Cortisol a lso activates the mineralocorticoid receptor so aldosterone-sensitive tissues contain High levels of 11 B -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (converts cortisol l cortisone, which is incapable of activating the receptor), protecting the mineralocorticoid receptor from states of High circulating cortisol. Extrarenal actions of aldosterone Paracrine action in non-epithelial tissues (brain, Heart, epithelium). Associated with vascular infl ammation and cardiac fi brosis. The same may be true in non-vascular tissues. Activates pro-fi brotic and growth factors in several tissues (including the Kidney). Other factors There is much redundancy in the control of blood pressure. Many neuroendocrine systems contribute to it in overlapping and interlocking ways a nd any (or all) of these may lead to abnormal blood pressure. Insulin resistance has a clear relationship with i blood pressure: Fasting insulin and glucose levels correlate with blood pressure in insulin-resistant patients. Relatives of those with i blood pressure are more likely to have insulin resistance. Insulin resistance predicts the subsequent development of i blood pressure. Mechanisms may include SNS activation and sodium retention. Natriuretic peptides, including: ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide). Released by atrial tissue in response to stretch, i. e. volume overload.

However, environmental concerns about mercury contamination have led to its gradual disappearance from clinical practice. Substitutes (aneroid sphygmanometers or oscillometric automated devices) are now preferred. Semi-automated devices may not measure blood pressure accurately in some clinical conditions, e. g. atrial fi brillation. Palpate the radial/brachial pulse before measuring, and, if irregular, measure blood pressure, using a manual device. Validation and maintenance are vital: for a list of approved apparatus, see M for British Hypertension Society or M for American Heart Association. Examiners technique is vital 1 Even a relatively small error in blood pressure measurement could result in inappropriate underor overtreatment. Standing blood pressure should be recorded, esp. during the initial assessment of elderly or diabetic patients. Measure in both arms. If there is a signifi cant difference (20mmHg), then repeat. Measure subsequently in the arm with the higher value. Place cuff 1 2cm above the antecubital fossa. Select appropriate cuff size. Cuff bladder width should be 40% and length 80% of arm. The standard adult bladder is 12 x 26cm (although some consider 12 x 35cm standard). Cuff too large l underestimation. Cuff too small l overestimation. Infl ate cuff whilst palpating the radial artery to estimate SBP. Infl ate cuff to 30mmHg above estimated SBP. Defl ate at 2mmHg/s, listening to Korotkoff phase I (appearance) for SBP and phase V (disappearance) for DBP. If phase V goes to zero, use phase IV (muffl ing). Take two measurements 1 2min apart, and read to the nearest 2mmHg (round off upwards). Document the time of measurement in relation to tablets. Do not round up or down to preconceived values (observer s prejudice). Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) Now recommended in the UK by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for the diagnosis of i blood pressure (daytime). Daytime ambulatory blood pressure correlates better with target organ damage (TOD) than clinic blood pressure and provides a more accurate diagnosis of i blood pressure. Day, night, and 24-hour blood pressure measurements are recorded and are usually lower than clinic measurements (see Table 6. 1 and Fig. 6. 3). The patient should refrain from strenuous exercise and straightening their arm during measurement (tricky if driving) and should keep a concomitant diary, e. g. sleep times. For an accurate result, two measurements per hour during the day, with a blood pressure MEASUREMENT 459 minimum of 14 measurements, are required. Several limitations, including cost, lack of outcome data for patients already on treatment, and acceptability to patients, still limit use. Indications for ABPM If clinic blood pressure is 140/90mmHg or higher. Possible white coat effect or white coat hypertension. Resistant i blood pressure. When blood pressure unusually variable.

Non-dipping, or reverse dipping, is associated with increased CV mortality and TOD. Masked i blood pressure: normal clinic blood pressure but elevated ABPM. Associated with higher prevalence of TOD. 460 CHAPTER 6 Hypertension White coat hypertension: elevated clinic blood pressure, with normal ABPM and no evidence of TOD. Increased prevalence with i age, milder hypertension (10 30% grade 1, 10% grades 2 and 3). Associated with increased CV risk. In hypertensive patients, known as white coat effect . Target ABPM for treated patients is 135/85 aged under 80, 145/85 aged over 80. Home Can be used as an alternative to ABPM for the diagnosis of i blood pressure. When confi rming hypertension using home blood pressure Take two consecutive measurements for each blood pressure recording, at least 1min apart. Record blood pressure twice daily (morning and evening). Take readings for at least 4 days (ideally, 7 days). Discard the fi rst day s measurements. Use the average value of all the remaining measurements. When treating hypertension using home blood pressure Management of blood pressure, according to home measurements, in individuals already receiving treatment is not backed by robust evidence. Home blood pressure monitors are often inaccurate. The British Hypertension Society has a list of validated machines on their website (M http: // www. bhsoc. org ). Patients are more likely to reach target blood pressure with home blood pressure monitoring but will need the same number of tablets to do so. It can be very helpful to involve patients in their own management. Helpful in those with white coat effect where the target blood pressure is: Aged below 80 135/85mmHg. Aged over 80 145/85mmHg. Blood Hypertension variability A recent series of analyses have recently been published, showing that excessive variability in blood pressure is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Variability in SBP is a strong predictor of stroke (independent of mean SBP). In treated i blood pressure, this variability is associated with a higher risk of vascular events. blood pressure variability is measured as the standard deviation of mean blood pressure. Not clear if causation, or marker, of vascular disease. The different classes of antihypertensive agent vary in their capacity to infl uence this blood pressure variability. CCBs and thiazide-like diuretics are the most effective at reducing variability. Older and black patients are more likely to have i SBP variability. blood pressure MEASUREMENT 461 462 CHAPTER 6 Hypertension Clinical assessment There are four fundamental questions to consider: Is this sustained hypertension? Is this primary or secondary hypertension? Are there other cardiovascular risk factors? Is there target organ disease? Management of an individual patient will depend on these factors.

Lowering blood pressure with drugs is recommended when total CV risk is High because of TOD, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease, even for grade 1 i blood pressure Initiation of drug treatment should also be considered for grade 1 patients at Low to moderate risk when blood pressure is within this range at several repeated visits, or elevated by ambulatory blood pressure criteria - and remains within this range despite a reasonable period of lifestyle measures. CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT THRESHOLDS 467 Drug treatment is recommended in elderly patients (age 60) when SBP is ≥160mmHg. However, treatment should also be considered in this group (esp. if age 80) if SBP is in the 150160mmHg range, provided that it is well tolerated. This recommendation in the elderly is an important change from previous ESH-ESC guidelines. A High normal blood pressure should not be treated with antihypertensive drug therapy. Young individuals with isolated elevation of brachial SBP should not be treated (due to a lack of evidence), but should be followed closely with appropriate lifestyle recommendations.",

However, it is expected that JNC 8 (or JNC late as it has been dubbed) may, like ESH-ESC, offer a more stringent interpretation of available data retaining a goal of 140/90mmHg for the majority, but suggesting higher targets may be acceptable for many patients age 60 (and particularly age 80). JNC 8 may also echo ESH-ESC by offering a more circumspect view of lower treatment targets (130/80mmHg) in the presence of comorbidities such as Diabetes and chronic kidney disease. The current status is available at: M guidelines/hypertension/jnc8/ Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Recommend a blood pressure target 140/90mmHg for non-diabetic, nonproteinuric chronic kidney disease patients Target 130/80mmHg if proteinuria (30mg/24h) whether diabetic or not. Tailor treatment regimes for individual elderly patients by carefully considering age, co-morbidities and other therapies. Escalate treatment carefully under appropriate supervision. X The J-curve phenomenon The question how Low to go? remains both valid and important. It is possible that there may be a threshold below which additional blood pressure reduction is no longer benefi cial. This could be explained by the maintenance of physiological autoregulation within organ vascular beds, particularly in the presence of CV disease. The data supporting a lower the better approach have come from meta-analyses of multiple trials, rather than from studies specifi cally designed to scrutinize different target ranges. Indeed, some trials, such as ACCORD, have shown no consistent reduction in CV events, even when lower average SBPs are achieved. Furthermore, it has been inferred from some studies; e. g. ONTARGET that lower blood pressure targets may actually be associated with additional coronary events. Many interpret the J-curve relationship to mean that blood pressure reduction to lower levels, even if not harmful, is certainly less meaningful than a reduction to more moderate values.",

    "text": "These issues are refl ected in the latest iterations of the guidelines discussed above, which have become more guarded in their recommendation of lower targets, even in High-risk groups. Overall, current evidence suggests that, even if escalating therapy to achieve the lowest possible blood pressure is not clearly detrimental, neither is it clearly advantageousit may not be cost effective, with patients unnecessarily exposed to side effects that infl uence their overall compliance. CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT THRESHOLDS 469 Suggested indications for specialist referral Urgent (inpatient) treatment needed: Accelerated hypertension (severe i blood pressure, with grades III IV retinopathy). Particularly severe hypertension (220/120mmHg). Hypertensive emergency (e. g. encephalopathy, eclampsia, aortic dissection). Impending complications (e. g. LVF, TIA). Possible s hypertension. Resistance to treatment ( ≥ 3 drugs). Multiple drug intolerances. Multiple drug contraindications. Persistent non-adherence or non-compliance. Other situations: Unusual Blood Hypertension variability. Possible white coat hypertension. Hypertension in pregnancy. 470 CHAPTER 6 Hypertension Cardiovascular risk assessment Formal assessment of CV risk is the starting point for treatment decisions and discussions between clinicians and patients. The ultimate goal of the treatment of hypertension is prevention of CV disease. The absolute risk of a CV event varies widely according to age, sex, severity of blood pressure, and presence or absence of additional risk factors. The relative risk reduction of interventions is constant. Overprediction l overtreatment, underprediction l missed opportunity. Estimation of risk is straightforward in many patients; e. g. those with established CV disease, Diabetes, chronic kidney disease or a signifi cantly elevated single risk factor. In these situations CV risk is High and aggressive intervention highly desirable. Many patients, however, do not belong to such High-risk groups and estimation of risk requires the use of risk-prediction models. Many computerized models have been developed. None are perfect. They aim to identify patients for intervention and calculate potential risk reduction. Many are based on Framingham data. However, Framingham studied a Caucasian, middle class population on no treatment (i. e. no aspirin, statins etc. ) and is several decades old. See www. framinghamheartstudy. org/risk Framingham-based scoring tends to overestimate CV risk in Low and medium risk groups and underestimate CV risk in renal disease, Diabetes, certain ethnic groups, those with LVH and those with family history of premature CHD. It has been suggested that the risk score should be adjusted by a factor of x 1. 5 if there is one relative with premature cardiovascular disease and by x 1. 4 if the individual is a male of South Asian origin. Many models refer to 10-year risk of CV mortality. High risk refers to 10-year CV mortality of ≥20%. The Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) model has been developed from large European cohort studies. It allows calibration for several different countries and is recommended by ESH-ESC. An interactive version of SCORE is available through www. heartscore. org. ASSIGN (www. assign-score. com) is based on Scottish data and takes family history and social deprivation into account. There is a move toward estimations of lifetime rather than 10-year risk. For example, the QRISK lifetime risk calculator identifi es younger patients with High lifetime risk (defi ned as 50%) who would not be identifi ed using 10-year risk estimates. (www. qrisk. org). The prediction of lifetime risk is recommended by the Joint British Societies (see Risk calculators may not be appropriate when individuals are at higher CV risk because of underlying medical conditions/treatments (e. g. HIV, autoimmune disease). Clinical judgement is important when making decisions in certain circumstances (e. g. obesity, taking statins, already on blood pressure treatment, recently stopped smoking).",

CARDIOVASCULAR RISK ASSESSMENT 471 When you dont need a risk calculator: Assume the following groups of people are at High risk (10-year cardiovascular disease risk ≥ 20%), rather than use risk calculators: Pre-existing cardiovascular disease. diabetes mellitus. chronic kidney disease. Familial hypercholesterolaemia. 472 CHAPTER 6 Hypertension Lifestyle measures Lifestyle changes can d blood pressure, reduce drug requirements, and improve CV risk (see Table 6. 5). The effects are synergistic. Clear advice, including culturally appropriate written and audiovisual material, should be provided to all patients as well as to those with a High normal (pre-hypertensive) blood pressure or positive family history. Low-Sodium diet Reduces blood pressure in normotensive and hypertensive populations. Enhances response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker treatment. Usual sodium intake is in the range 150 200mmol/day (8 12g/day). Reduce by as much as possible; at least 100mmol/day ( 7 2. 3g of sodium or 6g NaCl). The majority (80%) of salt is hidden (breads, stock cubes, ready meals, breakfast cereals, sauces). Avoid salt in cooking and on the table. Cook using natural ingredients. Dietary Sodium can be estimated by 24h Urine sodium (aim 100mmol/24h). If necessary, refer to a dietitian. Note: 1g of sodium contains 44meq, 1g of NaCl contains 17meq of sodium; 5g of NaCl 7 1 teaspoon. Patients should be advised that, with time, their taste sensitivity to salt will increase if they undertake a restriction. 1 Low sodium salt substitutes often contain potassium as KCl and can cause dangerous hyperkalaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease and those taking potassium -sparing diuretics. Weight loss Obesity (body mass index ≥ 30) is fuelling the increasing incidence of i blood pressure and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Weight reduction improves blood pressure, even without dietary sodium restriction, and has benefi cial effects on insulin resistance, lipids, LVH, and diabetic control. Healthy eating Advise a diet High in fruit and vegetables (fi ve portions/day), Low in saturated fats, Low in total and saturated fats. The Dietary Approach to Hypertension Trial (DASH) demonstrated impressive reductions in blood pressure. The DASH eating plan can be downloaded at: M gov/health/public/Heart/hbp/dash. potassium, magnesium 2, and Ca2 supplementation is not recommended. Exercise Exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of diabetes mellitus and decrease blood pressure by up to 10mmHg. 2 Think FITT (Frequency (5 x /week), Intensity (moderate, mildly SOB), Time (at least 30min), Type (any aerobic). Isometric and strenuous exercise tends to i blood pressure and is best avoided until blood pressure is under control. Alcohol There is a linear relationship between C H OH consumption and blood pressure, with the incidence of i blood pressure increasing 7 1. 5 2. 0 2 x 5 at 2 drinks/day. It is also associated with drug resistance. Patients will, no doubt, remind you of the apparent paradox that moderate alcohol intake reduces overall CV risk; LIFESTYLE MEASURES 473 however, recommended daily amounts should not be exceeded (: 21 units/week; : 14 units/week). The effect of C H OH is reversible; d alcohol intake by 3 units/day ld need for medicat 2 ion 5 (in 7 1 6 weeks). Caffeine Caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonist (l vasoconstriction). 5 cups coffee/day is undesirable. It causes an immediate increase in SBP by 7 10 15mmHg for several hours. Caffeine is also present in tea and cola drinks, although coffee only has been studied. Recommend decaffeinated alternatives.",

Disorders of autonomous aldosterone secretion with suppressed renin account for 7 0. 1% of the hypertensive population (possibly an underestimate, some say 1 5%) and is the most common endocrine disorder leading to s hypertension. It is also associated with i CV risk beyond that expected by the level of blood pressure alone. Clinical and biochemical fi ndings vary widely. Often asymptomatic but may present with d potassium , metabolic alkalosis, and mild i sodium (helps distinguish from essential blood pressure treated with diuretics where sodium is usually Low normal). However, d d potassium with diuretics (3. 0mmol/L) remains suspicious. Severe d potassium l tetany, myopathy, and nephrogenic Diabetes insipidus (polyuria and nocturia). Causes Conn s syndrome (aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma) 7 70%. Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia 7 30%. Aldosterone-producing adrenal carcinoma ( i i aldosterone and d d potassium may also produce cortisol and sex steroids). Primary (unilateral) adrenal hyperplasia. Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism. Diagnosis d potassium is only present in 50 80% early on (leading to underdiagnosis). Renal potassium wasting (urinary potassium 30mmol/day). Aldosterone renin ratio (ARR): Commonly used diagnostic test (see Box 6. 2). Unregulated aldosterone secretion l suppressed renin production and i ARR. Note i blood pressure in the malignant phase often has electrolyte abnormalities similar to primary hyperaldosteronism, i. e. d potassium, i HCO . ARR is not 3 interpretable at this stage so should not be done in this acute setting. There is no gold standard test for p hyperaldosteronism. Confi rmatory tests include: Oral or IV salt loading: High sodium diet for 3 days (200mmol/day ask your dietitian) or IV normal saline (2L over 4h). Verify with urinary sodium 250mmol/24h. Measure 24h urinary aldosterone. Normal response: suppressed aldosterone secretion ( l lack of suppression confi rms diagnosis). 1 May precipitate d potassium ; supplement with slow-release KCl. Fludrocortisone suppression test: 4-day administration of fl udrocortisone further suppresses plasma renin activity without suppressing plasma aldosterone below a threshold value. PRIMARY HYPERALDOSTERONISM 477 A captopril challenge test fails to suppress aldosterone 30% in primary hyperaldosteronism. Adrenal computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are used to localize tumours ( 1. 5cm). 1 Never order imaging before confi rming secretion. Never assume a radiologically apparent adrenal adenoma confi rms the laterality of secretions if planning adrenalectomy. Adrenal venous sampling is occasionally necessary the distinction between a discrete adenoma and diffuse hyperplasia is important because of the potential role of surgery in the former. General principles of treatment Spironolactone (a competitive antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, b p. 501), initially 50 100mg (SE: gynaecomastia, impotence, menstrual irregularities, GI upset).

Autosomal dominant. A chimeric aldosterone synthase/ 11 B -hydroxylase is ectopically expressed in the adrenal fasciculata. ACTH l stimulates enzyme activity l normal cortisol production aldosterone excess ( l volume expansion and i blood pressure). Presents with i blood pressure at a young age, with a family history (early haemorrhagic stroke in some pedigrees). Diagnosis (see Fig. 6. 5) now confi rmed with genetic testing. Dexamethasone l suppresses ACTH secretion l d enzyme activity l d aldosterone production. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) Inherited enzymatic defects (autosomal recessive) in cortisol production. Clinical features depend on the enzyme affected but result from: (i) d cortisol synthesis, (ii) i ACTH-driven steroid production. Two forms (of six) are associated with mineralocorticoid excess and 6 i blood pressure: 11 B -hydroxylase (CYP11B1) defi ciency, presenting in childhood; are virilized, and are sexually precocious. 17 A -hydroxylase (CYP17) defi ciency. Extremely rare. Presents with i blood pressure, d potassium , and hypogonadism often at puberty. Secondary hyperaldosteronism Occurs when aldosterone hypersecretion results from i circulating renin levels often in response to renal hypoperfusion. i renin l i circulating A2, i peripheral resistance, and i blood pressure (often severe). Associated s hyperaldosteronism l i tubular sodium reabsorption ( 6 d potassium ). Causes include: Renal artery stenosis. Renal infarction, e. g. atheroemboli.

Crucially, both renin and aldosterone are suppressed. Causes include: Apparent mineralocorticoid excess. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Liquorice ingestion. Ectopic ACTH secretion. Exogenous mineralocorticoids, e. g. fl udrocortisone. Apparent mineralocorticoid excess 1% hypertensives. Autosomal recessive, presenting in childhood. Inactivating mutation in 11B -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11 BH SD2). The mineralocorticoid receptor (which has an equal affi nity for cortisol and aldosterone) is protected from ongoing cortisol stimulation by 11 B HSD2, which metabolizes cortisol l cortisone (relatively inactive). As cortisol is present at 100-fold concentrations, compared to aldosterone, absence/inhibition of this enzyme allows cortisol to fl ood the receptor l chronic activation. Diagnosis i ratio of urinary tetrahydrocortisol (THF 5A THF) (metabolite of cortisol) to tetrahydrocortisone (THE) (metabolite of cortisone). Management Block the mineralocorticoid receptor (spironolactone) or suppress ACTH secretion (dexamethasone suppresses endogenous cortisol synthesis but does not activate the mineralocorticoid receptor). Liquorice contains glycyrrhizinic acid, which can bind the 11B HSD2 enzyme, creating a state of apparent mineralocorticoid excess. Most commercial liquorice preparations in the UK do not contain large amounts, but continental or traditional preparations are stronger (and often are combined with salt! ). Also look out for it in herbal preparations. Pseudoaldosteronism Caused by abnormalities of renal tubular transport, rather than elevated renin or aldosterone. The electrolyte abnormalities mimic those seen with i aldosterone, hence the name ( b p. 800). Causes include: Liddle s syndrome. Bartter s syndrome (normotensive). Gitelman s syndrome (normotensive). OTHER HYPERALDOSTERONISM SYNDROMES 481 482 CHAPTER 6 Hypertension Other causes of secondary hypertension Cushings syndrome Prevalence in hypertensive populations estimated at 0. 5 1%. i blood pressure is very common, affecting 7 80%. Look for typical phenotype, and exclude exogenous glucocorticoids. 24h urinary cortisol excretion is a reliable diagnostic test ( 110nmol/day is highly suggestive). Diagnosis confi rmed by a 2-day Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (0. 5mg every 6h for eight doses; a cortisol drawn 4 6h after the last dose should be 140nmol/L) or an overnight suppression test (1mg at 23. 00; cortisol should suppress to 50mmol/L). Measurement of serum ACTH concentrations, a long dexamethasone suppression test ± corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation test and adrenal/pituitary imaging will help to distinguish different forms of the syndrome (Cushing s disease most common: pituitary overproduction of ACTH). Phaeochromocytoma Adenoma (rarely carcinoma) of adrenal medulla l oversecretion of catecholamines (adrenaline l i heart rate and contractility; noradrenaline l i SVR). Can also arise in extra-adrenal chromaffi n tissue (e. g. para-aortic ganglia). Very rare ( 0. 1% hypertensives). Consider if: Severe sustained and/or paroxysmal i blood pressure refractory to therapy.

Medial and neointimal thickening causes a shelf-like structure to extend into the aortic lumen just distal to the left subclavian artery. Often asymptomatic, may be diagnosed after CV examination; midsystolic murmur, radiofemoral delay, i blood pressure (arms legs), or CXR (aortic 3 sign from preand post-stenotic dilatation and posterior rib notching). If undetected in childhood, presents with cardiac failure in middle age and with a worse prognosis. D iagnosis: computed tomography, MRA, or aortography. Treatment: surgical. blood pressure correction is age-dependent ( 90% in childhood). Drug-induced hypertension See b p. 474. Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) The number of diagnosed and treated patients with OSA is rising rapidly. i blood pressure is commonly associated. Often treatment-resistant and associated with a lack of nocturnal dipping on ABPM. Assess for daytime somnolence (see Box 6. 4). treatment/prescription: treatment of the OSA improves blood pressure. Weight reduction, alcohol avoidance, correction of airway obstruction, oral prosthetic devices, overnight non-invasive ventilation, CPAP, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty.

    "text": "UK physicians prescribe fewer combination pills than anywhere else in Europe. Compliance improved by once-a-day formulations and by clearly explaining the benefi ts and potential side effects of drug treatment. Although marked interindividual variation in drug responses refl ects the heterogeneity of the pathogenesis of i blood pressure, profi ling patients, according to their hypertensive phenotype with a view to individualizing drug therapy, has proved diffi cult (exceptions: the elderly and ethnic groups). Drug withdrawal might be possible if other lifestyle interventions are undertaken and prove successful. The patient may benefi t from joining local or national forums (e. g. M ). Once blood pressure is adequately controlled, provide at least an annual review for monitoring. The major drug groups are equally well tolerated. They are prescribed in 7 equal amounts in primary care: Thiazide diuretics (b p. 498). angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and ARBs (b p. 508511). Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) ( b p. 506). B -blockers ( b p. 502). In the UK, B -blockers have been downgraded and are not recommended as fi rst-line therapy. However, it largely depends on which guideline you follow. A -blockers are not recommended as fi rst line (b p. 504). X The optimal cardiovascular outcome is most consistently linked with the level of blood pressure control, rather than the class of drug used to achieve it. In general, the lower the blood pressure, the better. Patients will be accruing benefi t, even if they do not achieve target blood pressure. There are now generic versions of key medications, which has reduced the cost of choosing many drugs. It is helpful to consider compelling indications and compelling contraindications (see Table 6. 8). There are also other less defi nite pros and cons that will be assigned different importance by different prescribers. Timing of therapy may be important. If more than one agent is used, then having at least one dose at bedtime may improve circadian blood pressure, CV outcomes, and daytime blood pressure control (this has been demonstrated for both non-chronic kidney disease and chronic kidney disease populations in recent RCTs). DRUG MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION 485 Aspirin and statins Consider prescribing other drugs that modify CV risk. Aspirin 75mg od: p prevention in hypertensives aged 50 and 10-year CV risk 20% and blood pressure 150/90mmHg, with no contraindication. s prevention of CV disease. Statin therapy: p prevention in hypertensives with 10-year CV risk 20%. s prevention in all with overt CV disease, irrespective of baseline total cholesterol or LDL. Targets: d total cholesterol by 25% or LDL cholesterol by 30%, or achieve a total cholesterol of 4. 0mmol/L or LDL cholesterol of 2. 0mmol/L (whichever is the greatest reduction). 486 CHAPTER 6 Hypertension sgurd evisnetrepyhitna fo sessalc rojam eht rof snoituac dna, snoitacidniartnoc, snoitacidni elbissop dna gnillepmoC 8.",

The British Hypertensive Society and NICE Two key UK advisory bodies published updated guidelines in 2011 on the treatment of hypertension (see Fig. 6. 6). In the 2006 guidelines, B -blockers were downgraded in response to evidence suggesting they may be less effective at d major CV events (particularly stroke) than other drug classes and that they have a higher Diabetes risk than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or CCBs (particularly in patients also taking a thiazide diuretic ( b p. 502)). In this recent update, there has been a change in the priority of medications in people 55 years, with calcium channel blocker as the fi rst-line choice, based on event reduction and cost effectiveness. Thiazide-like diuretics (e. g. indapamide) are suggested in those with Heart failure or very elderly who are intolerant of a calcium channel blocker. B -blockers can still be used as possible fi rst-line therapy in of childbearing potential and patients with evidence of i sympathetic drive. Renin profi ling demonstrates that younger people (55 years) and Caucasians have higher renin levels, refl ecting an active renal artery stenosis, relative to elderly and black patients. Since angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and ARBs act through renal artery stenosis suppression, they are recommended as initial therapy in younger Caucasian patients. Recommendations (see algorithm in Fig. 6. 6) Step 1: People aged 55: initial therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/Low-cost angiotensin receptor blocker. People aged 55: initial therapy with a calcium channel blocker. Black patients (any age): calcium channel blocker (does not include mixed race, subcontinental Indian, or Chinese patients).",

Step 2: Add angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (or Low-cost angiotensin receptor blocker) to calcium channel blocker (or vice versa). Step 3: Before considering step 3 treatment, ensure step 2 treatment is at optimal, or best tolerated, dose. Compelling indications/contraindications should be taken into account ( b p. 486). Recommendations in other guidelines The ESH-ESC guideline advocates the initiation of a drug combination in High-risk patients or in those with a signifi cantly elevated presenting blood pressure. It is thought that JNC 8 will take a similar view. In these circumstances, combined therapy should offer a greater potential for achieving target blood pressure reduction and with fewer side effects than when maximizing the dose of a single agent (see Fig. 6. 7).

This holds true in the UK, with mortality data for England and Wales showing mortality 3. 5 x the national average. British Asians have a mortality rate 1. 5 x the national average. There is evidence of differential blood pressure-lowering effi cacy of particular drugs within ethnic groups, although the variability is greater within the groups than between them. The recommendation of calcium channel blocker in this group is based on greater treatment effects, compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker. If not tolerated, diuretic therapy is useful, as there is a higher prevalence of salt-sensitive i blood pressure and increased salt and Water retention likely to contribute to the increased i blood pressure.",

    "text": "Black patients, in general, have a lower renin, and so agents (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, and B -blockers) that suppress renin production may not be as effective, especially when used as monotherapy. The International Society of Hypertension in black people (M ) has made recommendations for treatment and favour the initiation of combination therapy in individuals with more signifi cant hypertension. Hypertension in the elderly CHD and stroke remain the major killers in those aged 65, with blood pressure the commonest treatable risk factor. SBP increases with age. DBP increases to age 60, plateaus, and then falls. This leads to an age-related increase in pulse Hypertension and isolated SBP. blood pressure variability also increases 6 more measurements are desirable prior to treatment. Using a relatively conservative defi nition of i blood pressure ( ≥ 160/95mmHg), it is estimated that 15% of the 12 million people aged 60 in the UK are hypertensive ( 70% aged ≥ 80). i blood pressure in the elderly is 6 a major public health issue. Clinical trials have shown that older people benefi t just as much, if not more, from intervention as younger patients. A study of those ≥ 80 years (Hypertension in the Very Elderly (HYVET), with target blood pressure 150/80mmHg, showed overwhelming CV benefi ts from treatment. 1 This needs to be balanced against the risk of orthostatic hypertension ( l falls l fractures). You may need to titrate treatment to the standing blood pressure value, and DBP should not be reduced to 65mmHg. Low renin hypertension is the norm, so begin treatment with a thiazide or calcium channel blocker. For second line, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/ARBs are demonstrably more effective than B -blockers. Other lifestyle interventions still apply. Hypertension in Diabetes mellitus (See b p. 612. ) Hypertension in chronic kidney disease (See b pp. 2034. ) Hypertension in pregnancy (See b p. 846. ) blood pressure TREATMENT: SPECIAL SITUATIONS 491 Oral contraceptives, HRT, and blood pressure Oral contraceptives The combined oral contraceptive (COC) modestly i blood pressure in a minority of women ( 7 1%). Occasionally, elevations may be severe. The rise in blood pressure may not become apparent for several months, or even years, after COC introduction. The mechanism(s) of i blood pressure remain uncertain, and it has proved diffi cult to identify women at particular risk. COC use is also associated with increased stroke and myocardial infarction risk. blood pressure should be measured prior to COC use and at least every 6 months thereafter. Progestogen-only pills have not been associated with i blood pressure and are recommended for women with both COC-induced i blood pressure and pre-existing i blood pressure. In those women wishing to remain on the COC, antihypertensive medication should be given early consideration. For older women (aged 35) with higher CV risk (e. g. smokers), non-hormonal forms of contraception are preferable. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) HRT use is not associated with i blood pressure, and its use is not contraindicated in pre-existing hypertensives. Several large randomized trials have established that the CV protection afforded by HRT has been overplayed previously and should not be used as the motivation for their prescription. 492 CHAPTER 6 Hypertension Clinical trials in hypertension The benefi ts of blood pressure lowering are supported by one of the most authoritative evidence bases in clinical medicine.

    "text": "Endpoints: All-cause mortality. Cause specifi c morbidity and mortality (usually CHD ± stroke; more recently, CCF). The composite p endpoint has emerged (i. e. a combination of events) because trials seldom have suffi cient power to examine specifi c outcomes. Early trials compared active therapy with placebo, often among patients with severe i blood pressure. Consequently, they had High power and could be conducted on a relatively small scale. Such trials became unethical, as the benefi ts of blood pressure lowering became apparent. Modern head-to-head trials tend to assess whether drug classes offer advantages over others (drug companies are desperate to demonstrate benefi ts beyond blood pressure lowering ). blood pressure differences between treatment arms now tend to be minimal, 6 d study power and necessitating i patient numbers. Contemporary treatment objectives also infl uence trial design most patients now require multiple drugs to achieve target. The majority of patients at High CV risk will be receiving concomitant treatment with aspirin ± a statin, further diminishing study power. Trials are hugely expensive. The data from clinical trials are often pooled for meta-analysis. This can provide increased power to examine drug-specifi c effects. See Table 6. 9 for recent major trials. X Controversies Do specifi c classes of drugs offer benefi ts for CV disease prevention beyond the expected benefi ts of blood pressure lowering? There are marked drug-specifi c differences in their effect on CV structure and function as well as metabolic endpoints. The relevance of these effects on longer-term outcomes remains unknown. Could certain classes of drugs be potentially harmful with regard to specifi c outcomes? With regard to study design, can treatment be solely measured in terms of CV events or is the real aim to prevent the evolution of a destructive disease process? Clinical trials rarely run for more than 5 years, while life expectancy in middle-aged hypertensives is 20 30 years. CLINICAL TRIALS IN HYPERTENSION 493 Meta-analysis of blood pressure-lowering trials: the BPLTTC The Blood Hypertension Lowering Treatment Trialists Collaborative (BPLTTC) was formed over 10 years ago and is an international alliance of the principal investigators of the largest trials of antihypertensive regimens. The project is based at the George Institute for International Health, a department of the University of Sydney (M ). Its objective is to address questions concerning safety and outcome with specifi c drug classes. To achieve this, data from recent trials are pooled and subjected to meta-analysis ( 6 providing the necessary statistical power to examine drug-specifi c effects). Analysis includes differential drug effects in Diabetes, between the sexes, and for the risk of major CV effects. Analysis published in 2003, incorporated data from 29 randomized controlled trials involving 7 160, 000 patients, with a mean duration of follow-up of 2. 0 8. 0 years ( 70, 000 patient years). The mean age was 65 years (52% , 48% ). Conclusions Treatment with any of the commonly used regimens d the total risk of major CV events. Larger reductions in blood pressure produce larger reductions in risk. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and diuretics ± B -blockers are more effective at preventing Heart failure than regimens based on CCBs. Other differences in regimens beyond blood pressure lowering are less certain (including for stroke). Turubull F et al. (2003) L ancet 362: 1527 1535. 494 CHAPTER 6 Hypertension Table 6.",

Effi cacy depends on active secretion of the diuretic into the proximal nephron so that High concentrations are achieved at sites of action along the tubule. Renal insuffi ciency impairs proximal secretion l relative diuretic resistance. Higher doses may still be effective but risk i toxicity. The sodium and volume loss associated with diuretics is initially accompanied by the activation of vasoconstrictor mechanisms (including renal artery stenosis). This is one of the reasons that diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/ARBs are a Good combination (see Fig. 6. 8). Thiazide-type diuretic Examples Thiazides: bendrofl umethiazide, hydrochlorothiazide. Thiazide-like: chlortalidone, indapamide. Mechanism Compete with both sodium and chloride to block the sodium chloride co-transporter in the DCT (normally responsible for 5 7% of fi ltered sodium reabsorption). i sodium delivery to distal nephron l i sodium /potassium exchange and, indirectly, i H excretion. Hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis often results. Blocking the sodium chloride co-transporter li Ca2 reabsorption. There are a number of potential mechanisms for this, but the relative contributions are unknown. It is most likely that chronic volume depletion leads to more proximal reabsorption. Thiazides 6 have a role in prevention of renal stone disease and exert a protective effect in osteoporosis. Thiazide-like agents differ in several of their actions, including duration of action, channel-blocking activity, and inhibitory infl uence on carbonic anhydrase. Role Effective, Good evidence base, and inexpensive. Introduced in 1957 and still the fi rst line in several guidelines. Evidence for bendrofl umethiazide comes from studies with higher doses than those used in clinical practice now. For this reason, thiazide-like agents are now considered fi rst choice over thiazides. i plasma half-life and sustained renal actions make them preferable to loop diuretics as antihypertensives (except in special situations, b p. 500). Problems Hypokalaemia (dose-dependent). Impaired glucose tolerance (especially when used with a B -blocker). Small i in LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Small i serum urate.

    "text": "500 CHAPTER 6 Hypertension Diuretics 2 Loop diuretics Examples Furosemide, bumetanide. Mechanism Block the type 2 sodium potassium 2Cl (NKCC2) co-transporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (usually responsible for 15 20% of fi ltered sodium reabsorption). Tubuloglomerular feedback would normally act to compensate by a d in glomerular filtration rate, but this is dependent on an identical ( 6 inhibited) co-transporter in the macula densa. Like thiazide diuretics, may cause hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis. Initial sodium and volume loss may be compensated for by sodium retention during the latter part of the dosing interval, with amelioration of blood pressure-lowering effi cacy. So, more frequent dosing (at least twice daily) is necessary when used for treatment of hypertension. Role More potent natriuretics than thiazide-type diuretics but less effective blood pressure-lowering agents. Their place in the management of i blood pressure is limited to patients with CCF (with volume overload), renal impairment (with volume overload), and other oedematous states (e. g. cirrhosis). Sequential nephron blockade This is a strategy to overcome diuretic resistance in oedematous states that involves combination therapy with loop and thiazide (or thiazide-like) diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics Examples Amiloride, triamterene. Mechanism Block the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) expressed in the late DCT and collecting duct. ENaC plays a central role in the control of urinary sodium reabsorption, ECF volume homeostasis, and blood pressure regulation. Several hormones, including aldosterone, vasopressin, angiotensin II, insulin, and endothelin, regulate ENaC activity. potassium absorption is tightly coupled with ENaC sodium absorption. Drugs blocking ENaC 6 cause potassium retention. Also has Mg2 -sparing effects. Role Not fi rst-line. Useful adjuncts to limit d potassium and d Mg2 with other diuretics. d potassium may actually i blood pressure and is associated with insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, arrhythmias, and sudden death. DIURETICS 2 501 Amiloride may be used to prevent d potassium and i blood pressure associated with excess glucocorticoids or mineralocorticoids ( b p. 477) and in Liddle s syndrome (caused by activating mutation(s) in ENaC) ( b p. 801). Can be useful in black patients where ENaC may play a more prominent role. Can be useful in patients with suspected hyperaldosteronism who are avoiding spironolactone/eplerenone before ARR testing. Problems 1 Hyperkalaemia! Cautions: renal impairment (especially in diabetes mellitus), combination with B - blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, or spironolactone. The incidence of i potassium when amiloride is co-prescribed with a thiazide or loop diuretic is very Low. Mineralocorticoid antagonists Increasingly recommended as the fourth-line agent for resistant hypertension. Why is this? Aldosterone activates mineralocorticoid receptors in the Heart, vasculature, and brain. Adverse consequences of activation include endothelial dysfunction, myocardial fi brosis, myocyte hypertrophy, vascular injury, and centrally mediated elevations in blood pressure. renal artery stenosis activation is associated with worse outcomes in patients with CCF and i blood pressure. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and ARBs d aldosterone production, levels return toward normal with chronic use. Plasma aldosterone levels correlate with LVH in hypertensive patients. Patients with p hyperaldosteronism have worse CV outcomes. Pharmacological blockade of mineralocorticoid receptors d LVH and microalbuminuria in hypertensive patients. Experience in severe CCF is positive, with a d in mortality (RALES study). Spironolactone has long been used in the treatment of conditions associated with s hyperaldosteronism and volume expansion, such as cirrhotic ascites. Spironolactone and eplerenone are the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in clinical use. Spironolactone is recommended as fi rst line on effi cacy and cost grounds. Highly effective. It can be used in combination with thiazide-like diuretics.",

When glomerular fi ltration Hypertension is dependent on A2-driven efferent arteriolar tone (e. g. volume depletion, renal artery stenosis, CCF), then ACE inhibition may cause a precipitous decline in glomerular filtration rate. 1 Precautions: Ensure patient is volume-replete. Check UE and estimated glomerular filtration rate before commencing treatment and 5 7 days after. Expect (and allow) a rise in serum creatinine. Stop angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor if change in creatinine ≥ 30% or d estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≥ 25%. Ask those on diuretic therapy to take fi rst dose before retiring to bed. Seek specialist help if High index of suspicion of renovascular disease ( b p. 586). 2 Counsel patients that they should avoid NSAIDs and temporarily stop taking their angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in the event of an intercurrent illness, e. g. febrile illness, diarrhoea, Vomiting. They should inform their doctor in this circumstance. Hypotension. Acute falls in blood pressure with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor occur when renal artery stenosis is activated, e. g. overdiuresis, CCF, accelerated hypertension. Rare when therapy initiated in uncomplicated hypertensive patients (admission to hospital for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor introduction was commonplace in the 1980s). Postural hypotension is actually comparatively uncommon. In elderly or frail, consider starting at night. Hyperkalaemia. Most common in those with renal impairment 9 other drugs causing i potassium (e. g. amiloride, spironolactone, B -blockers). Patients who develop mild i potassium should not necessarily have their angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor stopped, particularly if there is a compelling indication. Dietary advice is usually suffi cient to allow re-introduction. Many specialists will tolerate i potassium 6. 0mmol/L. Cough. Common (5 40%, ) and generally resistant to all measures, except drug withdrawal ( i bradykinin 9 other vasoactive peptides, e. g. substance P l cough refl ex activation). Angioneurotic oedema. Rare.

Mechanism There are two A2 receptor subtypes: AT mediates: (i) vasoconstrictor effects of A2 and (ii) A2-induced 1 growth in the myocardium and arterial wall. AT function is less well understood. Expressed at High levels in 2 fetal tissues, with d expression after birth. Probably responsible for many of the proliferative effects of A2. angiotensin receptor blocker l inhibition of AT l inhibition of vasoconstrictive action of A2 1 on smooth muscle. Two major differences between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor l d activity of A2 at both AT and AT receptors. angiotensin receptor blocker only 1 2 d AT activity, with no effect on AT. 1 2 ACE is a kininase, so angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lead to i kinins. Kinins are responsible for some angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor side effects (esp. cough) but may also mediate some of their benefi cial effects, including blood pressure lowering and i insulin sensitivity. A2 blockade leads to i renin, i angiotensin I, and i A2, although this accumulation does not appear to overwhelm receptor blockade. Roles Similar blood pressure-lowering effect to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and other main classes. As with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, synergistic with diuretics. ARBs have similar benefi ts to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in conditions other than i blood pressure, such as CCF (Val-HeFT and CHARM studies) and post-myocardial infarction (VALIANT).",

Angio-oedema has been reported. Cause not clear. Altered taste. Contraindicated in pregnancy. Concerns regarding increased cancer risk led to an FDA analysis, but no overall increase in cancer was found. Practical points Not all ARBs are the same. Losartan and valsartan are relatively short-acting. Give twice daily if blood pressure not controlled. Generic preparations mean that cost has reduced. Check salt intake if resistant to treatment. Some studies suggest increased insulin sensitivity but not conclusive. Losartan has a mild uricosuric effect, which may be benefi cial in patients with gout. A2 RECEPTOR BLOCKERS (angiotensin receptor blocker) 511 Combined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and ARBs (see also b p. 614) Two drugs are not better than one Good theoretical rationale for using in combination: ACE inhibitors do not completely block the formation of A2 (other tissue proteases are involved). ARBs are selective for the AT receptor, leaving AT receptor 1 2 exposed to i A2. With angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, i A2 l renin release, eventually returning A2 towards baseline (termed A2 escape ). Combination therapy is effective in LV dysfunction (Val-HeFT and CHARM studies). Small studies (e. g. CALM) raised expectation. One key study (COOPERATE) was retracted after publication. ON-TARGET, a large RCT comparing the effects of telmisartan, ramipril, and their combination on CV mortality in High-risk patients found the combination was not associated with an improvement in key outcomes but increased the risk of renal failure. Current guidelines do not recommend the use of combination therapy for the treatment of hypertension. Renin inhibitors Direct renin inhibition provides an additional means of antagonizing renal artery stenosis. Aliskiren was the fi rst commercially available example. Lowers blood pressure to a similar degree to other agents. Anticipated that it might have a useful synergistic role in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (as renin increases with long-term use of these agents). In the ALTITUDE study, 8, 600 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy were assigned to either aliskiren or placebo to take, in addition to their pre-existing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker. The trial was stopped early, as there were no apparent CV or renal benefi ts, but there was a higher adverse event rate ( i potassium, d blood pressure, stroke). 1 MHRA/FDA now advise not to use aliskiren in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and ARBs in patients with Diabetes or renal impairment. They may still have a role in patients with High renin i blood pressure that is inadequately treated despite maximum therapy or multiple drug intolerances. Side effects: i potassium , d blood pressure, angio-oedema, GI symptoms, raised uric acid ( l gout, renal calculi). Do not use in pregnancy. Important interaction with ciclosporin ( l i Blood levels of aliskiren) 6 avoid this combination. 512 CHAPTER 6 Hypertension Other antihypertensive agents With the exception of methyldopa and moxonidine, these drugs are rarely seen in the routine treatment of i blood pressure in the UK. However, they are still widely used around the world and generic formulations mean lower costs in many instances.

OTHER ANTIHYPERTENSIVE AGENTS 513 Antihypertensives on the horizon Endothelin antagonists The endothelins are a group of potent vasoconstrictor peptides produced in many different tissues. ET-1 is the predominant endothelin secreted by the endothelium where it acts in a paracrine fashion. Several antagonists are under investigation, and it is hoped they will prove renoand cardioprotective as well as antihypertensive. Darusentan, a marginally selective ET receptor antagonist, has been A shown to reduce blood pressure and proteinuria in early studies (e. g. DORADO). Bosentan is already licensed for use in pulmonary hypertension. Vasopeptidase inhibitors (VPIs) Simultaneously inhibit both ACE (preventing the conversion of AI l A2) and neutral endopeptidase, The latter is a membrane-bound metalloprotease involved in the enzymatic degradation of natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP) and various other peptides, so inhibition will prolong their duration of action. The combined effect of reduced A2 activity and increased natriuretic peptide activity is attractive. Early studies with VPIs showed a very favourable therapeutic effect. However, a signifi cant incidence of potentially life-threatening angio-oedema ultimately led to failed FDA approval and stalled development. Angiotensin receptor blockers with neutral endopeptidase inhibition (ARNi) Currently being evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies. Preliminary results suggest increased blood pressure reduction in comparison to angiotensin receptor blocker alone and with no increase in angio-oedema. 514 CHAPTER 6 Hypertension Non-pharmacological strategies Introduction It is important not to forget (and to often revisit) dietary salt restriction, reduced alcohol intake, weight loss, and patient education. There has also been growing recent interest in novel, often invasive, therapies, particularly in the management of resistant hypertension. These include: Renal denervation with radiofrequency energy It has been known for years that interruption of the renal nerves can lead to a reduction in blood pressure.",

Procedure-related adverse events relatively common. 516 CHAPTER 6 Hypertension Resistant hypertension Introduction Variably defi ned but usually a failure to reach target blood pressure despite multiple antihypertensive agents, including a diuretic. It is most commonly a consequence of poorly controlled SBP. Although thought to be relatively common u p to 20 30% of study populations in clinical trials the experience, when recruiting to these studies, has been that true resistant hypertension is actually less common if drug therapy is optimized and contributing factors are rectifi ed. In the UK, resistant hypertension is considered to be blood pressure not controlled to target with maximal recommended and tolerated doses of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/ angiotensin receptor blocker calcium channel blocker thiazide. The 2011 BHS/NICE guideline recommends that such patients are managed with a further diuretic (consider spironolactone), an Ablocker, or a B -blocker (and that a referral for specialist input is considered). Although evidence for treatment strategies are generally limited, more robust guidance will hopefully emerge in the next few years; for example, the BHS PATHWAY 2 study has been designed to evaluate whether resistant hypertension is due to excess Sodium retention and whether further diuretic is the most effective treatment. The study also hopes to determine whether plasma renin can be a useful guide to further treatment in this circumstance.",

Emergencies: severe i blood pressure complicated by evidence of acute or progressive organ dysfunction, such as cardiac ischaemia, encephalopathy, stroke, pulmonary oedema, or renal failure. Urgencies: severe i blood pressure without evidence of acute or progressive target organ dysfunction. The term malignant hypertension was coined before antihypertensive therapy improved an appalling prognosis (1-year mortality 7 90%). It is a syndrome of i blood pressure with progressive target organ damage and papilloedema. Pathologically, arteriolar fi brinoid necrosis is the characteristic lesion. Accelerated hypertension was applied to the scenario of retinal haemorrhages and exudates without papilloedema. The distinction from malignant hypertension is unhelpful, as both carry an identical prognosis. There is no threshold of blood pressure above which malignant hypertension develops. DBP ranges from 100 180mmHg, SBP 150 290mmHg. 2 Severity is not determined by blood pressure alone it is the clinical context and degree of target organ dysfunction. Affects 1% of the hypertensive population, but the hypertensive population is large. . Essential hypertension accounts for 7 2 30% of episodes in Caucasians but 7 80% in black patients ( 2 therefore, usually avoidable). Renal disease (intrinsic and renovascular) accounts for the majority of the rest. Other previously unrecognized forms of secondary i blood pressure may also be responsible. The duration of hypertension prior to the development of malignant phase may range from days to years. Pathophysiology Vascular autoregulation Autoregulation describes the ability of organs to maintain their perfusion, regardless of blood pressure. i blood pressure causes distal arteriolar vasoconstriction, protecting end-organs from hypertensive mechanical stress. Hypertensive emergencies are associated with a failure of this process, resulting in transmission of i blood pressure to the microvasculature where mechanical trauma l endothelial injury l i vascular permeability l leakage l platelet and fi brin deposition l fi brinoid necrosis. Catecholamines and vasopressin release also contribute. Endocrine and paracrine mediators, including renal artery stenosis, are activated with i A2, leading to further vasoconstriction and ischaemia.",

Neurological: headache (60%), dizziness (30%), neurological defi cit, e. g. hemiparesis, cortical blindness ( 10%). Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), also known as reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), is increasingly recognized. PRES is characterized by headache, confusion, seizures, visual loss, and areas of cerebral oedema on magnetic resonance imaging. The syndrome tends to resolve with treatment of blood pressure, although visual defects may persist. Renal: acute kidney injury (30%).",

Dose 0. 25 1. 5 micrograms/kg/min, with increase of 0. 5 micrograms/kg/min every 5min until adequate response. 1 Associated with cyanide toxicity (prevent by protecting drug from light; risk increased at 2 micrograms/kg/min and in renal failure). Labetalol (combined A - and B -blocker) particularly logical in IHD and aortic dissection. 20mg IV initially over 1min, followed by infusion 0. 5 2mg/min. Safe in pregnancy. Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) 2 10mg/h. Useful with symptomatic coronary artery disease or acute LVF. 1 Care if volume-depleted. Tachyphylaxis occurs after 24 48h. Once blood pressure within target range, transfer to oral agent, and wean IV infusion over 4 8h. 2 Treatment when no life-threatening organ damage May have features of malignant hypertension with TOD but not life-threatening. Aim d diastolic blood pressure to 110 115mmHg over 24 48h. Oral agents preferred. Low Blood volume may manifest after treatment initiated (l postural drop of 20mmHg suggests hypovolaemia in need of correction). Start with slow-release nifedipine, e. g. nifedipine retard/MR 10mg. Repeat the same dose at 2h intervals, with maintenance doses of 20mg 3 x day. 1 Do not use capsules or LA preparations.

HE, periodic acid Schiff (PAS), Jones (silver) stains). Useful for morphology, chronicity, and diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry: usually by immunofl uorescence but also immunoperoxidase staining. Localizes immune reactants (particularly immunoglobulins or complement fractions) within glomeruli, using fl uorescein-labelled antibodies. The nature and pattern of staining are characteristic for particular glomerular lesions. Electron microscopy (EM): useful for examining cell and basement membrane structure and for characterizing glomerular deposits. The language of glomerular disease When examining a preparation of renal cortex, several glomeruli (10 30, on average) are sampled. The following descriptive terms (see Fig. 7. 2) are then used: Focal or diffuse? Focal lesions affect some (50%) of sampled glomeruli, but not all. Diffuse lesions involve most (50%) glomeruli, if not all. Segmental or global? Segmental lesions affect part of an affected glomerulus. Global lesions involve most of the glomerular tuft. Proliferative or not? Proliferative lesions describe an increase in local cell number; for instance, an increase in mesangial cells ( mesangial proliferative ) is a feature of IgA nephropathy. Crescentic or not? Glomerular parietal epithelial cells (lining Bowman s capsule) proliferate in response to local infl ammatory and procoagulant signals, with fi brin deposition and adhesions fi lling some, or all, of Bowman s space ( l crescent ). Matrix or membrane? Expansion of matrix produced by mesangial cells, as seen in IgA nephropathy, or increase in GBM width (and thus capillary wall thickness) characteristic of immune deposits.",

Membranous Specifi c type of glomerular basement membrane thickening associated with subepithelial immune deposits, e. g. idiopathic membranous nephropathy. Hyalinosis Accumulation and condensation of plasma proteins into tissues outside a Blood vessel lumen, appears as homogeneous pink staining with HE (see HE later in table). Sclerosis Scar tissue, a fi brous matrix obliterates normal structure so that capillaries collapse and normal cell nuclei are lost. Tubular atrophy Thickening and wrinkling of tubular basement membrane around a shrunken tubule with fl attened epithelium; implies irreversible tubular damage. Crescent Collection of cells in Bowmans space in response to glomerular damage. Initially only composed of infl ammatory and epithelial cells (cellular crescent), later organizes with fi brin and collagen (fi brous crescent). Diffuse Applying to all glomeruli in a biopsy. Focal Applying to some glomeruli, but not others. Global Applying to the whole of a glomerulus. Segmental Applying to part of a glomerulus, i. e. part of the glomerular capillary tuft is unaffected.

Presents (often rapidly) as: Haematuria and proteinuria. Impaired renal function. Oliguria with signs of salt and Water retention. It is a spectrum of disease with a variety of aetiologies but with a common site of primary injury: the glomerulus. Onset may be insidious, with urinary abnormalities alone, or fulminant, with a rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis, acute kidney injury, and other organ involvement or failure ( b p. 71). Causes IgA nephropathy and Henoch Sch ö nlein purpura. Lupus nephritis. Post-infectious glomerulonephritis. Anti-GBM disease. ANCA-associated vasculitis. Mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis (MCGN). Mechanisms of glomerular injury The injury leading to most glomerulonephritis is immunologically mediated, with loss of tolerance to autoantigens, provoking both the cellular and humoral arms of the immune system. These antigens may be native to the glomerulus itself (occurring normally within the tuft, e. g. the GBM in anti-GBM disease) or circulating antigens/antigen-antibody complexes that become trapped in glomerular structures. Antibody to antigen binding may then fi x and activate complement (forming immune complexes, ICs) or recruit infl ammatory cells (see Fig. 7. 3). The nature of the injury will depend on the site of the IC (e. g. IgA-containing mesangial complexes activate mesangial cells to cause IgA nephropathy). Local complement activation and cell recruitment (neutrophils, macrophages) generate oxidant species, proteases, infl ammatory cytokines, growth factors, vasoactive factors, and procoagulants. Damage to, and activation of, surrounding cells and matrix then lead to the changes evident on histological examination and the clinical syndrome of haematuria, proteinuria, and impairment of glomerular fi ltration. The number of ICs formed and the host response to them will determine the extent of the injury. Cellular immunity may also contribute to structural glomerular damage this is especially true of pauci-immune glomerulonephritis (e. g. the glomerulonephritis associated with ANCA-positive vasculitis) where ICs play no pathological role. Resolution of infl ammation might return an infl amed glomerulus to normal or, if the healing phase is poorly regulated, may result in cellular dropout, scarring, glomerulosclerosis, and chronic kidney disease.

Consider baseline and interval DEXA if long-term steroids. Treat steroid-exacerbated hyperlipidaemia with a statin. Tapering steroids Prednisolone is the most widely used oral corticosteroid. Its use in renal disease is usually for 3 weeks and it will therefore often require slow tapering to allow recovery of a suppressed hypothalamic pituitary axis.

Protecting against gonadal cyclophosphamide toxicity Glomerular disease, particularly SLE, often affects of childbearing age. Cyclophosphamide (CYC) treatment is associated with a signifi cant risk of premature ovarian failure (POF). This may play an important role in the choice of induction therapy but must be balanced against the risks of potential undertreatment.

In small observational studies, the administration of GnRH analogues during treatment with CYC for lupus nephritis demonstrably preserves ovarian function. An example regimen is depot leuprolide acetate, ideally administered at least 10 days prior to the commencement of CYC.

Often presents with haematuria in the 2nd and 3rd decades. Usually idiopathic, but IgA nephropathy is also found in association with Henoch Sch ö nlein purpura ( b p. 650), alcoholic cirrhosis, GI disorders (coeliac disease, infl ammatory bowel disease), and skin and joint disorders (spondyloarthropathies, dermatitis herpetiformis, psoriasis). (cid: 2) Previously considered relatively benign, it is now recognized that 30 50% will progress to signifi cant chronic kidney disease over time. The remainder will either enter remission or have persistent Low-grade haematuria/proteinuria Pathogenesis The majority of IgA (both IgA1 and 2) is produced by plasma cells and freely circulates before hepatic metabolism. In IgA nephropathy, abnormally glycosylated polymeric IgA1, with an increased tendency for self-aggregation and complex formation, is deposited in the glomerular mesangium. These deposits are seen in 3 16% of healthy individuals with no renal disease, suggesting that deposition of IgA alone is insuffi cient to induce injury. Co-deposits of IgG and C3 may contribute to severity. The predominance of IgA1 over IgA2 is due to the abnormal glycosylation of O-linked polysaccharides that are unique to the hinge region of IgA1. IgA binding of mesangial Fc receptors l mesangial cell activation l production of platelet-derived growth factor and other cytokines l mesangial cell proliferation, matrix synthesis, infl ammatory cells recruitment, and local injury (see Fig. 7. 4). Infection, particularly mucosal, and hypersensitivity are suggested precipitants. However, it seems likely that an aberrant IgA immune response is more important than a particular antigen, with polymeric IgA found in plasma cells. There is evidence of a genetic infl uence, but it is complex and polygenic and diffi cult to study, owing to the often latent nature of the disease. Symptoms and signs Often presents as asymptomatic urinary abnormalities, particularly microscopic haematuria. Haematuria may be macroscopic, classically timed with upper respiratory illnesses (so-called synpharyngetic haematuria ). Associated proteinuria is common, although nephrotic range proteinuria (3g/day) is unusual (15%). Consider in young adults presenting with urinary abnormalities 9 chronic kidney disease. i blood pressure is common and often diffi cult to control. 2 IgA nephropathy may present as a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with acute kidney injury ( b p. 71). Extrarenal manifestations, including a purpuric skin rash, can occur, and there appears to be overlap with Henoch Sch ö nlein purpura (HSP). For discussion, see b p. 651.

Classifi cation A lack of historical agreement concerning precise histological classifi cation has rendered trial data diffi cult to interpret and accord on best treatment diffi cult to reach. The 2009 Oxford Classifi cation was based on a consensus view of 265 biopsy specimens. The following variables were associated with renal outcome, independent of baseline features and control of blood pressure and urinary Protein excretion: Mesangial hypercellularity score. Segmental glomerulosclerosis. Endocapillary hypercellularity. Tubular atrophy/interstitial fi brosis. (One drawback is that the classifi cation does not include crescentic/ necrotic lesions. ) It is hoped that this classifi cation may help to stratify an individual patient s prognosis and determine their treatment at the time of biopsy (e. g. endocapillary proliferation may help to predict steroid responsiveness). 546 CHAPTER 7 Diseases of the Kidney IgA nephropathy: management Introduction The treatment of IgA nephropathy is unsatisfactory because of the heterogeneity of the disease itself and the paucity of Good clinical trial data. Prevention of progressive renal impairment is the key therapeutic goal. However, many patients have slowly progressive disease (decline in glomerular filtration rate of 7 1 3mL/min/ yr), so long-term studies are urgently required. Current options are broadly divided into non-immunosuppressive and immunosuppressive strategies. Stratifying patients: key features of a poor prognosis at presentation Impaired renal function. Heavy proteinuria (3g/day). (Diffi cult to control) hypertension. Signifi cant tubulointerstitial fi brosis and glomerulosclerosis on renal biopsy (see Oxford classifi cation, b p. 545). Rapidly progressive crescentic IgA nephropathy. Low-risk patients (no poor prognostic features) Normal glomerular filtration rate. Isolated microscopic, or episodic macroscopic, haematuria. Proteinuria 500mg/day (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 50mg/mmol). Normotensive. No specifi c treatment is necessary in this group, but regular surveillance (e. g. annual blood pressure, serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio) is recommended. X Many centres will manage these patients without a renal biopsy and, therefore, without a specifi c diagnosis of IgA nephropathy ( b p. 67). Persistent haematuria implies ongoing immune activity. Proteinuria implies more severe disease, and the amount will increase with activity and progression. Medium-risk patients (no poor prognostic features) Older age. Normal glomerular filtration rate or only slight d. Proteinuria 500mg/day (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 50mg/mmol). Hypertension. Non-immunosuppressive treatment 2 Reduce blood pressure and proteinuria. Aim for target blood pressure of ≤125/75mmHg, ideally with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor as fi rst agent (angiotensin receptor blocker if not tolerated). If normal blood pressure, but proteinuria, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for proteinuria reduction. X Dual blockade of A2, using combined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker, may offer additional benefi t ( d proteinuria but no data on renal outcomes). If tolerated, titrate therapy to reduce proteinuria to 1g/day (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 100mg/mmol) and ideally 0. 5g/day (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 50mg/mmol).

Common associations of post-infectious glomerulonephritis Bacterial: streptococcal, staphylococcal, pneumococcal, meningococcal, salmonella, mycobacterial, syphilis. Viruses: infl uenza B, mumps, rubella, coxsackie, hepatitis B, EBV, CMV. Fungi: candida, Coccidioides, Histoplasma. Parasites: malaria, fi liariasis, toxoplasmosis, or schistosomiasis. Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis Introduction An immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis that usually occurs in childhood (age 7 years). Now rare in developed countries. Classically, follows 10 21 days after a streptococcal sore throat but often occurs after infection elsewhere, e. g. tonsillitis, pharyngitis (commonly), impetigo, otitis media, and cellulitis. Pathophysiology Infection with nephritogenic Lancefi eld group A B -haemolytic Streptococcus (esp. types 12 and 49) is followed by a latent period during which immune complexes form, circulate, and then deposit in glomeruli. Nephritis-associated plasmin receptor (NAPIr) and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SPE-B) are two suggested culpable antigens. Clinical presentation Varies from asymptomatic microscopic haematuria through to an acute nephritic syndrome, with frank haematuria, oliguria, oedema, i blood pressure, pulmonary oedema, and acute kidney injury. Bilateral loin Pain or renal angle tenderness s renal engorgement may occur. Investigations Urinalysis. Urine microscopy for red cell casts 9 pyuria. serum creatinine, UE, FBC, Ca2 , LFT. urine protein-to-creatinine ratio. Anti-streptolysin O titre (ASOT) or anti-DNase B (for group A streptococci) may be positive.

A renal biopsy is rarely necessary, unless resolution does not begin within 1 week. In adults, main differentials are IgA nephropathy, MCGN, SLE, HSP, and other vasculitides. A biopsy is more likely to be undertaken to confi rm the diagnosis. Histology Diffuse proliferative changes with hypercellularity. Extensive neutrophilic infi ltration and red cell casts. Crescentic change and frank necroses are unusual. Immunofl uorescence: IgG and C3 deposition in diffuse granular pattern in both the mesangium and glomerular capillary walls. EM: dome-shaped , electron-dense deposits in the subepithelial aspects of the capillary walls, with endothelial cell Edema. Similar to the changes seen in MCGN (for graphic, see b p. 551). Clinical course Generally, PIGN is self-limiting once (if) the underlying infection resolves. It is associated with a full renal recovery (even after acute kidney injury). Resolution usually begins after 7 1 0 days. Recurrence is rare. Urinary abnormalities may persist for many years after recovery, although isolated microscopic haematuria has little prognostic value. Proteinuria, i blood pressure, and chronic kidney disease also occur, so patients should be offered follow-up. Treatment 2 Ensure the predisposing infection has resolved. If ongoing, treat actively with a penicillin or other appropriate antibiotic.

Shunt nephritis Originally coined to describe the glomerulonephritis associated with a chronically infected ventriculoatrial or ventriculojugular shunt used to treat hydrocephalus. In the modern European Renal Association, bacterial biofi lms on an indwelling central venous cannula or cardiac pacing apparatus are more likely to be the source of Low-grade infection (l immune complex formation and glomerular deposition). Clinical features in such scenarios include: Fever. Haematuria, proteinuria, and i serum creatinine. Splenomegaly. i ESR, CRP, d hemoglobin, and d C3. Histology is similar to PIGN.

It carries a relatively poor prognosis: 7 50% end-stage renal disease at 10 years. Symptoms and signs All may present as asymptomatic urinary abnormalities, acute nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, or progressive renal failure. i blood pressure is particularly common. For presentation of cryoglobulinaemia, see b p. 634. MCGN type II may be associated with partial lipodystrophy (absent subcutaneous issue in the face and upper limbs) and retinal abnormalities (pigmentation and visual fi eld defi cits). Investigations serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, UE, albumin, LFTs, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio), microscopy for red cell casts. 2 Consider potential underlying causes: immunoglobulins, serum and urinary Protein electrophoresis ( 9 serum free light chains), hepatitis serology (for HCV and MCGN, see b p. 686), rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulins, complement components, and C3 nephritic factor ( b p. 41). Complement in MCGN Type I MCGN: Classical pathway is activated by immune complexes l normal/ d C3 and d C4). Type II MCGN (dense deposit disease): Alternate pathway is activated ld C3, normal C4. A stabilizing IgG binding a C3 convertase (C3Bb) occurs in dense deposit disease l persistent cleavage of C3. This is termed the C3 nephritic factor. Type III MCGN: Findings similar to type II but without the C3 nephritic factor. Management 2 Exclude s causes of MCGN prior to treatment. For treatment of HCV-related MCGN, see b p. 688. (cid: 2) Evidence-based treatment strategies are lacking for primary MCGN. Many early studies almost certainly (inadvertently) included patients with s MCGN.

MCGN: towards a new classifi cation Until recently, MCGN was generally classifi ed as described on b p. 550; i. e. either p (idiopathic) or s if an underlying cause could be identifi ed. p MCGN was further classifi ed into IIII based on ultrastructural appearances and distribution of electron-dense deposits. More recently, a better understanding of the pathogenetic role of complement in MCGN has informed a new view of the lesion, with categorisation into either Ig-mediated disease (driven by the classical complement pathway) or non-Ig-mediated disease (driven by the alternative complement pathway) (see Fig. 7. 6). The non-Ig-mediated group, referred to as C3 glomerulopathy, includes dense deposit disease and C3 glomerulonephritis. C3 glomerulopathy is a proliferative lesion, usually with a MCGN-type appearance on light microscopy. C3 alone on immunostaining suggests overactivity of the alternative complement pathway. Historically, clinical trials within MCGN have selected patients with comparable histology on light microscopy meaning that many different etiologies were probably represented. It is hoped that advances in clinicopathological understanding will foster diagnostic clarity and generate disease-specifi c therapies.

The classifi cation may also be usefully extended to other forms of proliferative glomerulonephritis, even if they do not have an MCGN pattern on light microscopy. An Ig-mediated glomerulonephritis should prompt an investigation into infectious, malignant, or autoimmune causes (immune-complex formation). A glomerulonephritis with C3 staining alone suggests overactivity of the alternative complement pathway; i. e. a complement-mediated glomerulonephritis. Such diseases, including C3GN and Dense Deposit Disease, have been termed C3 glomerulopathies and should suggest investigation of the alternative complement pathway (e. g. functional assays, genetic mutation analysis, and autoantibody screening).

The syndrome arises as a result of a failure of the glomerular fi ltration barrier to restrict the passage of proteins into Bowman s space. It implies structural abnormalities within the glomerular fi lter. Primer: the glomerular fi lter (see b p. 916) Comprises: Charged endothelial cell glycocalyx layer. Endothelium and its fenestrations. The glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Interdigitating podocytes that form a slit diaphragm. The passage of albumin, with its net negative charge, through the glomerular fi lter is prevented by size-specifi c factors (e. g. the slit diaphragm) and charge-specifi c factors (e. g. the anionic endothelial glycocalyx and GBM). Any albumin that escapes into Bowman s space is effi ciently reabsorbed in the proximal tubule via receptor-mediated endocytosis. It is then degraded and returned to the circulation as peptide fragments. Many primary and secondary causes of the nephrotic syndrome are now thought to be due to abnormalities of, or injury to, podocytes and the slit diaphragm ( podocytopathies ). How does proteinuria cause the clinical syndrome? The cause of hypoalbuminaemia is not as straightforward as one might think.",

    "text": "How does proteinuria cause the clinical syndrome? The cause of hypoalbuminaemia is not as straightforward as one might think. The Liver is actually capable of synthesizing 25g albumin/ day: much higher than urinary losses. Potential explanations: Larger quantities of albumin pass through the glomerular fi lter but are reabsorbed and catabolized within the renal tubules (i. e. the degree of proteinuria underestimates Protein losses). Other circulating factors alter the production of albumin by the Liver in response to Protein losses. Hypoalbuminaemia itself is not usually severe enough to directly explain the profound oedema of the nephrotic syndrome.

Diuretics: a loop diuretic, such as furosemide, e. g. 40mg/day PO, increasing, as necessary, to 250mg daily. In massive oedema, IV diuretics may be required to overcome impaired oral drug absorption ( s to gut oedema). Many clinicians use IV furosemide in combination with salt-poor albumin (e. g. 50 100mg furosemide in 100mL 20% human albumin solution over 1h) to augment natriuresis and diuresis; however, the enhanced effect may simply be due to volume expansion. Add-on thiazide-type diuretics (e. g. metolazone 2. 5 5mg PO od) may help to promote diuresis through a synergistic effect with High-dose loop diuretics ( (cid: 2) requires regular (often daily) measurement of sodium and potassium to prevent profound electrolyte imbalances use with caution, especially in an outpatient setting).

THE NEPHROTIC SYNDROME: GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES 557 Flank Pain and haematuria suggest renal vein thrombosis (b p. 590). Prophylactic anticoagulation with SC heparin (and sometimes warfarin) in High-risk patients ( b p. 892). Formally anticoagulate those with proven DVT or thromboembolic episode. Treat for the duration of the nephrotic syndrome; aim INR 2 3. Infection Low IgG levels predispose to infection. Treat infections promptly, with appropriate cover for polysaccharide encapsulated organisms: S trep pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus infl uenzae, Salmonella typhi, Cryptocoocus neoformans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mnemonic: Some Nasty Killers Have Some Capsule Protection). Offer persistently nephrotic patients vaccination against pneumococcal disease. Infection may also complicate immune suppressive treatment of the nephrotic syndrome ( b p. 540). Dyslipidaemia Nephrotic syndrome l i hepatic synthesis and d catabolism of LDL cholesterol (possibly in response to d plasma oncotic Hypertension). Successful treatment of elevated LDL cholesterol may prevent CV morbidity and slow decline in renal function. Dietary restriction is usually insuffi cient and drug treatment with statins is often appropriate. Treatment of underlying nephrotic syndrome will lead to resolution of dyslipidaemia. 558 CHAPTER 7 Diseases of the Kidney Minimal change disease Introduction MCD is less common in adults (7 25% of cases of the nephrotic syndrome) than in children. It generally carries an excellent prognosis. The pathogenesis of minimal change nephropathy (MCD) is uncertain, but altered T lymphocyte activity and production of a glomerular permeability factor ( l podocyte dysfunction) are suspected. Albuminuria essentially results from a failure of the glomerular fi lter. Aetiology May be idiopathic ( p ) or s to: Drugs: NSAIDs (most common), antimicrobials, lithium, bisphosphonates, and penicillamine (many others). Cancer: haematological malignancies (most common), solid organ malignancies (rare: more commonly associated with membranous nephropathy). Infections (rarely): esp. TB, syphilis, HIV, mycoplasma, HCV. Atopy: 30% of MCD patients. Immunizations. Symptoms and signs Oedema, often massive, with facial and periorbital Edema, ascites, pleural and pericardial effusions. Proteinuria and, rarely, microscopic haematuria on urinalysis. Urine may be foamy (Protein has a detergent effect). Lipiduria may be visible on microscopy as fat bodies. May present with infections (esp. skin and soft tissue) or hypotension ( s to hypovolaemia). Abdominal Pain s to spontaneous peritonitis. Venous thrombosis (e. g. renal or deep vein). acute kidney injury ( s to ATI). Investigations serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, UE, d albumin, LFT, bone profi Blood, i cholesterol. urine protein-to-creatinine ratio or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (tests for selective proteinuria may be helpful) ( b p. 60). Urine microscopy (may show lipid bodies, hyaline or granular casts). Renal biopsy in adults. Histology Normal on light microscopy (hence minimal change ). Negative immunohistochemistry or immunofl uorescence. EM reveals diffuse effacement of podocyte foot processes. Treatment Symptomatic treatment, as outlined on b p. 556. MCD remits rapidly with corticosteroids therapy; 80 90% of adults will be in remission after 12 weeks of therapy. MINIMAL CHANGE DISEASE 559 Prednisolone 1mg/kg daily (to maximum of 80mg/day) until remission achieved. Taper prednisolone fortnightly, then weekly, until discontinued. 2 Ensure treatment is continued for at least 12 weeks at fi rst presentation to minimize risk of relapse. Taper slowly, e. g. over 6 months.",

First relapse and infrequent relapses should be treated as described earlier. If relapses are more frequent and respond quickly to steroids, then taper immediately on remission, aiming for a shorter course. Certain subgroups will be more diffi cult to treat. Recurrent relapses occur despite initial response to treatment. Frequent relapse is generally defi ned as two relapses inside 6 months. Relapse occurs during steroid treatment or within 2 weeks of steroid withdrawal ( steroid-dependent ). No response to steroids at all, i. e. no remission within 12 weeks of treatment ( steroid-resistant ). 2 In these situations, it is important to review the histology to ensure diagnosis is defi nitely MCD, rather than a potentially less steroid-responsive alternative, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (b p. 560). In some cases, this may necessitate a repeat Kidney biopsy to ensure that glomerular sampling has been adequate. See initiating immunosuppression ( b p. 540). Consider: Ciclosporin 3 5mg/kg/day in two divided doses for 12 months. (cid: 2) Monitor glomerular filtration rate carefully (5 1 creatinine-European Dialysis and Transplant Association glomerular filtration rate is the most accurate method for monitoring any subtle decline in glomerular filtration rate, e. g. annually) to avoid or limit ciclosporin nephrotoxicity. Tacrolimus 0. 05 0. 1mg/kg/day in divided doses is an alternative. CNIs can be cautiously tapered to the minimum dose required to sustain remission once this has been achieved for 3 months. Consider stopping therapy at 1 2 years. Cyclophosphamide 2 2. 5mg/kg/day for 8 12 weeks, then stop. If remission not achieved with one regimen, consider the other. CNIs may be preferred in of childbearing age. MMF has been used as a steroid-sparing agent in children, and small studies suggest modest benefi t in adults. Rituximab: several case reports suggest benefi t. Further clinical trials are awaited. 560 CHAPTER 7 Diseases of the Kidney Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) Background focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is used primarily as a histological description, but also to refer to a particular disease entity. 2° focal segmental glomerulosclerosis occurs in the context of glomerular damage and dropout in an already injured Kidney where haemodynamic stresses damage remaining nephrons (so-called hyperfi ltration injury ). 1° or idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis refers to a d e novo glomerulopathy, rather than the result of associated disease. Primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis Introduction (with an additional higher risk of progressive chronic kidney disease in ). It is 3 x more common in black patients (where p focal segmental glomerulosclerosis causes 7 2/3 of the nephrotic syndrome). Black patients are more likely to have mutations in the apolipoprotein L1 ( APOL1 ) gene. Cause remains uncertain, however podocyte injury with subsequent abnormal podocyte responses is characteristic of the disease. As p focal segmental glomerulosclerosis disease recurs after transplantation (often immediately), a circulating factor capable of disturbing glomerular permeability has been implicated in some patients. This has not yet been fully characterized, but candidates include the soluble form of the urokinase receptor (suPAR) and VEGF. Symptoms and signs Proteinuria (often very heavy); nephrotic syndrome 7 80%. Microscopic haematuria ( 7 50%). i blood pressure ( 7 40%). Impaired renal function ( 7 25% at presentation). Young black men presenting with heavy proteinuria (10g/day), profound hypoalbuminaemia (albumin 20g/L), and renal impairment tend to follow a more severe course, often resulting in end-stage renal disease.

Histology A focal (affecting some, but not all, glomeruli) and segmental (affecting part, but not all, of the glomerular tuft) process (see Fig. 7. 7). Mesangial matrix expansion, glomerular sclerosis, endocapillary hypercellularity (including foam cells) and hyalinosis (hyaline deposits in the permeable capillary wall) are all variably present. FOCAL AND SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS (focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) 561 No abnormalities may be apparent if the sample size is small, refl ecting the focal nature of the disease. Such cases may then be mislabelled as minimal change disease. Biopsies that include juxtaglomerular glomeruli from the corticomedullary junction (affected early in the course of the disease) have a greater chance of detecting sclerotic lesions. ATN and tubulointerstitial fi brosis are not uncommon. Immunostaining: no immune deposits, but IgM and C3 may be trapped in sclerotic lesions. EM: foot process effacement and podocyte degeneration. Sub-classifi cation Sub-classifi cation of both p and, to a lesser extent, s focal segmental glomerulosclerosis into several histological variants may have prognostic signifi cance: Classic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: the prototype. Cellular variant: at least one glomerulus has segmental endocapillary hypercellularity with capillary occlusion. Tip variant: at least one segmental sclerosis affects the outer tip of the glomerulus alongside the proximal tubule. Potentially more steroid-responsive with a better prognosis. Collapsing variant: collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is characterized by collapse and sclerosis of the entire glomerular tuft, with GBM wrinkling, cystic tubular changes, and interstitial fi brosis. There is no endocapillary proliferation. 2 Often due to HIVAN ( b p. 676), but occurs with other viral diseases (esp. parvovirus B19). Also described in other situations, e. g. following High-dose bisphosphonates. Collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis typically presents with torrential nephrotic syndrome and rapidly declining renal function. Perihilar variant: perihilar hyalinosis and sclerosis in 50% of the glomeruli with sclerotic lesions. Often seen with the hyperfi ltration injury of s focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Fig. 7. 7 focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: a segmental sclerosis in an affected tuft. 562 CHAPTER 7 Diseases of the Kidney Secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis A less specifi c histological fi nding, usually resulting from glomerular hyperfi ltration (an adaptive response to maintain glomerular filtration rate). Histologically, glomerulomegaly and perihilar sclerosis may be more prominent, with less marked podocyte hyperplasia and, on EM, less widespread foot process effacement. Secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis tends to present with less proteinuria and hypoalbuminaemia than the primary variant; however, progressive chronic kidney disease is relatively common. It is associated with the following conditions: Familial (see below). Infection (podocyte invasion): HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), parvovirus B19. Drugs (podocyte toxicity): Pamidronate, lithium, A interferon, and heroin. Congenital or acquired nephron mass reduction: Renal dysplasia, refl ux nephropathy, renovasular disease, partial or unilateral nephrectomy. Hyperfi ltration as part of a disease process: Morbid obesity, diabetic nephropathy, pre-eclampsia, sickle cell disease. Any cause of glomerular disease with progressive scarring: E. g. membranous glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, Alport syndrome, thrombotic microangiopathy, vasculitis. Inherited focal segmental glomerulosclerosis Genetic diseases may lead to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis through the mutation of genes responsible for podocyte differentiation and function. These provide useful insights into podocyte function and podocytopathies. However, genetic testing is unnecessary in adults, unless there is a family history, as mutations are found in a small minority only and do not infl uence treatment.

FOCAL AND SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS (focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) 563 focal segmental glomerulosclerosis management Overview Symptomatic treatment, as outlined on b p. 556. 2 For s focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, treat the underlying cause where possible. For p focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, the initiation of immune suppression is based on estimates of renal prognosis and likely response. For non-nephrotic proteinuria, symptomatic treatment and watchful waiting are generally advocated. Poor prognostic factors Severe proteinuria (e. g. 10g/day). Progressive chronic kidney disease. Interstitial fi brosis on histology. Black race. No response to treatment. Histology: presence of collapsing variant (Bad) or tip lesion (Good). If nephrotic, spontaneous remission is uncommon. Progression to end-stage renal disease in 7 50% at 5 years if untreated. Some have a more protracted course, with slow decline in Kidney function over decades. Disease-modifying treatment. 2 See initiation of immune suppression on b p. 540. Prednisolone 1mg/kg/day (max 80mg) (or alternate day 2mg/kg) for a minimum of 4 weeks. Continue, as tolerated, for 16 weeks or until remission is achieved. (cid: 2) focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is slow to respond, and shorter courses of steroids are unlikely to be of benefi t. If response, taper steroids to cessation over 6 months. Unlike minimal change, a degree of proteinuria often persists: remission may be complete (0. 3g/day urinary Protein serum albumin 35g/L normal renal function) or partial (3. 5g/day urinary Protein 50% reduction from peak stabilization of renal function). Expect complete or partial remission in 7 4060%. Those that relapse whilst on (tapering) steroids or 2 weeks after cessation (on x 2 occasions) are steroid-dependent , and those with no reduction in proteinuria at 16 weeks are steroid-resistant . In these groups: Continue Low-dose (0. 15mg/kg/day) prednisolone. Add ciclosporin 3 5mg/kg/day in two divided doses. Treat for 6 months. Aim for trough levels 125 2 25ng/mL. Consider measuring accurate isotopic glomerular filtration rate at baseline. If response (expect in 7 70%): continue for 12 months, then taper dose, and stop. Ciclosporin dependence, with relapse on drug withdrawal, is not uncommon. Tacrolimus 0. 1 0. 2mg/kg/day in two divided doses is an alternative, MMF or cyclophosphamide (both with corticosteroids) have been used in this situation but do not enjoy a robust evidence base. X Plasma exchange is sometimes used as adjunctive therapy in severe disease unresponsive to other measures, with the aim of removing a pathogenic circulating factor in some cases. Relapse after treatment is common. PEX is an important part of the treatment of recurrent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis post-transplantation ( b p. 418). 564 CHAPTER 7 Diseases of the Kidney Membranous nephropathy (membranous nephropathy) Introduction Membranous nephropathy (membranous nephropathy) is one of the commonest causes of the nephrotic syndrome worldwide, with a peak incidence in the 4th to 6th decades, 2 : 1 . May be idiopathic (IMN) (75%) or secondary (25%) ( b p. 565).

Most clinicians will wait for 6 months to see if spontaneous remission occurs, but treat earlier if severe, symptomatic nephrotic syndrome, or early decline in renal function. IDIOPATHIC membranous nephropathy: TREATMENT 567 Immune suppression Disease-modifying therapy: the aim of immunosuppression is to reduce proteinuria, spare renal function, and induce complete, or partial, remission. Achievement of either complete or partial remission, either spontaneously or after treatment, is associated with a much improved prognosis. 2 See initiation of immune suppression on b p. 540. Alternating monthly steroids and alkylating agents for 6 months the Ponticelli regimen : Month 1: IV methylprednisolone 1g x 3, then oral methylprednisolone (0. 5mg/kg/day) for the remainder of the month. Month 2: oral cyclophosphamide 2. 0mg/kg/day (or chlorambucil 0. 15 0. 2mg/kg/day). Month 3: repeat month 1. Month 4: repeat month 2. Month 5: repeat month 1. Month 6: repeat month 2. For practical reasons, many clinicians adapt this to a non-cyclical regimen, giving prednisolone 1mg/kg/day PO daily (max 60 magnesium) (with or without 3x pulses of IV methylprednisolone at the outset) cyclophosphamide 1. 5 2. 0mg/kg/day PO, tapering steroids against response. X Whilst this is common practice, it does not have the evidence base available for the cyclical regimen. Most clinicians are less familiar with chlorambucil so prefer to use cyclophosphamide. CNIs are an alternative, particularly where alkylating agents are undesirable (or have been unsuccessful).

Start at lower dose, and titrate up, as tolerated. (cid: 2) Watch glomerular filtration rate closely. CNI levels should be monitored, particularly during the initial stages. If no response, stop at 6 months. In those that respond, aim to reduce to the minimum dose that maintains remission, and continue for at least 12 months. MMF may have a role (in combination with steroids), but supporting evidence is currently lacking, and there appears to be a higher risk of relapse. Rituximab (e. g. 375mg/m2 weekly x 4 doses) has been used, with encouraging success in observational studies. Long-term follow-up is currently lacking, so relapse rates are unknown. Relapse Treat with the same regimen that was successful initially, although an alkylating agent should, in general, only be used once more. 568 CHAPTER 7 Diseases of the Kidney Hereditary nephropathies Alport syndrome Classically presents as a triad of: Family history of progressive nephropathy.

Although inheritance is varied, an X-linked inherited mutation in the COL4A5 gene (200 described) that encodes A 5 type IV collagen accounts for 80% of cases. This leads to affl icted , with carriers. Autosomal recessive (AR) forms account for 7 15% and autosomal dominant (AD) for 7 5% (gene: C OL4A3 / COL4A4 on chromosome 2). Affects 7 1 in 5, 000 live births. Thin membrane disease (TMD) A common AD inherited (occasionally sporadic) familial condition, presenting with microscopic haematuria, almost always with normal renal function. TMD was previously known as benign familial haematuria. It is present in 75 % of post-mortem studies and is a relatively common fi nding during the assessment of potential live Kidney donors. The normal GBM is 9 350nm thick but, in TMD, it is often less than 200nm (although otherwise structurally normal). The underlying defect probably affects type IV collagen integration into the GBM and results in a partial failure of basement membrane function. 40% of families have mutations in C OL4A3 / COL4A4 (20 described, usually a single nucleotide substitution associated with a single family). These probably represent the benign end of the spectrum of Alport syndrome. The additional TMD genetic loci have not yet been identifi ed. Symptoms and signs Both present with persistent microscopic haematuria. This occurs earlier in Alport s no haematuria by age 10 in a makes the diagnosis unlikely.

C1q nephropathy A mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, originally recognized for its close histological resemblance to lupus nephritis, in the absence of any serological or clinical criteria for the diagnosis of SLE. Histology shows a characteristic heavy deposition of C1q-containing deposits in the mesangium and elsewhere, with varying degrees of mesangial hypercellularity and wire loop capillary wall thickening. There are two dominant clinical and pathological phenotypes: (i) a minimal change or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis-like lesion, which typically presents as steroid-unresponsive nephrotic syndrome; (ii) an immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, associated with several different types of glomerular lesion, typically presenting as chronic kidney disease. C1q nephropathy is now generally considered as an focal segmental glomerulosclerosis variant. IgM nephropathy Is a similar lesion, again characterized by mesangial hypercellularity on light microscopy, with diffuse granular mesangial IgM and C3 deposition on immunostaining. IgM may also be non-specifi cally deposited in areas of sclerosis in many glomerular diseases, but here it is seen in the mesangium of non-sclerotic glomeruli. EM reveals generalized foot process effacement. It is still debated whether it represents a distinct disease entity or a variant of minimal change disease or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

MESANGIOPROLIFERATIVE GLOMERULONEPHRITIDES 573 574 CHAPTER 7 Diseases of the Kidney Thrombotic microangiopathies Introduction Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a histologic description encompassing several rare, but related, disorders, characterized clinically by a triad of haemolysis, consumptive thrombocytopenia, and tissue ischaemia (caused by platelet aggregation and thrombotic occlusion of small vessels) (see Table 7. 3). The two classical clinical presentations involving TMA are thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) ( b p. 576) and the haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) ( b p. 578) (see Table 7. 3). These conditions affect both adults and children and carry a very poor prognosis if left undiagnosed and untreated. 2 Suspect in the context of otherwise unexplained thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA). HUS vs TTP? These two conditions are increasingly considered as different presentations of the same underlying pathophysiological process (with the exception of diarrhoea associated (D) HUS, particularly in childhood (see b p. 578). TTP predominantly neurological 9 acute kidney injury (minimal). HUS acute kidney injury generally dominates the clinical picture. Neurological involvement minimal/absent. In view of this, they are now often referred to as TTP-HUS , with less weight being given to differentiating between the two. Clinical assessment Take a careful history for a diarrhoeal illness.

These differ in target population and pattern of organ involvement. Clinical and laboratory fi ndings often overlap, and diagnostic uncertainty is not uncommon. 576 CHAPTER 7 Diseases of the Kidney Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) Pathogenesis von Willebrand factor is released from endothelial cells as a large polymer and cleaved to form the mature polypeptide that acts as a matrix for haemostasis. The protease responsible for this cleavage is the zinc metalloproteinase ADAMTS13. If vWF-cleaving Protein activity is impaired (either an IgG autoantibody directed against the protease or an inherited mutation of the gene encoding ADAMTS13), then abnormally large vWF multimers enter the circulation where they bind and activate platelets. This leads to spontaneous platelet aggregation, platelet-rich (though fi brin-poor) thrombus formation and a systemic microangiopathy, with widespread deposition of platelet-vWF complexes (e. g. brain/ Kidney/ mesenteric vessels). Interestingly, ADAMTS13 knockout mice do not develop a TMA, suggesting a second hit (e. g. an infl ammatory or a prothrombotic stimulus) is required to initiate the disease. Causes Hereditary: rare, congenital mutations of the A DAMTS13 gene (e. g. Upshaw Schulman syndrome) Autoimmune: 40 70% of all TTP. Autoimmune inhibition of ADAMTS13. IgG autoantibodies against ADAMTS13 have also been demonstrated in drug-related TTP (e. g. ticlopidine, clopidogrel). Clinical features Classic pentad: Fever. Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. Thrombocytopenic purpura. CNS involvement (confusion, fi ts, or other neurological abnormality). Renal involvement (acute kidney injury). i blood pressure is more common with HUS than TTP. (cid: 2) Note: patients with profound ADAMTS13 defi ciency can present with bloody diarrhoea (non-infectious), presumably secondary to gut ischaemia. Investigations (see also b p. 574) For disease monitoring: dd platelet, Blood fi lm for red cell fragments, ii LDH, d haptoglobins. Low ADAMTS13 activity (5% normal) in the correct clinical context is diagnostic (however, the result of this specialist investigation may not be available to inform management decisions). Management Treatment aims to restore the ability to cleave vWF. THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA (TTP) 577 Plasma exchange (PEX) Allows large-volume plasma infusion as well as removal of vWF-cleaving Protein inhibitor, esp. if acute kidney injury with oligo-anuria (where plasma infusion without exchange may cause volume overload). Initiate ASAP, and continue daily until 2 days after remission (platelet count and LDH normalize). Usually 7 16 days. Exchange one plasma volume/day ( b p. 950). May require hydrocortisone 100 magnesium chlorphenamine 10 magnesium IVI to prevent allergic reactions to large volumes of plasma. Fresh frozen plasma (ideally platelet-poor) or cryosupernatant infusion. As 25 30mL/kg/day until improvement. 2 But only if passing Urine: beware volume overload. This is inferior to PEX but i s effi cacious if PEX is not available. R ituximab may have a role in more severe disease (particularly with severe neurologic involvement), non-responders to PEX, and if disease worsens despite treatment. Rituximab 375mg/m2 weekly x 4 (given in addition to steroids and PEX) appears to be safe and effective and reduce relapses. Other avoid platelet transfusion unless life-threatening bleeding (fuels the fi re). No role for aspirin or anticoagulants.

Prompt recognition and treatment will reduce this. A third will relapse. Renal survival is Good, with Dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury unusual in TTP (more common in HUS). 578 CHAPTER 7 Diseases of the Kidney Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) Introduction HUS is a renal-limited TMA, with widespread complications. There are three forms: (i) typical, (ii) atypical, and (iii) autoimmune. All present with acute kidney injury, thrombocytopenia, and MAHA. Typical (8090%) Associated with diarrhoea ( D ). Peak incidence in summer. Usually affects children 5 years. Occurs after food poisoning (esp. undercooked meat, unpasteurized milk). Pathogenic bacteria produce a Shiga-like exotoxin that is able to translocate, perhaps via neutrophils, across infl amed colonic mucosa into Blood. It then binds glomerular epithelial cells with High affi nity causing the release of prothrombotic factors and ultra-large vWF multimers. Atypical (1015%) Not associated with diarrhoea ( D ). Factor H defi ciency (a complement regulatory Protein) causes relapsing or familial HUS. Defi ciencies in other factors, e. g. C3, B, I, and CD46 (membrane cofactor Protein), cause a similar syndrome. Drugs and non-diarrhoeal infections can cause an HUS-like syndrome. These are generally associated with no (or only minor) reduction in ADAMTS13, suggesting a different pathophysiology to TTP. Autoimmune DEAP-HUS (defi ciency of complement factor H-related (CFHR) plasma proteins and autoantibody-positive HUS) is a novel subtype, affecting children. It is due to a combination of acquired and genetic factors and has a favourable response to treatment. Several hypotheses have been proposed for the pathophysiological basis of HUS-TTP in context of a normal ADAMTS13. These include endothelial injury (l loss of, or defi cient, VEGF leads to TMA) and increased plasminogen activator inhibitor. Infections associated with D HUS E. coli O157: H7 subtype (70% of D HUS in developed countries). Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1. Salmonella, Campylobacter, or Yersinia. Associations of D HUS Inherited HUS. Drugs: quinine, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus, ciprofl oxacin, the contraceptive pill, heparin, chemotherapy. Infections, e. g. S. pneumoniae or rickettsial. HAEMOLYTIC URAEMIC SYNDROME (HUS) 579 Clinical features Triad of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal injury. Watery or bloody diarrhoea. Fever, i blood pressure, acute kidney injury, and volume overload. May progress to multiorgan failure, with pancreatitis and a cardiomyopathy. Investigations (see b p. 576) i WCC common. Fresh stool for culture. Disease monitoring: d d platelet, red cell fragments on fi lm, ii LDH. Management 2 If in doubt, treat as TTP until diagnosis confi rmed. For D HUS, management is supportive alone (including RRT if required). No role for anticoagulation. Antibiotics may paradoxically increase Shiga toxin release and should be avoided. PEX or plasma infusion do not improve outcome (as, unlike TTP, there is no underlying replaceable causative factor). Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks complement activity by cleavage of C5 ( b p. 391). There is great interest in its use in atypical HUS and for the prevention of relapse post-transplantation ( b p. 420). Prognosis Poor prognostic factors: i age, High WCC, D HUS, S. pneumoniae or Shigella infection, complete anuria. 580 CHAPTER 7 Diseases of the Kidney Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis Introduction Acute (tubulo-)interstitial nephritis (AIN) is a common parenchymal cause of acute kidney injury. Peak incidence in middle age but can affect all ages. . 70 90% of cases are drug-induced, although the spectrum of causative agents has changed. AIN is characterized by an infl ammatory cell infi ltrate in the renal interstitium. This is occasionally associated with a systemic delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (fever, arthritis, rash).",

UE, bone profi Blood (? i Ca2 esp. in sarcoidosis), LFT, FBC differentials (eosinophilia may be present), i ESR. Consider ANA, anti-Ro, and anti-La (? Sj ö gren s syndrome). USS shows normal-sized (or slightly enlarged) kidneys. CXR and serum ACE (? sarcoid). Renal biopsy: usually necessary to confi rm diagnosis. ACUTE TUBULOINTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS 581 Histology Intense interstitial infl ammatory cell infi ltrate, consisting of lymphocytes and monocytes (9 eosinophils). Giant cells and granulomata may point to TB or sarcoidosis. The presence of interstitial fi brosis imparts a worse prognosis, as in all forms of renal injury. Glomeruli are normal. Management Depends, to an extent, on the underlying cause or precipitant. Treatment of sarcoidosis ( b p. 670) are outlined elsewhere. 3 Stop offending drug(s). X Corticosteroids: Widely used, although there is no Good evidence to support this practice. May hasten recovery but do not appear to infl uence overall prognosis. A reasonable approach: Dialysis-dependent: treat with corticosteroids. Dialysis-independent: observe for up to 14 days following drug withdrawal; if improvement, continue expectant management; if no improvement, treat with corticosteroids. Information from a renal biopsy may also inform decisionmaking; e. g. acute infl ammation with interstitial oedema may favour steroid treatment, whilst established fi brosis would not. Treatment with prednisolone 1mg/kg/day PO, tapering slowly against response for a 3 6 month course ( b p. 540). For drug-related AIN: Outcomes: 40% will be left with chronic kidney disease, and 10% will progress to end-stage renal disease. Final glomerular filtration rate does not correlate with the maximal value during the early acute phase. Of those with milder disease, the majority will return to baseline renal function. Even those requiring renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury usually regain independent renal function. Mortality rate 5%. Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome (TINU) Uncommon. Unlike AIN, affects predominantly younger . Presents as anterior uveitis (often bilateral) and AIN (which may be separated in time). Additional features include weight loss, d hemoglobin, i ESR, and deranged LFT. Pathophysiology is poorly understood, although IgG antibodies against modifi ed C-reactive Protein, (mCRP) may be relevant. Differential diagnosis: autoimmune disease (esp. Sj ö gren s) and sarcoidosis. Ophthalmology input should be sought urgently. Treat the renal lesion with 1mg/kg/day prednisolone, tapering slowly against resolution for 3 6 months. Relapse is common, and complete steroid withdrawal may not be possible.",

The tubulointerstitial compartment is extensively fi brosed, often with a lymphocytic infi ltrate in scarred areas. Tubules are often dilated and atrophic. Glomeruli are largely spared (although glomerular obsolescence may be seen as a result of nephron dropout). Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis exists as a distinct diagnosis (drug-induced AIN of any cause may progress if exposure is not limited or the underlying condition is not treated) but chronic tubulointerstitial injury is a feature of progressive chronic kidney disease of any cause, including glomerulonephritis ( b p. 200). Causes Drugs (NSAIDs). Refl ux nephropathy ( b p. 712). Sarcoidosis. TB. Autoimmune diseases (Sj ö gren s syndrome). Metabolic causes, e. g. chronic d potassium (e. g. in anorexia nervosa). Heavy metals (see b p. 583). Balkan endemic and Chinese herbal nephropathies. Clinical features Impaired urinary concentration (nocturia, polyuria). Often normal blood pressure (due to relative salt-losing state). LMW tubular proteinuria (e. g. B 2 microglobulin). Glycosuria (impaired tubular handling) 9 renal tubular acidosis. chronic kidney disease. Small, symmetrical kidneys on USS (exception: refl ux nephropathy where asymmetry is common). Investigations MSU for M, CS, EMU for AFB, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (proteinuria often 1g/day), UE, bone profi Blood (? i Ca2 ), serum ACE, ANA, anti-Ro/La, USS kidneys. Lithium-induced nephropathy (See b p. 904. ) Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) Affects men and women 30 years old inhabiting lands drained by the Danube River. Characterized by tubulointerstitial atrophy and scarring. Cause remains unknown. Patients are usually normotensive, with a urinary concentrating defect (polyuria), and may have LMW tubular proteinuria (1g/day) and glycosuria. USS shows small, symmetrical kidneys. There is an increased incidence of transitional cell carcinoma of the entire urinary tract; new haematuria should be fully investigated, and Urine cytology is recommended at least annually. CHRONIC TUBULOINTERSTITIAL DISEASE 583 Chinese herb nephropathy (b p. 901) A histological disorder similar to BEN, with tubulointerstitial scarring and glomerular sparing as the principal features. Appears to be due to aristolochic acid, an ingredient in many Chinese herbal preparations (notably as a slimming agent). Clinical presentation and histology are so similar to BEN that a similar aetiology has been suggested, although this remains to be proven. The incidence of urothelial malignancies is very High, and surveillance is mandatory. In those considered for transplantation after end-stage renal disease, bilateral native nephrouretectomy is often recommended to reduce the risk of malignant disease following immunosuppression. Lead nephropathy Exposure to lead, including occupational, may cause chronic poisoning, with progressive tubulointerstitial nephritis. Tubular injury results in decreased urate excretion with hyperuricaemia and gout. At-risk individuals with unexplained chronic kidney disease, associated with High serum urate concentrations, should be assessed for total lead burden by either bone X-ray fl uorescence or an European Dialysis and Transplant Association lead chelation test. Treatment includes long-term lead depletion with European Dialysis and Transplant Association or DMSA. Lead has also been shown to be a risk factor for progression of chronic kidney disease of other causes. Cadmium exposure causes a similar nephropathy. Salt-losing nephropathy Refers to inappropriate renal losses of Sodium (and thus) Water. It generally occurs in the context of chronic tubulointerstitial disorders. Losses rarely exceed 100mmol sodium (2 3 L/day), as increased delivery of sodium to the macula densa causes protective afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction with d glomerular filtration rate (so-called tubulo-glomerular feedback). However, hypovolaemia and hyponatraemia can be clinically signifi cant, if untreated.",

If not, salt supplementation. 584 CHAPTER 7 Diseases of the Kidney Analgesic nephropathy Introduction Analgesic nephropathy (AN) was fi rst described after chronic phenacetin use (a pro-drug of paracetamol). Fortunately, it has declined in prevalence over the last 3 decades from 7 3% to 7 0. 2%. The use of co mbination analgesic preparations now accounts for most cases (e. g. paracetamol codeine, or paracetamol aspirin). Aspirin alone will not usually cause AN, although paracetamol, if used in suffi cient quantities, might (2kg cumulatively; equivalent to about 8 years of daily full-dose ingestion). Renal injury begins with ischaemic changes in the medulla, progressing to tubulointerstitial scarring, glomerulosclerosis, and papillary necrosis ( b p. 585). (See Fig. 7. 9 ) Analgesic nephropathy is also associated with accelerated atherosclerosis, although the mechanism is unclear.

(2005) Oxford Textbook of Clinical Nephrology. Oxford University Press, Oxford. Symptoms and signs A history of analgesic use may be diffi cult to elicit: suspect if chronic Pain syndromes, such as headaches or backache. Dyspepsia is common. Nocturia and polyuria (loss of concentrating ability), episodic colicky fl ank Pain, and frank haematuria due to papillary necrosis (sloughed papillae) may occasionally be evident in the Urine. i blood pressure, as chronic kidney disease develops. Investigations Urine dipstick often bland or modest proteinuria only. Sterile pyuria on Urine microscopy. d hemoglobin, i serum creatinine, and d estimated glomerular filtration rate. Classical IVU appearances historically (small kidneys with clubbed calyces), but computed tomography is now preferred. ANALGESIC NEPHROPATHY 585 Management Stop all analgesics. This is often extremely diffi cult, but reducing the analgesic burden slows disease progression (those who continue have a 6-fold risk of reaching Dialysis or death in an observational study of 78 patients). 1 The input of a specialist Pain management team is highly desirable. 2 Surveillance for urothelial malignancies (transitional cell carcinoma occurs in up to 10% of confi rmed cases of analgesic nephropathy). May be multiple, in unusual sites, or even bilateral. New haematuria merits full urological investigation. Annual Urine cytology is a useful screening tool. Papillary necrosis The end result of chronic medullary hypoxia: vulnerable papillae suffer a further (acute) ischaemic injury, undergo necrosis, and are shed into the renal pelvis. Clinical presentation May be asymptomatic. Colicky fl ank Pain (as the papilla traverses the ureter). Visible passage of a papilla (or part thereof). Frank haematuria. Unilateral ureteric obstruction. computed tomography may show calcifi ed papillae and an irregular renal contour.

ARAS and ischaemic nephropathy Increasing incidence with i age ( 9 7% in people aged 65) and in those known to have atherosclerotic disease elsewhere (9 50% if known peripheral vascular disease). However, anatomic ARAS may be haemodynamically unimportant and is associated with i blood pressure in only 50% of cases. Generally, any stenosis 70% tends to be functionally signifi cant, as is bilateral ARAS or disease in an artery to a single functioning Kidney. Patients with ARAS or ischaemic nephropathy have a substantial excess risk for CV death (myocardial infarction and stroke). ARAS should be suspected in older patients with clinically evident peripheral, coronary, or cerebrovascular atherosclerotic disease, or those with known risk factors (dyslipidaemia, smoking, Diabetes, i blood pressure). Clinical presentation i blood pressure often resistant to treatment (i. e. 140/90mmHg on three drugs). Renal dysfunction. i serum creatinine or d estimated glomerular filtration rate of up to 20% with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Fluid retention, often diuretic-resistant. Pathophysiology Atherosclerotic plaque involves the ostium or proximal 2cm of the renal artery, often extending from the aorta. Renal disease is caused by a fall in perfusion, resulting in sympathetic overactivity and renin release. This leads to overproduction of A2 ( l vasoconstriction) and aldosterone release ( l salt and Water retention). The pro-fi brotic actions of these factors, in combination with hypoxia, drive a complex cellular activity termed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). An essential process developmentally; EMT involves loss of epithelial cell apico b asal polarity and cell c ell adhesion characteristics. Cells become motile and acquire a fi broblast phenotype. EMT underpins progressive renal fi brosis and scarring, with loss of functioning tubules ( l chronic kidney disease clinically). Symptoms and signs Evidence of central or peripheral vascular disease is perhaps the most important clinical fi nding. i blood pressure, peripheral oedema, pulmonary congestion, abdominal bruits (Low predictive value in isolation), palpable AAA. Generally, bland Urine on dipstick or Low-grade proteinuria only (e. g. 1g/day). This can be a helpful clinical clue, although the development of s focal segmental glomerulosclerosis may lead to higher levels. RENOVASCULAR DISEASE 587 Flash pulmonary oedema refers to sudden, often episodic, pulmonary oedema, with i blood pressure and without any precipitating cardiac event (or in the context of relatively normal LV function). It is caused by exaggerated activity of the RAAS ( l acute salt and Water retention and volume overload). Probably overdiagnosed: thorough cardiac assessment is mandatory. Loin Pain, a sudden decline in renal function, and new haematuria may indicate renal infarction. Investigations (See Fig. 7. 10) serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, UE (? d potassium due to i aldosterone), lipids. Plasma renin will be High, but this is therapeutically unhelpful. Urine dipstick, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Evidence of vascular disease elsewhere, e. g. ECG. Potential imaging includes: USS kidneys for renal size and symmetry. A difference of 1. 5cm in renal length is suspicious. computed tomography angiography is increasingly sensitive for ostial lesions. MRA. However, gadolinium-enhanced MRA is relatively contraindicated in individuals with a glomerular filtration rate 30mL/min (b p. 51). MR also tends to overestimate the extent of a stenosis. Newer magnetic resonance imaging software is enabling non-gadolinium MRA scanning. Duplex USS with Doppler examination. Resistive index (RI) is a surrogate for impeded fl ow.

Modifi cation of cardiovascular disease risk factors is 6 a primary objective: stop smoking, exercise, healthy diet, statins. Consider aspirin 75mg od. Control blood pressure Aim for 130/85mmHg, using non-angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker drugs, for example: Calcium channel blocker or B -blocker. Early use of loop diuretics titrated vs response (e. g. furosemide 40 160mg daily) can be effective, as i blood pressure is driven by salt and Water overload. Further management The primary goal is to prevent loss of renal function. Two treatment options exist, conservative or interventional. Selection can be diffi cult. Interventional management Includes percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) 9 stenting and surgical revascularization. PTRA alone is associated with a High incidence of restenosis stenting is 6 widely advocated. However, the ASTRAL trial ( b p. 589) has suggested only a limited role for interventional management. The selection of candidates who may benefi t from intervention is diffi cult and without a robust evidence base. However, many clinicians would consider such a strategy in the following situations: Bilateral critical ARAS or critical ARAS to a single functioning Kidney. ARAS that is known to be of recent onset. Refractory i blood pressure and volume overload. Flash pulmonary oedema ( b p. 587). Rapidly deteriorating renal function. Other factors to consider if an interventional approach is considered: The stenosis should be High grade (70%). The Kidney(s) should be 7. 5cm in length, implying meaningful nephron mass and 6 potentially salvageable renal function. The absence of scars on 99m Tc-DMSA isotope scintigraphy may usefully predict recoverable renal function. The presence of heavy proteinuria may imply hyperfi ltration injury and s focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in a scarred Kidney (b p. 562). The risk of cholesterol emboli, arterial dissection (with potential limb injury), and contrast-induced acute kidney injury ( b p. 148) should be weighed against potential benefi ts. Surgical revascularization is usually reserved for those undergoing simultaneous aortic surgery. MANAGEMENT OF ARAS 589 Conservative management Given the pathophysiological importance of A2, a trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker is often warranted under close supervision. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker will reduce CV risk and may retard progression of chronic kidney disease. They will also block A2-mediated vasoconstriction and fi brosis. 2 However, they will also drop renal perfusion Hypertension and may precipitate acute kidney injury. (cid: 2) Patients must be adequately hydrated (check for postural drop). Start with Low dose, and measure serum creatinine regularly, e. g. alternate days. Increase dose, according to blood pressure, if no deterioration in renal function ( i serum creatinine or d estimated glomerular filtration rate 20% from baseline). Angioplasty and Stenting for Renal Artery Lesions (ASTRAL) trial ASTRAL is the largest trial, to date, of PTRA stenting medical therapy vs medical therapy alone; 806 patients were randomized in an unblinded fashion.

No signifi - cant improvements in blood pressure or reductions in renal adverse events, MACE, or mortality were seen. Conclusion Revascularization offered no benefi t over medical therapy in the management of ARAS but was associated with an increased risk of morbidity (two procedural related deaths and three limb amputations). Caveat There is a consensus view (non-evidence-based) that individuals with fl ash pulmonary oedema, High-grade bilateral stenosis (or a High-grade stenosis affecting a single functioning Kidney), or those presenting with acute kidney injury should be offered intervention. Such scenarios were probably underrepresented in the ASTRAL cohort. ASTRAL Investigators (2009). Revascularization versus medical therapy for renal-artery stenosis. New England Journal of Medicine, 3 61, 1953 62. 590 CHAPTER 7 Diseases of the Kidney Other renovascular diseases Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) Affects asymptomatic young women (15 5 0 years), often with i blood pressure. Renal function is generally normal. Much less common than ARAS. True prevalence in both normotensive and hypertensive populations unknown. Characterized by arterial fi broplasia that may affect many vascular beds (intracranial, carotid, coronary, and limb). Pathogenesis unknown. A genetic predisposition operates in some (with autosomal dominant inheritance). Often involves both renal arteries, classically affecting the mid-distal renal portion of the vessel (rather than the ostium in ARAS). Angiography shows a string of beads appearance with normal-calibre vessels on either side (see Fig. 7. 11). i blood pressure of FMD may be cured (withdrawal of all drugs) or improved by angioplasty, particularly in woman 50 years with i blood pressure of 8 years duration and with few stenoses in other arterial beds. Renal vein thrombosis (RVT) RVT is usually found in association with the nephrotic syndrome (particularly membranous nephropathy, b p. 564) when it may be unior bilateral. It is very rare without some form of concomitant hypercoagulable state. It may be seen in association with tumours, esp. renal cell carcinoma, where there is invasion and distortion of the renal vein. May present as: pulmonary emboli, renal infarction (loin Pain, haematuria, i serum creatinine, i AST, and i LDH). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography/venography or Doppler USS (operator-dependent) of the renal veins should be diagnostic. Proven RVT should be treated with anticoagulation. Cholesterol emboli May cause partial occlusion of the small renal vessels, with downstream ischaemia. Showers of emboli may present suddenly as acute kidney injury or, more commonly, as a gradual decline in renal function. Characteristically occurs in elderly patients known to have extensive atherosclerosis who undergo endovascular intervention (particularly aortic). It is an important differential diagnosis of contrast-induced acute kidney injury ( b p. 148). Anticoagulation (and thrombolysis) are also risk factors. Patients may also develop embolic infarcts in other end-arterial territories, including digits, retina, GI tract, and skin (l livedo reticularis). The Urine is usually bland (although proteinuria may occur over time). Eosinophilia, eosinophiluria, and d C3/C4 may be present. Renal biopsy shows characteristic intravascular clefts where cholesterol emboli were present before tissue preparation. No specifi c therapy is helpful, although aggressive CV risk factor management, including blood pressure and cholesterol, may improve patient survival. Renal prognosis is often poor.

It is responsible for 5 10% patients in an end-stage renal disease programme. Inheritance autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Mutations in the genes polycystic kidney disease-1 (located on chromosome 16) and polycystic kidney disease-2 (chromosome 4) result in defective synthesis of the proteins polycystin-1 and -2, respectively. Both polycystin-1 and -2 are ubiquitously expressed by epithelial cells throughout the body. polycystic kidney disease-1 mutations are seven times more common than polycystic kidney disease-2 and associated with more aggressive disease (onset of end-stage renal disease, on average, 15 years earlier). Pathophysiology Polycystin-1 is a membrane receptor signalling Protein that co-localizes with polycystin-2 (a calcium-permeable channel) within the cilia of renal collecting duct epithelial cells. This polycystin complex acts as an extracellular mechanosensor (luminal fl ow disturbs the cilia and triggers the apparatus) that assists in the regulation of cell proliferation, adhesion, differentiation, and maturation (l all ultimately maintain tubular integrity and calibre). Failure of normal polycystin complex formation results in dysregulated cell turnover and uncontrolled cell proliferation in response to growth factors. Proliferating tubular cells form tubular cysts that close off the associated nephron and expand in size over time. It is estimated that 1% of nephrons undergo such cystic transformation. However, local tissue ischaemia and pro-fi brotic cytokine release drive a process of EMT ( b p. 586), resulting in scarring and ultimately progressive chronic kidney disease. Clinical presentation Patients may present with a family history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. A careful history for renal disease, i blood pressure, stroke (intracranial haemorrhage), or premature death may pinpoint carriers of the gene mutation. Inheritance is autosomal dominant, so 50% of offspring should be affected. 2 Importantly, 25 40% of new patients will have no family history. Patients being investigated for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease should be given information about the disorder before and after testing. Clinical features include: Flank or loin Pain arising from large cysts. Acute Pain may suggest cyst rupture or bleeding. Dipstick-positive haematuria 9 episodic frank haematuria. i blood pressure. Nocturia and polyuria (loss of urinary concentrating ability). Low-grade proteinuria may be present (usually 1g/day). If presenting late, uraemic symptoms ( b p. 212). AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT POLYCYSTIC Kidney DISEASE (autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease) 593 Investigations USS remains the investigation of choice. As autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is an evolving disease, the timing of the scan is important. In otherwise asymptomatic at-risk individuals, USS should be performed after age 20 to improve negative predictive value. For confi rmation of diagnosis, the Ravine criteria are useful (see Table 7. 4). Table 7. 4 Ravine criteria Age ve family history ve family history 30 years 2 cysts in either Kidney 5 cysts in either Kidney 30 60 years 4 cysts in either Kidney 5 cysts in either Kidney 60 years 8 cysts in either Kidney 8 cysts in either Kidney 2 Valid for polycystic kidney disease-1 mutation alone. polycystic kidney disease-2 mutations present later, so these criteria tend to give false negative results. Other radiological features Increased renal size is common (often 20cm in length). Cysts in other organs (Liver, pancreas, spleen) may also be present and helpful to differentiate autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease from multiple simple cysts. (See Fig. 7.",

Oxford: Oxford University Press. 594 CHAPTER 7 Diseases of the Kidney autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: complications and treatment Hypertension i blood pressure may be the fi rst presentation of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, affecting 7 60% of those with normal renal function. It is thought to be s to increased renin generation in ischaemic renal tissue compressed by expanding cysts. Meticulous blood pressure control (aiming for target blood pressure 130/80mmHg) is important to protect an often young cohort of patients from progressive end-organ damage. Although proteinuria is not a dominant feature of the disease, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker are still favoured as fi rst-line therapy, with escalation to other agents, as necessary ( b p. 204). chronic kidney disease Although many patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease will never reach end-stage renal disease, progressive chronic kidney disease is nonetheless common. Males diagnosed at a younger age, early i blood pressure, large kidneys, black race, and the polycystic kidney disease-1 mutation have a worse renal prognosis. At end-stage renal disease, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients enjoy better survival following Dialysis and transplantation than the non-autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease end-stage renal disease population, refl ecting a younger age and lower burden of CV disease in this group. Cyst haemorrhage Presents with unilateral fl ank Pain of abrupt onset 9 haematuria (if the cyst communicates with the urinary space) (see Table 7. 5). Management is conservative, with hydration and analgesia. Individuals with a history of repeated cyst haemorrhage have an earlier onset of end-stage renal disease. Recurrent haemorrhage may sometimes necessitate nephrectomy (either bilateral or unilateral). Cyst infection Flank Pain, fever, and systemic upset (see Table 7. 5 ). Culture Blood and Urine, and give a prolonged course of antimicrobials (according to sensitivities, but ciprofl oxacin and co-trimoxazole have Good cyst penetration). computed tomography, 99m Tc-ciprofl oxacin, and PET scanning may demonstrate infected cysts if there is doubt regarding the source of infection. Recurrent cyst infection may sometimes necessitate nephrectomy (either bilateral or unilateral). Nephrolithiasis 20% of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients have associated renal stones, usually uric acid or calcium oxalate. Diagnosis is best made with computed tomography scanning (b p. 716). Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) 4 10% of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients have ICAs. Specifi c mutations appear to predispose to aneurysm formation, so certain family pedigrees may have a positive history. Such families merit screening with MRA. Symptomatic ICAs or those 10mm diameter need surgical intervention, but the optimal management of asymptomatic ICAs of 10mm is less certain. Rupture presents as subarachnoid haemorrhage, most commonly in patients age 50 years with poor blood pressure control (50% mortality or severe disability). autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: COMPLICATIONS AND TREATMENT 595 Table 7. 5 autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: haemorrhage, infection, or stone?

Large cysts may cause epigastric fullness and abdominal discomfort. Needle puncture or surgical de-roofi ng may be possible. Other manifestations Mitral valve prolapse and aortic regurgitation, diverticular disease, and hernias are more common in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Clinical trials and potential future treatments A better understanding of the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease has offered hope for future therapies that might ameliorate cyst development. As cyst formation begins in utero, such interventions would require autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease diagnosis and treatment from an earlier age. Experimental therapies have shown promise in both animal models and human pilot studies. These include: Vasopressin receptor antagonists to d cyst formation (via d cAMP). mTOR inhibition (or paclitaxel) to reduce cell proliferation. Antagonism of epidermal growth factor. Long acting somatostatin analogues. However, it can be diffi cult to select appropriate outcome measures in clinical trials that aim to assess such therapies given the length of time it takes to develop chronic kidney disease and eventual end-stage renal disease (if at all), a very long follow-up period is required. Two clinical trials involving mTOR inhibition have failed to show a benefi cial effect on glomerular filtration rate (although one did demonstrate a reduction in cyst growth with everolimus). The CRISP study demonstrated that a combination of Kidney and total cyst volume, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging, is negatively associated with glomerular filtration rate. Many trials now use such volumetric assessments as outcome measures. It is hoped that risk stratifi cation for progressive chronic kidney disease may identify a subpopulation of patients who will benefi t the most from interventions to retard cyst growth (and 6 be the ideal participants in future clinical trials). 596 CHAPTER 7 Diseases of the Kidney One such risk factor for progressive chronic kidney disease is increased 24h Urine osmolality. Animal studies have suggested that ADH may have a role in cyst growth, so V2 receptor blockade could be of therapeutic benefi t. This is the subject of ongoing clinical trials; e. g. the vasopressin V2 antagonist tolvaptan has been shown to slow progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in a 3-year, multi-centre, blinded study of 71500 patients, halving the rate of Kidney volume expansion and slowing glomerular filtration rate reduction by 30%. However, safety concerns (particularly regarding Liver toxicity) mean it is not yet approved for this indication. A recent 3-year study suggested that the somatostatin analogue called octreotide long-acting release (LAR), delivered as a monthly IM injection, might reduce Kidney and cyst volume and slow chronic kidney disease progression2.

It is a disease of infancy and childhood, presenting with polycystic kidneys, progressive chronic kidney disease, congenital hepatic fi brosis, and portal hypertension. It is much less common than autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (estimated prevalence 1: 20, 000 live births). Juvenile nephronophthisis A recessively inherited condition (7 1 in 50, 000), characterized by cystic change and tubulointerstitial fi brosis, presenting in early childhood (age 1 year) and leading to end-stage renal disease in adolescence. Mutations in at least fi ve NPHP loci have been described, most commonly NPHP1 (associated with earlier onset). Imaging characteristically reveals echo-bright kidneys with a few corticomedullary cysts. Clinical features: polydipsia and polyuria but often presents as end-stage renal disease.

It is a developmental, rather than a genetic, anomaly. Clinically, there is no family history, and patients are usually identifi ed either incidentally or when investigated for UTI or stones (see Table 7. 7). Impaired calcium handling in the collecting ducts predisposes to formation of calcium-containing stones (often in cysts). Consider the diagnosis in young patients presenting with calcium stones. Haematuria (microscopic or gross) and recurrent UTIs may also complicate the disorder. Diagnosis is made on imaging; traditionally IVU (typical calyceal brush ), now computed tomography. Renal impairment is very rare, and management should be directed at infection and prevention of stone formation. Medullary cystic Kidney disease Autosomal dominant inheritance, presenting in early adulthood with progressive renal impairment. The affected genes M chronic kidney disease-1 and 2 encode key signalling proteins in the renal cilia. Small cysts (1 10mm) form at the corticomedullary junction, with associated tubulointerstitial infl ammation and scarring (glomeruli are unaffected). Affected individuals have a positive family history and present with nocturia, polydipsia, and polyuria (impaired concentrating ability). Urine dipstick is usually bland and blood pressure often normal (there may be relative salt loss) (see Table 7. 7). Investigation shows small to normal-sized kidneys on USS. computed tomography may demonstrate the cystic change. Impaired urate excretion and hyperuricaemia ( 9 gout) may occur.

It is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (and end-stage renal disease) in the western world, and its incidence is rising in developing countries. This increase has been driven by the increased incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, improved life expectancy for these patients and better access to end-stage renal disease care. diabetic nephropathy, therefore, consumes a very signifi cant amount of healthcare resource. The topics on b pp. 604619 are among the most important in this book. 2 There is very Good evidence that the quality of Diabetes care has a signifi cant impact on the natural history of diabetic nephropathy, with e arly treatment delaying or preventing onset. Defi nitions The earliest evidence of diabetic renal disease is the appearance of microalbuminuria, i. e. Low, but abnormal, amounts of albuminuria ( ≥ 30mg/day) ( b p. 60). Patients with microalbuminuria are often said to have incipient nephropathy. diabetic nephropathy ( overt nephropathy) describes a clinical syndrome characterized by: Persistent albuminuria (300mg/day) on at least two occasions, 3 months apart. i blood pressure. Progressive d glomerular filtration rate. 2 As well as a hallmark of diabetic nephropathy, incipient and overt nephropathy are important markers of i CV morbidity and mortality in both type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus. They warrant aggressive intervention to improve all CV risk factors (e. g. LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking cessation, exercise, etc.",

Epidemiology 7 20 30% of patients with Diabetes mellitus develop diabetic nephropathy. 7 15% of end-stage renal disease in the UK is s to diabetic nephropathy and is much higher elsewhere ( 7 40% in the ultrasound). 90% of these individuals will have type 2 diabetes mellitus. Incidence and natural history depend on ethnicity, e. g. Pima Indians ( b p. 8) have a 40% incidence of end-stage renal disease 10 years after developing microalbuminuria. Patients who have no proteinuria after 25 years of Diabetes have only a very small risk of developing diabetic nephropathy. DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY 605 type 1 diabetes mellitus Microalbuminuria will develop in 20 30% of patients after 15 years. i blood pressure often appears at the same time as microalbuminuria. Without treatment, 7 80% will increase their urinary albumin excretion at a rate of 7 10 20% per year, with overt nephropathy developing over 10 15 years. Overt diabetic nephropathy rarely develops within 10 years of diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Without treatment, overt diabetic nephropathy will lead to a progressive fall in glomerular filtration rate over time. The rate is highly variable between individuals (2 20mL/min/ year). 50% of those with overt diabetic nephropathy will develop end-stage renal disease within 10 years (75% within 20 years). Patients who progress from no microalbuminuria to microalbuminuria or from microalbuminuria to overt albuminuria are likely to have higher hemoglobin hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure values. The overall long-term prevalence of end-stage renal disease in type 1 diabetes mellitus has recently fallen to 10%, having previously been higher. type 2 diabetes mellitus 7 3% of patients will have overt diabetic nephropathy at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (Diabetes may have been present for some time prior to discovery). Proteinuria is less specifi c for diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Without treatment, 20 40% of those with microalbuminuria will progress to overt diabetic nephropathy. In the UKPDS study, annual risk for progression from no microalbuminuria l microalbuminuria was 2. 0%; from microalbuminuria l macroalbuminuria 2. 8%, and from macroalbuminuria l i serum creatinine or end-stage renal disease 2. 3%. The rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate is variable but less predictable than for type 1 diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes mellitus older patients with associated CV disease). After 20 years of overt diabetic nephropathy, 7 20% will have progressed to end-stage renal disease. These numbers are hugely signifi cant because of the higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. 2 The greater risk of death from associated CV disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus prevents many with earlier nephropathy from progressing to end-stage renal disease. 606 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease Diabetic nephropathy: progression Natural history The evolution of diabetic nephropathy can be described in stages (see Table 8. 1). This applies to both type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, although the latter is much less predictable.

Risk of death was higher than the risk for progression to the next phase once microalbuminuria present. Happily, more recent studies, e. g. IDNT and RENAAL, have challenged these data in an European Renal Association of better Diabetes care, demonstrating what improved care may achieve. Nonetheless, CV mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus remains a signifi cant public health issue. See Box 8. 1. Intensive monitoring and treatment infl uence natural history, preventing incipient, and progression to overt, nephropathy. The DCCT trial randomized 1, 400 non-hypertensive type 1 diabetics to either intensive or conventional insulin therapy. During a mean 6. 5 years follow-up, hemoglobin hemoglobin A1c levels were signifi cantly lower in the intensive group, with a reduction in microalbuminuria. The benefi ts of Good glycaemic control for preventing progression in type 2 diabetes mellitus were clearly demonstrated in the UKPDS study. DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY: PROGRESSION 607 3 Box 8. 1 Diabetic nephropathy and risk of death type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with substantially increased risk of premature death a risk that is primarily focused on those with nephropathy. 10-year mortality data in 7 15, 000 subjects in the 3rd ultrasound National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) revealed: Reference group (subjects without Diabetes or Kidney disease), 10-year cumulative all-cause mortality of 7. 7%. For type 2 diabetes mellitus without Kidney disease, this rises to 11. 5%. For type 2 diabetes mellitus with Kidney disease, this rises to an astonishing 31. 1%, representing an absolute risk difference with the reference group of 23. 4% (adjusted for demographics, smoking, and blood pressure)! Development and progression The following are important risk factors for the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy in both type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus: Poor glycaemic control. Onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus before age 20. i blood pressure: 30% have i blood pressure at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. 70% have i blood pressure at diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy. Smoking. gender. Ethnicity (Indo-Asians, African Americans, Pima Indians in the ultrasound). Familial tendency. Socio-economic factors, esp. poverty. 2 Once established the most important factors fuelling progression are: blood pressure. Glycaemic control. Degree of proteinuria. 608 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease Diabetic nephropathy: pathology Introduction The pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy is multifaceted, with several mechanisms contributing to the renal injury and development of the characteristic histological changes. Histology Ultimately, renal hypertrophy, hyperfi ltration (initially with i glomerular filtration rate to above normal), and intrarenal hypertension cause mesangial expansion, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fi brosis. The cardinal histological features are: Mesangial expansion ( l intercapillary, or Kimmelstiel Wilson, nodule formation, often with capillary lumen encroachment). Glomerular and tubular basement membrane thickening. Nodular glomerulosclerosis. Vascular changes are also usually present: Vessel changes from i blood pressure. Arteriosclerosis. Afferent and efferent arteriolar hyalinosis. Tubular atrophy and interstitial fi brosis appear as diabetic nephropathy (and 6 chronic kidney disease) progress. Immunostaining may demonstrate non-specifi c linear staining for IgG in glomerular and tubular basement membranes and Bowman s capsule. Arteriolar damage, interstitial fi brosis, and s focal segmental glomerulosclerosis may be the dominant lesions in older type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (often with less proteinuria and more vascular disease clinically). Pathophysiology Hyperglycaemia The magnitude of hyperglycaemia correlates with the functional and structural changes of diabetic nephropathy.",

    "text": "Pathophysiology Hyperglycaemia The magnitude of hyperglycaemia correlates with the functional and structural changes of diabetic nephropathy. Long-term studies in type 1 diabetes mellitus (DCCT) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (UKPDS) have demonstrated that Blood glucose concentration is related to the development of microalbuminuria and progression to overt diabetic nephropathy. Time-averaged hemoglobin hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure correlate with loss of renal function. Hyperglycaemia: Stimulates mesangial cell matrix production and cell growth, leading to early glomerular enlargement. Causes to advanced glycation end-product (AGE) formation: AGEs result from non-enzymatic reaction between glucose and proteins. They normally undergo renal excretion and accumulate as diabetic nephropathy progresses, particularly in the circulation and the kidneys. AGEs: (i) impair function of glycated proteins; (ii) cause abnormal cell-to-cell interactions through cross-link formation; (iii) bind endogenous receptors for AGEs (RAGE), with deleterious consequences. Causes i oxidative stress. DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY: PATHOLOGY 609 Leads to activity of Protein kinase C and hexosamine pathways (both l i production of various profi brotic cytokines, including TGFB ). Increases expression of glomerular TGFB (and other mitogens) l cellular hypertrophy, i collagen synthesis, and i matrix deposition. Promotes l i VEGF expression, possibly via the adenosine A receptor ( l endothelial injury, vascular change, and 2B podocytopathy). Glomerular haemodynamics Glomerular hypertension and hyperfi ltration occur early. A glomerular filtration rate of 25 50% above normal is observed in 50% of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus of 5 years duration. Hyperfi ltration appears to be caused by mediators involved in renal artery stenosis, nitric oxide, and cyclo-oxygenase pathways. Endothelin -1 is a potent vasoconstrictor, the levels of which are increased in both plasma and renal tissue of diabetic subjects. The expression of receptors ET-A and ET-B is also increased. ET-1 function is receptor-dependent (ET-A l smooth muscle vasoconstriction and glomerulosclerosis; ET-B l vasodilation). Systemic i blood pressure also drives glomerular i blood pressure. Haemodynamic disturbance l arteriolar and glomerular sclerosis. Podocyte function and proteinuria Podocyte function is abnormal, with reduced expression of nephrin and altered glomerular permeability. Proteinuria further promotes tubular injury and interstitial fi brosis. Reninangiotensin system Local renal renal artery stenosis activation l cell growth and matrix accumulation. Angiotensin II generates reactive oxidative species and NADPH oxidase in vascular smooth muscle and the Kidney. These may explain some of the additional benefi t of renal artery stenosis inhibition beyond blood pressure control. Genetics A poorly understood genetic predisposition appears to operate. diabetic nephropathy is more common in Northern Europe and the USA. Certain ethnic groups are affected more than others, e. g. Indo-Asians in the UK, African Americans, Pima Indians (astonishingly, by age 20, 7 50% of Pima Indians with Diabetes will have developed diabetic nephropathy, and 15% will have progressed to end-stage renal disease). diabetic nephropathy is more likely in relatives of diabetic patients with nephropathy. It is unclear why new cases of diabetic nephropathy are rare after 15 years of Diabetes. 610 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease Diabetic nephropathy: prevention, screening, and assessment Primary prevention Improve glycaemic control: Aim hemoglobin hemoglobin A1c 7%. 2 Clinical trials (e. g. DCCT and UKPDS) have consistently demonstrated the benefi ts of intensive Blood glucose control for primary prevention of diabetic nephropathy. Target blood pressure 130/80mmHg. Stop smoking. Encourage weight loss and exercise.

Management is essentially identical, however. diabetic nephropathy: PREVENTION, SCREENING, AND ASSESSMENT 611 Role of the renal biopsy in diabetic nephropathy A renal biopsy is rarely required to establish the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy but might be considered in certain circumstances: No diabetic retinopathy: Particularly in type 1 diabetes mellitus (retinopathy is observed in 85 99% of patients with established nephropathy). 7 30% of those without retinopathy will have an alternative lesion at biopsy (membranous glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, etc. ). type 2 diabetes mellitus patients have diabetic nephropathy without retinopathy more commonly. Note: this implies proper ophthalmic assessment, not just brief fundoscopy. Dysmorphic red cells, red cell casts, or macroscopic haematuria: Microscopic haematuria, usually to only, is seen in 7 60% patients with diabetic nephropathy. However, it will usually require independent investigation ( b p. 22). Rapid onset, rapidly increasing, or massive proteinuria. Conversely, a lack of proteinuria may cast doubt on the diagnosis and make histology desirable, e. g. possible drug-induced TIN ( b p. 580). Also consider renovascular disease in this situation ( b p. 586). Rapidly deteriorating glomerular filtration rate despite Good blood pressure and glycaemic control. Symptoms or signs suggestive of a multisystem disorder, e. g. vasculitis, connective tissue disorder, hepatitis C, HIV. Further investigation and assessment Urinalysis (? haematuria); quantify proteinuria ( b p. 21). serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, UE, serum albumin, hemoglobin hemoglobin A1c, lipid profi Blood. Consider serum and Urine Protein electrophoresis in older patients. Check visual acuity, fundoscopy, and arrange ophthalmology review, if not already under follow-up. Check blood pressure. Examine for other evidence of vascular disease (bruits, peripheral pulses, etc. ). Assess for peripheral neuropathy. ECG. Consider USS kidneys, esp. if microscopic haematuria (kidneys are often normal-sized in diabetic nephropathy despite d glomerular filtration rate). 612 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease Diabetic nephropathy: management Introduction Treatment goals: prevention of (i) progression from microalbuminuria (incipient diabetic nephropathy) to macroalbuminuria (overt diabetic nephropathy); (ii) progressive decline in renal function in patients with macroalbuminuria; and (iii) CV events. Glycaemic control X Unlike prevention, the effects of strict glycaemic control on progression from microto macroalbuminuria, as well as benefi ts for preservation of renal function, are more controversial.

Microvascular end points, including renal outcomes, were improved in both studies. However, primary CV outcomes were not improved by intensive glycaemic therapy and, in ACCORD, intensive treatment was associated with a 22% increase in all-cause mortality. So, more aggressive glycaemic management in higher risk type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (usually later in the course of their disease) delivered only a weak protective effect with respect to CV outcomes. Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative practice guidelines recommend maintaining hemoglobin hemoglobin A1c at 7%. However, some authorities suggest a target between 78% in patients with longstanding disease who are at higher CV risk. See b p. 894 for the use of hypoglycaemic drugs in chronic kidney disease ( (cid: 2) metformin! ). Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy often require conversion to insulin. Blood Hypertension i blood pressure is proportional to i albumin excretion. Numerous studies have demonstrated that treatment of blood pressure, irrespective of the agent(s) used, has a benefi cial effect on albuminuria. renal artery stenosis blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or ARBs confers an additional renoprotective benefi t, independent of blood pressure reduction. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or ARBs reduce the risk of progression of microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria (by 60 70%), reduce macroalbuminuria, and reduce the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate. 2 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or ARBs should also be used in normotensive patients with microor macroalbuminuria. Strict adherence to evidence would generally see angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor used in type 1 diabetes mellitus and ARBs in type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, most clinicians are pragmatic and principally guided by tolerability. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor also demonstrably reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, CVA, and CV death (by 7 25% at 2 years). This might be true for ARBs as well. Allow ≥ 25% change in serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Greater increases may indicate the presence of renal artery stenosis (a 70% renal artery stenosis is present in 7 15% of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and i blood pressure).

DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY: MANAGEMENT 613 A Low-salt diet ( b p. 259) enhances the renoprotective effects of ARBs in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, lower urinary sodium excretion, refl ecting lower intake, is associated with fewer CV events. Target blood pressure: Uncertain. In the UKPDS, a 12% risk reduction in diabetic complications was found with each 10mmHg drop in SBP, with lowest risk at 120mmHg. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes recommend a blood pressure target of 130/80mmHg if 30mg/24h proteinuria. UK Renal Association (and NICE) also recommend 130/80mmHg. Recent guidelines for hypertension from non-nephrological bodies, e. g. ESH-ESC (2013), have suggested the evidence for a target of 130/80mmHg is not particularly robust and suggested a target SBP of 140mmHg for most hypertensive groups, including diabetics. Many nephrologists will aim 125/75mmHg if proteinuria 1g/24h. Add further therapy in a stepwise manner, selecting drugs according to the comorbidity profi Blood of the individual patient. Diuretics may enhance the anti-proteinuric effects of renal artery stenosis inhibition. Furthermore, volume overload is often an important driver of i blood pressure in diabetic nephropathy with renal impairment.

The ONTARGET study randomized 25, 000 patients with either CV disease or diabetes mellitus microvascular disease to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or combination therapy. No differences were seen in p outcome (composite of CV morbidity and mortality). There were differences in s outcomes: potassium (5. 5 millimoles per liter) and renal failure were signifi cantly higher for combined therapy. Subsequent post hoc analysis found doubling of serum creatinine, need for acute Dialysis, and death more frequently in the combined therapy group. Limitations: only 38% of subjects had diabetes mellitus, and only 13% microalbuminuria. A recent meta-analysis examined 33 randomized trials involving 68, 000 patients. 1 Dual blockade was not associated with d mortality. It was associated with an 18% decrease in CCF-related admissions (many studies included patients with cardiac failure). Importantly, it was associated with a 55% increased risk of i potassium, a 66% increased risk of d blood pressure, and 41% increased risk of renal failure. The VA NEPHRON-D study of losartan with or without lisinopril in type 2 diabetes mellitus with overt nephropathy (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 300mg/g and estimated glomerular filtration rate 3090mL/min) was stopped early (median 2. 2 years follow-up) because of safety concerns involving hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury. This was despite a non-signifi cant trend toward benefi t with respect to the primary and secondary end points (relating to progression of renal disease or death). However, there was no demonstrable difference in CV events. Overall conclusions, as the evidence currently stands: Combination therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker should be avoided. Maximizing the dose of either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker is the best current strategy. 1 Makani H, et al. (2013). Effi cacy and safety of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: meta-analysis of randomised trials. BMJ, 346, f360. DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY: MANAGEMENT 615 616 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease Diabetic nephropathy: management 2 Additional renal artery stenosis blockade There has been much interest in combination therapy for renal artery stenosis inhibition in diabetic nephropathy. For angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker therapy, see Box 8. 2, b p. 614. Aldosterone has been associated with progression of renal disease through increased fi brosis and proteinuria. Plasma aldosterone often decreases with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy, but levels eventually return to baseline in many ( 7 40%) a phenomenon termed aldosterone escape . The addition of the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone to a regimen including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker has an anti-proteinuric (and variable blood pressure) effect in both type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus. No studies have shown long-term benefi t for other endpoints. (cid: 2) There is a signifi cant risk of i potassium, particularly in patients with d glomerular filtration rate, and this often limits the utility of spironolactone in practice.",

Other interventions Treat dyslipidaemia: Aim fasting LDL 3. 0mmol/L. Statins are usually necessary (and demonstrably reduce cardiac events in diabetic patients). X Statins may reduce proteinuria and preserve glomerular filtration rate in overt diabetic nephropathy. The role of aspirin and other antiplatelet agents for primary prevention of CV events in patients with diabetic nephropathy is uncertain. However, if no contraindication, Low-dose aspirin (75mg od) is often recommended. Smoking cessation. Modest dietary Protein restriction (0. 8g/kg per day, b p. 208) may slow decline in glomerular filtration rate. X Some advocate a more stringent restriction to 0. 6g/kg/day in selected patients. DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY: MANAGEMENT 2 617 Novel treatments for diabetic nephropathy Better understanding of diabetic nephropathy has informed novel therapeutic strategies, particularly with respect to the downstream effects of hyperglycaemia (AGE formation, Protein kinase C activity, production of pro-fi brotic intermediates, endothelin activity, and infl ammatory pathways). Some show promise in both experimental models and clinical trials. In all cases, larger studies will be necessary to determine if short-term improvements (e. g. reduction in albuminuria) translate to overall improvements in diabetic nephropathy outcomes. Pyridoxamine. Is a member of the vitamin B6 family that inhibits AGE formation. It reduces mesangial expansion, decreases albuminuria, and slows serum creatinine rise in animal models. Clinical studies suggest promise for early intervention in diabetic nephropathy. Experimental agents that prevent AGE cross-linkage or inhibit AGE and AGE receptor (RAGE) interaction are also under development. Ruboxistaurin. Is a selective Protein kinase C inhibitor that reduces albuminuria (albeit with no signifi cant difference for other renal outcomes) in type 2 diabetes mellitus diabetic nephropathy. Pirfenidone. Is an antifi brotic (via d TGFB production) and a free radical scavenger under investigation in several clinical contexts, including diabetic nephropathy. It reduces mesangial expansion and collagen gene expression in animals. Clinical trials suggest it may improve glomerular filtration rate but not albuminuria. T ranilast is another antifi brotic agent that has shown benefi cial effects in animal models and clinical trials. D oxycycline may also have antifi brotic properties and has been shown to reduce proteinuria. Sulodexide. A glycosaminoglycan, inhibits TGF-B production and causes dose-dependent reductions in albuminuria (persistent after discontinuation). Early clinical trials vs placebo have been disappointing. Avosentan. Is an ET-1 receptor antagonist that reduces urinary albumin excretion at the expense of increased CV events (CCF and volume overload). Atrasentan also reduces albuminuria and is more selective for the ET-A receptor. It is associated with peripheral oedema but is less likely to cause frank volume overload. Further trials are awaited. The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is involved in numerous anti-infl ammatory and antioxidant pathways. Nrf2 knockout mice suffer worse nephropathy in experimental Diabetes. B ardoxolone methyl, a synthetic triterpenoid, induces Nrf2 and improves glomerular filtration rate (but with no change in albuminuria). Unfortunately, the international BEACON trial was stopped early, following excess adverse events in the treatment arm. Diabetic mice lacking vitamin D receptors demonstrate renal artery stenosis upregulation, glomerulosclerosis, and increased urinary albumin losses. The administration of an active vitamin D analogue p aricalcitol has been shown to signifi cantly ameliorate this albuminuria.",

Neurogenic bladder (diabetic cystopathy) A degree of bladder dysfunction is present in 7 40% of patients with long-standing Diabetes. It results from peripheral and autonomic neuropathy (characterized by segmental demyelination with impaired conduction). The fi rst manifestation is usually loss of sensation of bladder fi lling, with subsequent progressive loss of motor function. Incomplete emptying leads to a large-volume bladder, with a signifi cant post-micturition volume and urinary stasis. Recurrent UTIs and urinary incontinence are common. Investigation: MSU for M, CS. USS bladder preand post-void. Ask the patient to complete a bladder diary. Urodynamic fi ndings include decreased bladder sensation, impaired detrusor contractility, and eventual detrusor arefl exia. Detrusor hyperrefl exia is also recognized. Screen for other manifestations of autonomic dysfunction, e. g. postural heart rate and blood pressure. Exclude signifi cant prostatic disease. Interventions include regular voiding in the absence of urge (e. g. every 2h), anti-incontinence aids to absorb Urine losses and protect skin integrity, assisted voiding (e. g. suprapubic manual Hypertension), drugs (e. g. the parasympathomimetic agent bethanechol) (benefi ts inconsistent), intermittent self-catheterization, (also d bladder volume and may help partial recovery of detrusor function), long-term catheterization, urinary diversion, and treatment of associated infection. Urinary tract infection ( b p. 706) with Diabetes have twice the incidence of UTI, compared to those without Diabetes. Diabetes is also a risk factor for UTIs in . There is also a higher incidence of pyelonephritis and renal abscess formation. 90% of cases of emphysematous pyelonephritis (b p. 711) occur in patients with Diabetes. Contrast induced-acute kidney injury (b p. 148) Patients with Diabetes, probably as a result of intrarenal microvascular disease, are more susceptible to CI-acute kidney injury. OTHER Diabetes-RELATED URINARY TRACT DISORDERS 619 Considerations in end-stage renal disease from diabetic nephropathy 2 Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (and selected patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus) should be considered for combined Kidney/pancreas transplantation (b p. 446). Diabetic patients often need to initiate Dialysis at an earlier stage than patients with end-stage renal disease from another cause, e. g. estimated glomerular filtration rate in the 10 15mL/min range, as they are often more symptomatic, tolerate volume overload less well, and have a heightened propensity to hyperkalaemia. Survival and causes of death in diabetic patients on Dialysis Diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease have a 5-year survival rate of 7 30% (compared with 76 0% in those without Diabetes). This is largely a consequence of their comorbidity, particularly CV disease. A higher incidence of withdrawal from Dialysis treatment is also reported. Dialysis modality: peritoneal Dialysis vs haemodialysis No clear difference in outcome between peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis has been observed. USRDS data and Canadian studies have offered confl icting results (potentially explained by different patient demographics and comorbidities). Overall, there is a suggestion that older diabetic patients survive longer on hemodialysis, and younger patients longer on peritoneal dialysis. Renal transplantation in diabetics Renal transplantation is safe and effective.",

    "text": "Renal transplantation in diabetics Renal transplantation is safe and effective. In appropriately selected patients, it can offer improved survival and rehabilitation, compared to Dialysis. Studies have shown similar 1and 5-year graft survival in diabetic and non-diabetic patients undergoing transplantation when data are censored for patients dying with a functioning graft. Living donor graft survival is superior to deceased donor grafts (80% vs 64% 5-year graft survival). 620 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease Plasma cell dyscrasias Introduction In this related group of disorders, bone marrow-derived malignant plasma cells produce abnormal immunoglobulin proteins that can cause renal injury by a number of mechanisms, including tubular blockage (e. g. myeloma cast nephropathy), direct glomerular injury (e. g. light chain deposition disease), immune complex formation (e. g. cryoglobulinaemia), and aggregation accumulation (e. g. AL amyloidosis). The four most important syndromes are: Myeloma Kidney (cast nephropathy) ( 7 30 65%). AL amyloid ( 7 20%). Monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD): Light chain deposition disease (LCDD) ( 7 10%). Immunotactoid or fi brillary glomerulopathy (rare). Cryoglobulinaemia (rare). Renal presentations of the plasma cell dyscrasias acute kidney injury: cast nephropathy, dehydration, i Ca2 , sepsis, drug-induced. chronic kidney disease: cast nephropathy, AL amyloid, MIDD. Proteinuria (or nephrotic syndrome): AL amyloid, MIDD. Tubular dysfunction (acquired Fanconi s syndrome, partial proximal and distal tubular defects): cast nephropathy, plasma cell infi ltration. What is in an immunoglobulin (Ig)? An Ig comprises two heavy chains (with a complement-fi xing site) and two light chains (with an antigen-binding site). Plasma cell dyscrasias may produce whole monoclonal Ig, whole light chains or heavy chains, or parts of either. This leads to the slightly confusing terminology surrounding the specifi c diseases caused by each Protein. Myeloma Kidney Multiple myeloma is a haematological malignancy caused by an excess of plasma cells. It is characterized by aberrant overproduction of monoclonal immunoglobulin (termed paraprotein or M Protein) plus associated light chains, either kappa ( κ ) or lambda ( λ). The most common class of whole immunoglobulin is IgG (followed by IgA then IgD). In some cases, only the associated κ or λ light chain will be identifi ed. The diagnosis of myeloma requires: A serum or Urine paraprotein. Clonal plasma cells occupy 10% of the bone marrow. End-organ damage unexplained by other pathology, e. g. i Ca2 , i serum creatinine, anaemia, or lytic bone disease (remember: CRAB ( b p. 624)). Incidence 7 40 pmp/year. 80% patients present aged 60 (although the diagnosis may need to be considered in much younger patients). . Renal involvement is a major complication of myeloma, present at (or preceding) diagnosis in 20 50% of patients, and in 50% of patients during the course of the disease ( 7 10% require RRT). PLASMA CELL DYSCRASIAS 621 Myeloma and acute kidney injury Myeloma has a propensity to injure the renal tubules, leaving patients vulnerable to secondary insults that cause ATN, such as volume d epletion and hypotension. In addition, reduced tubular fl ow will increase tubular light chain concentrations and further enhance tubular damage. Common causes of acute kidney injury Cast nephropathy (most common). ATN from sepsis, d blood pressure. i Ca2 causes dehydration and vasoconstriction. NSAIDs taken for skeletal Pain. Contrast-induced acute kidney injury. Drug-induced: diuretics, toxicity of myeloma therapy. When to suspect myeloma Any unexplained i serum creatinine/ d estimated glomerular filtration rate, esp. if associated with disproportionate anaemia (or anaemia that is refractory to erythropoiesis-stimulating agent therapy). Also d platelet or d WCC (marrow failure s to plasma cell infi ltration), immune paresis (reduction in all Ig classes), skeletal Pain (e. g. Low back).",

Advocated by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) for initial screening of plasma cell dyscrasias. 622 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease Myeloma: cast nephropathy Introduction The commonest form of renal involvement within the plasma cell dyscrasias (7 30 65%) and virtually always the cause (or a contributor) to severe renal impairment. Casts develop when the excess fi ltered load of light chains reacts with Tamm Horsfall mucoprotein (THMP) in the more distal tubule and forms an insoluble proteinaceous plug. This obstructs tubular fl ow, disrupts tubular architecture, and leads to progressive interstitial injury (which becomes rapidly irreversible). Cast formation is promoted by various properties of the light chain (e. g. charge in relation to tubular fl uid pH, binding avidity for THMP, propensity to aggregate), their concentration and promoting factors, such as dehydration. It is possible to have a very High light chain load without acute kidney injury. Pathogenesis and histology Cast nephropathy is characterized by eosinophilic acellular casts that have a distinctive fractured appearance (see Fig. 8. 1). These occur principally in the distal nephron (distal tubules and collecting ducts), leading to tubular epithelial cell death and luminal distortion. Casts are surrounded by infl ammatory cell infi ltrates (including macrophages and multinucleate giant cells), causing interstitial infl ammation, oedema and, inevitably, fi brosis. Casts are polychromatic, with Masson s trichrome positive for monoclonal light chain, and may stain with Congo red (although are not birefringent under polarized light).

Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain signifi cance (MGUS) Paraprotein 3g/dL. 10% plasma cells in the bone marrow. Usually does not have Bence Jones proteinuria. No evidence of end-organ damage ( CRAB ): Calcium: i Ca2 0. 25mmol/L (1mg/dL) above the upper limit of normal or 2. 75mmol/L (11mg/L). Renal insuffi ciency: serum creatinine 173 μ mol/L (1. 96mg/dL). Anaemia: hemoglobin 20g/L below lower limit of normal or 100g/L. Bone lesions: lytic lesions or osteopenia with compression fractures. Other: symptomatic hyperviscosity, amyloidosis, recurrent bacterial infections (2 episodes in 12 months). 7 3% of individuals aged 70 have MGUS. 7 1% progress to symptomatic myeloma each year. Risk factors for progression: higher paraprotein level, non-IgG paraprotein, and an abnormal SFLC ratio. A monoclonal Protein that can be characterized as a MGUS is not uncommonly found during the initial work-up of elderly patients with chronic kidney disease. This mandates surveillance, usually 6 12-monthly, with consideration of either a bone marrow biopsy or a renal biopsy or both if there is diagnostic doubt or evidence of progression. Where renal involvement is the prime clinical concern in this context, the term m onoclonal gammopathy of renal signifi cance has recently been coined. Asymptomatic (previously smoldering) myeloma Refers to asymptomatic patients, with paraprotein 3g/dL and a plasma cell infi ltrate 10% but no end-organ damage.

Median survival 10 years. end-stage renal disease in myeloma Mortality on Dialysis depends mainly on progression of the underlying myeloma, as patients survive as long as matched myeloma patients without renal failure. Early mortality is High (7 20% die within the fi rst 2 months), but mean 3-year survival is 7 30%. Patients who respond to chemotherapy do much better. MYELOMA: CAST NEPHROPATHY 625 Both haemodialysis and peritoneal Dialysis are feasible modalities. However, the main risk concerns susceptibility to infection (from the disease itself and its treatment), so continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis and Dialysis catheter-related sepsis can be severe. For this reason, an arteriovenous fistula should be fashioned as soon as recovery of renal function is unlikely (7 20% recover renal function with treatment, usually within the 3 months). The usual indications for commencement of Dialysis in chronic kidney disease/end-stage renal disease apply ( b p. 267), but patients may be symptomatic at a higher glomerular filtration rate in view of their comorbidities and 6 require an earlier start. In addition, progression to end-stage renal disease can be swift, with limited time for RRT education or psychological adjustment. 626 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease Monoclonal Ig deposition disease Introduction Monoclonal Ig deposition disease (MIDD) describes another clinicopathological variant of abnormal monoclonal light chain (or, less commonly, heavy chain) deposition, termed LCDD and HCDD, respectively. This is a similar condition to AL amyloid, but there are important structural differences, as the proteins do not organize into fi brils. LCDD is more common and usually caused by an abnormal κ chain, while μ or γ chains are usually responsible for HCDD. The clinical presentations of LCDD and HCDD are similar usually with nephritic-type glomerular injury: proteinuria (nephrotic range in 7 30%), microscopic haematuria, i blood pressure, and renal impairment (which may rapidly progress). May also present as chronic kidney disease. Renal involvement is often the fi nding that prompts a search for an underlying dyscrasia (usually myeloma, but Waldenstr ö m macroglobulinaemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and lymphoma are also associated). However, a malignant process may not fully declare itself despite prolonged follow-up. Light chain deposition disease (LCDD) A plasma cell dyscrasia causes tissue deposition of a monoclonal Ig light chain ( κ in 65%). Differs from amyloid, as the light chain lacks hydrophilic residues so cannot organize into fi brils (or stain positive for Congo red), forming granular deposits instead. The light chains have distinct properties, e. g. variants of the κ light chain variable region (types I and IV), infl uencing their deposition. Associated with overt myeloma in 7 50% (myeloma may subsequently develop). Bone marrow plasma cell expansion not always present. No monoclonal band on electrophoresis, and immunofi xation in 7 30% patients, but SFLC assays are signifi cantly more specifi c. Extrarenal features are less common than renal: cardiac (diastolic dysfunction, arrhythmias), hepatic (abnormal LFTs, hepatomegaly), and nerves (neuropathy). Histological features on renal biopsy: Extracellular matrix accumulation causes nodular glomerulosclerosis (Congo red n egative ), with glomerular and tubular basement membrane thickening. This appears similar to diabetic Kimmelstiel Wilson changes (b p. 608). Can be an MCGN injury pattern. Immunostaining is positive for monoclonal light chains in capillary walls, basement membranes, and mesangium.",

When this aberrant Protein is an immunoglobulin or light chain (usually λ ), it is known as primary or AL amyloidosis. In secondary amyloidosis, the Protein is serum amyloid A (SAA), which is overproduced in chronic infl ammation. In less common hereditary forms, a variety of proteins are involved, including fi brinogen A A chain, transthyretin, and apolipoproteins AI and AII. Amyloid fi brils of all types are 8 12nm in diameter and always bound to the normal plasma Protein serum amyloid P (SAP). SAP appears to render the fi brils extremely resistant to degradation. Classically, amyloid deposits appear an apple-green colour on Congo red staining if viewed under birefringent light. AL amyloid The fi brils in AL amyloid are derived from either whole monoclonal Ig or, more commonly, from light chain (usually λ ).",

Annual incidence 7 10 pmp. Median age at diagnosis 7 65. Clinical features Depend on specifi c organ involvement, but systemic symptoms, such as malaise and weight loss, are common. Cardiac: restrictive cardiomyopathy ( 7 30%) and arrhythmias (these are the main cause of death). Liver: hepatomegaly (and splenomegaly) from infi ltration.

Nerves: sensorimotor neuropathy (may be painful), autonomic neuropathy (e. g. orthostatic hypotension, bladder dysfunction), and compression syndromes (e. g. carpal tunnel). Haematological: bleeding diathesis, associated with factor X or IX defi ciency. May manifest as easy bruising but measurement of patient, APTT, and often bleeding time are necessary prior to organ biopsy ( (cid: 2) esp. renal).

Renal transplantation is only possible if the plasma cell dyscrasia is in complete remission (recurrence in the graft is inevitable otherwise) and cardiac function remains acceptable. 630 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease Renal amyloid: AA amyloidosis AA amyloidosis AA amyloidosis results from the sustained elevation of the acute phase reactant serum amyloid A Protein (SAA). In developing countries, chronic infections account for the majority of cases. In developed nations, chronic infl ammatory autoimmune conditions, particularly rheumatoid arthritis, are now much more important. Prevalence is linked to that of underlying conditions, which vary according to geography. The overall post-mortem incidence of AA amyloidosis in western nations is 0. 5 0. 86%. Pathogenesis There are several isoforms of SAA: SAA1 and SAA2 appear to be most important for acute phase responses. They are HDL-bound apolipoproteins that i macrophage HDL uptake during infl ammation (through the displacement of apolipoprotein A1). The persistence of SAA is probably s to pro-infl ammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-A. Proteolytic cleavage of SAA then generates peptide fragments that aggregate into misfolded AA fi brils via an interaction with the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulphate. It remains unknown why only 7 5% of patients with persistent infl ammation develop AA amyloidosis; other factors (e. g. genetic, including SAA1 polymorphisms) are clearly important. Causes Chronic infl ammatory disease: Rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (7 40%). Psoriatic arthropathy, ankylosing spondylitis (7 30%). Reiter s syndrome. Beh ç et s syndrome. Infl ammatory bowel disease. Chronic infections: TB, leprosy. Osteomyelitis. Cystic fi brosis, bronchiectasis. Chronic ulceration. Malignancies: Renal cell carcinoma. Lymphoma, Castleman s disease. Familial: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Clinical features Renal: unlike AL amyloid, renal involvement is universal. Proteinuria (often nephrotic range) is typical, although a minority (10%) present with progressive chronic kidney disease, with no proteinuria (predominantly vascular amyloid deposition). Renal biopsy demonstrates both glomerular and tubulointerstitial involvement. Note: microscopic haematuria is present in 7 30% so is a much more common feature than in AL amyloid. Spleen: always involved (l hyposplenism l infection). Adrenals: abnormal adrenal function in 7 50%. RENAL AMYLOID: AA AMYLOIDOSIS 631 Liver: hepatomegaly. GI tract: present in more advanced disease (l motility disorders, malabsorption, bleeding). Cardiac ( 7 10%), skin, tongue, and nerve: much less common than in AL. Investigations Tissue biopsy is necessary to confi rm diagnosis. This is often a renal biopsy, but less invasive alternatives include salivary gland, subcutaneous abdominal fat, or rectum (positive in 80%). Immunostaining tissue for SAA Protein differentiates AA from other forms of amyloidosis in virtually all cases. CRP and ESR were used to monitor disease and response to treatment, but SAA is increasingly used for this purpose. 1 23 I SAP scintigraphy ( b p. 629). Prognosis Outcomes depend heavily on the control of underlying disease processes. Prognosis is better than AL amyloid but still guarded: 7 40% survival at 3 years, overall. Infection is the major cause of death. SAA concentration helps predict outcomes, as risk of death rises with the median SAA (10-year survival 7 90% if median SAA 10mg/L and only 7 40% if 10mg/dL). Outcomes have improved for those with end-stage renal disease (previously a signifi cant cause of death), although patients still have worse Dialysis outcomes than those with unrelated conditions. Renal transplantation can be considered if underlying disease is consistently controlled, as recurrent amyloid is surprisingly uncommon in this context. However, 3-year patient survival post-transplant is reduced (principally s to infectious and CV causes).",

Treatment Treat the underlying infl ammatory or infectious condition to prevent further amyloid deposition. Existing amyloid appears to regress in 7 50%, especially if SAA is maintained 10mg/L. Infectious disease: antimicrobials and or surgical intervention, as indicated. Chronic infl ammatory disease: several treatments have shown effi cacy in the infl ammatory arthritides and may be applicable to other situations. Alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil, have been shown to improve survival. Anti-TNF therapy, with infl iximab, etanercept, and adalimumab, are effective at lowering SAA production. Experience is growing with the anti-IL6 receptor antibody tocilizumab. Colchicine has demonstrable effi cacy in FMF, reducing febrile episodes and renal involvement. Mechanism of action is unclear but appears related to suppression of infl ammatory responses. X It has also been used, with variable success, in non-FMF patients with renal disease. Novel approaches: there is increasing interest in therapies that can interfere with fi bril aggregation and deposition, e. g. agents that disrupt the interaction of SAA with glycosaminoglycan or induce dimerization of SAP to provoke improved systemic clearance. 632 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease Renal amyloid: other forms Other forms of amyloidosis with renal involvement Inherited fever syndromes Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF): causes AA amyloidosis and is the most common inherited form. Inheritance is autosomal recessive, most commonly affecting Sephardic Jews, Armenians, and Turks. It is caused by a mutation in the M EFV gene encoding pyrin, a regulator of transcription for infl ammatory mediators, including IL-1. Periodic acute attacks (of variable frequency) present before the age of 20, with fever ( 7 25% have fever alone) and serositis ( l peritonitis, pleurisy, synovitis) lasting 48 72 hours before spontaneous resolution. During the fl are: i WCC and i CRP. AA amyloid complicates 7 60% (Turks are at highest risk), and renal involvement is common. Colchicine 1 2mg/day is highly successful at reducing both fl are frequency and AA amyloidosis risk. It may also stabilize already established renal disease. Others: TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is autosomal dominant, with onset in childhood. Colchicine is less effective. Muckle Wells syndrome presents soon after birth, with daily episodes of rash, red eyes, and fever. Hereditary amyloidosis These are much less common than the AL or AA types. The inheritance of an abnormal gene leads to lifelong production of a potentially amyloidogenic Protein. Most forms do not present until middle age or later. They can be diffi cult to identify and may potentially be mislabelled as AL amyloid, particularly if there is a concomitant MGUS (common in this age group). Characterization of the amyloid type with immunohistochemistry is helpful, but genetic testing at specialist centres is diagnostic. Familial amyloid polyneuropathy: the commonest. Caused by mutations in transthyretin. Multiple mutations have been identifi ed, producing different clinical phenotypes. Predominantly a neurological disorder, but renal involvement is described. Fibrinogen A A -chain: the hereditary form with most renal involvement (almost exclusively glomerular). Presents age 50. Combined Liver renal transplantation is a potential treatment option. Apolipoprotein AI: may present with hypertension and chronic kidney disease in middle age ( 9 cardiac and nerve involvement). Again, combined Liver renal transplantation is a potential treatment option.

Several types have been described and may be encountered in different clinical scenarios and with different clinical consequences. Cryoglobulinaemia implies that circulating cryoglobulins are causing tissue damage. This may be s to hyperviscosity, immune complex deposition (with complement activation), or precipitation in small vessels, with thrombosis and downstream ischaemia (typically in cooler extremities). The overall prevalence of cryoglobulinaemia is unknown but strongly tied to that of hepatitis C (HCV) ( b p. 686). It is more common in . Cryoglobulins may be present in otherwise healthy individuals, so prognosis will depend on both disease activity and disease associations. Renal manifestations are associated with a worse outcome. Classifi cation Classifi ed according to their constituents. Type I cryoglobulinaemia (20%) The result of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (usually IgM, then IgG IgA light chain) and often associated with lymphoproliferative disease (myeloma, lymphoma, CLL, Waldenstr ö m macroglobulinaemia). Type II (or mixed essential) cryoglobulinaemia Usually monoclonal IgM, complexed with the Fc portion of polyclonal IgG. This monoclonal IgM autoantibody is a type of rheumatoid factor (any antibody directed against another antibody is termed anti-idiotypic and possesses rheumatoid factor activity). Associated with HCV ( b p. 686) and other infections (including HIV, HBV, and syphilis) as well as autoimmune disease (e. g. SLE, Sjö gren s syndrome).

HCV enters host cells (hepatocytes and CD5 B cells) via the LDL receptor infected B cells are resistant to apoptosis and exhibit increased production of autoantibodies. Type III cryoglobulinaemia Similar to type II, but this time polyclonal IgM is directed against IgG. Type III is also associated with viral infections and autoimmune disease and may evolve into type II over time. Clinical features Type I cryoglobulins do not fi x complement so may present with a hyperviscosity syndrome (acrocyanosis, retinal occlusions, Raynaud s, digital ulceration, livedo reticularis, purpura, arterial and venous thrombosis). Type II and III cryoglobulins cause systemic infl ammation. Consider cryoglobulinaemia in any patient with unexplained renal disease and a rash (skin involvement is virtually universal often a cutaneous vasculitis, with infarcts and ulceration), particularly if systemic symptoms, such as Fatigue and myalgia, are present. Also neuropathy, arthralgia, GI involvement, and lung involvement (pulmonary infi ltrates and haemorrhage). CRYOGLOBULINAEMIA 635 Renal involvement occurs early in up to 60% cases, usually presenting as the nephritic syndrome with acute kidney injury. Renal biopsy reveals an MCGN-type pattern of injury ( b p. 550). Investigation Complement components ( b p. 41). 2 Screening test for types II and III: High titre of rheumatoid factor plus Low C4. Cryoglobulins: the Blood sample needs to be transported at 37 C, ideally in a Water Rice. Speak to your laboratory. Type I cryoglobulins may precipitate within 24 48h, but II and III can take up to 7 days. Result is generally reported as cryocrit (the volume of precipitate as a percentage of original serum volume) and can be helpful for disease monitoring. The specifi c constituents of the cryoglobulin can be confi rmed by immunochemistry. Tissue biopsy, e. g. renal.

Treatment 2 Treat underlying condition, e. g. pegylated IFN-A and ribavirin for HCV. Immune suppression, typically corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, but increasing interest in rituximab (trials in progress). Plasma exchange: for hyperviscosity or severe disease, e. g. rapidly progressive acute kidney injury. Waldenstr ö m s macroglobulinaemia A clonal lymphoid and plasma cell disorder with overproduction of IgM monoclonal Protein. Multiple presentations: systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats), anaemia, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, neuropathy, hyperviscosity syndrome ( b p. 634), and cryoglobulinaemia. Renal involvement is uncommon but is glomerular (not cast nephropathy) when it occurs (microscopic haematuria, proteinuria, i serum creatinine). Histologically: glomerulonephritis with intracapillary thrombi and deposits from IgM aggregation. These stain for μ and κ chains. Cryoglobulinaemic features, MCGN, and amyloid may also be seen. Diagnosis rests on fi nding a monoclonal IgM Protein and 10% lymphoplasmacytic cell infi ltration of bone marrow. Treatment: plasma exchange for hyperviscosity, rituximab, alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil), purine analogues (e. g. fl udarabine), and stem cell transplantation are all possibilities. 636 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease Sickle cell nephropathy Introduction Renal involvement occurs in 7 60% of patients with sickle cell disease (HbSS) at some point during their life, although only 10 1 5% of these patients will develop end-stage renal disease. These fi gures are halved in individuals with the HbSC form of the disease. Heterozygous patients (HbSA) may develop tubular defects later in life, although they do not appear to be at a greater risk of developing chronic kidney disease. Pathophysiology The relatively hypoxic and hyperosmolar environment of the inner medulla promotes polymerization of deoxygenated haemoglobin S and subsequent sickling of erythrocytes.",

    "text": "This results in impaired renal medullary Blood fl ow, microinfarcts, and papillary necrosis. Alongside this, persistent anaemia and High cardiac output lead to glomerular hypertrophy and hyperfi ltration. Over time, the fi ne network of vasa recta is destroyed; the enlarged glomeruli become sclerosed, and chronic kidney disease ensues. Clinical presentation (and underlying cause) Polyuria and nocturia: Hyperfi ltration and poor medullary perfusion l hyposthenuria (inability to concentrate Urine under Water-deprived conditions). This is reversible (with Blood transfusions) until age 10 but becomes irreversible in later life, causing polyuria and dehydration. Metabolic abnormalities: SCN patients often have a partial form of distal RTA and a primary defect in the tubular secretion of potassium, resulting in a hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis and i potassium . In contrast, proximal tubular function appears to be supranormal, associated with i PO and B 2 microglobulin reabsorption and i 4 uric acid and Creatinine secretion. Proteinuria: In the majority of patients, prolonged hyperfi ltration leads to microalbuminuria, progressing to overt proteinuria over time. Although proteinuria is rare in individuals with HbSS disease aged 20, 7 60% aged 40 have an elevated urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio or urine protein-to-creatinine ratio. chronic kidney disease: glomerular filtration rate begins to fall from the 3rd decade onwards, leading to chronic kidney disease in a signifi cant number of patients (end-stage renal disease in 7 5 10%). Haematuria and renal colic: Medullary infarction and papillary necrosis can cause visible haematuria. This is usually self-limiting but can be painful and persistent. Hypertension: Uncommon in most patients with SCD (presumably the result of persistent vasodilation and dehydration). However, in patients with SCN and chronic kidney disease, i blood pressure is more prevalent and may contribute to a rapid decline in renal function. acute kidney injury: Occurs in 7 10% of those hospitalized with crises. SICKLE CELL NEPHROPATHY 637 Renal medullary carcinoma This aggressive malignancy is extremely rare but is found exclusively in patients with sickle cell disease or, more commonly, sickle cell trait. It can occur at any age from childhood onwards and presents with loin Pain, haematuria, and weight loss. Although patients are treated with surgery and chemotherapy, these are essentially palliative, as the disease is usually metastatic at presentation and fatal within a year. Investigations Although SCN is relatively common in patients with SCD, it is not the only cause of haematuria, proteinuria, or chronic kidney disease in these patients. Other conditions, such as lupus nephritis, HIVAN, or hepatitis Bor C associated nephropathy, need to be excluded. Routine, outpatient investigations: UEs, serum creatinine, urinalysis and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio/urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, FBC, reticulocytes, LFTs. New-onset haematuria: renal tract USS, Urine cytology; and consider computed tomography-IVU. Cystoscopy may be necessary in older patients as in the general population ( b p. 67). Heavy proteinuria or new-onset nephrotic syndrome: immunological and serological screen ( b p. 40). Parvovirus serology (may cause nephrotic syndrome after the acute infection). Renal biopsy may be necessary (particularly if rapid onset). Management There is no specifi c management for SCN, so treatment can be divided into the management of SCD and the management of proteinuric chronic kidney disease. SCD. Many of the complications of SCD, such as frequent crisis and severe anaemia, can be improved with regular hydroxycarbamide (HC) (also known as hydroxyurea). There is limited evidence from studies in children that early signs of SCN can be improved with HC therapy. Similarly, regular transfusion (9 exchange transfusion) can help mitigate many complications of the disease, although evidence for impact on renal disease is lacking.",

Patients with proteinuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 50mg/mmol) should be treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Start at Low dose because of the risks of i potassium and d blood pressure in this group. When taken at night, these drugs often also reduce nocturia. erythropoietin can improve hemoglobin and reduce transfusion requirement in some patients (target hemoglobin 80 100g/L), although High doses are often necessary. Heavy, visible haematuria should be treated with analgesia and IV hydration. It is usually self-limiting, but embolization may be considered for persistent, heavy bleeding. Dialysis and transplantation should be considered for all patients with end-stage renal disease. There appears to be a survival disadvantage on Dialysis for sickle patients (when age-matched to non-sickle patients). USRDS data show comparable graft function at 1 year but reduced patient survival (7 60% at 3 years). Recurrent transfusions may lead to sensitization with anti-HLA antibodies. Recurrent disease is common but usually mild. 638 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease The Kidney in systemic vasculitis Introduction The term vasculitis refl ects the underlying process: infl ammation and leucocyte infi ltration of Blood vessel walls. This may lead to local infl ammation (e. g. purpura), vessel wall damage (l aneurysm formation or haemorrhage), or vessel occlusion (l ischaemia and infarction). It is an autoimmune condition, but the precise causes are unclear. Both genetic (e. g. association with A 1-antitrypsin defi ciency and certain tyrosine phosphatase polymorphisms) and environmental factors (nasal S. aureus carriage, silica exposure, and certain drugs, e. g. propylthiouracil) appear important. The systemic vasculitides are classifi ed as small, medium, and/or vessel, according to the size of the smallest vessel affected (see Fig. 8. 3). The forms that most commonly involve the kidneys are discussed here (or elsewhere as indicated). Vasculitis: classifi ed according to the smallest vessel involved Large vessel: Takayasu s arteritis affects the thoracic aorta and its branches, presenting with i blood pressure, pulse defi cits, and ischaemic limbs or viscera (brain, Heart, lungs, gut). Giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) presents in older patients with headache, jaw claudication, visual symptoms, and myalgia. Medium vessel: Polyarteritis nodosa ( b p. 652). Kawasaki disease affects children, presenting as a febrile illness with lymphadenopathy, skin rash, conjunctivitis, and mucositis (lips, tongue). Small vessel: Without immune complex deposition: ANCA-associated vasculitis ( b p. 640). Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg Strauss). With immune complex deposition: Henoch Sch ö nlein purpura ( b p. 650). Cryoglobulinaemia (b p. 634). Cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis. Other forms of vasculitis may be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as SLE, RA, Sjögren s, and Beh ç et s.

Clinical surrogates that point towards GPA, rather than MPA, include upper airways symptoms or lower respiratory tract nodules and cavitation. Classifi cation Two classifi cation systems are used: (i) the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) criteria, and (ii) The European Medicines Agency (EMA) algorithm. Neither is perfect. The categorization of patients remains imprecise (and often clinically unnecessary). It has been suggested that a more simple classifi cation, based on anti-PR3 or anti-MPO positivity, may be more expedient (see ANCA, b p. 642). Does discriminating GPA from MPA matter? Perhaps not treatment is similar, and the clinical and serological presentations overlap, often enough to suggest that they may represent a disease spectrum, rather than distinct entities (see Table 8. 4). In the relevant literature, many studies group them together as a small vessel vasculitis. Table 8. 4 GPA and MPA discrimination GPA MPA ENT involvement Yes No ANCA specifi city c-ANCA (PR3) p-ANCA (MPO) Granulomata Yes (but not in the Kidney) N o Likelihood of relapse Higher Lower Incidence The incidence of MPA/GPA/RLV is 10 20 pmp per year (in Europe).

Lung ( 7 70% GPA, 7 30% MPA): capillaritis, causing pulmonary haemorrhage (may present as frank haemoptysis but can be incipient), 2 Pulmonary haemorrhage is exacerbated by even mild pulmonary oedema, so any degree of fl uid overload should be avoided.

Eight are organ-based, each including symptoms and signs typical for involvement of that particular organ in vasculitis, e. g. haematuria, proteinuria, and different categories of serum creatinine in the renal section.

Online BVAS calculators are available, although some training prior to their use is desirable. 642 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease ANCA-associated vasculitis: investigations ANCA During testing for ANCA, the patient s serum is tested for IgG binding to ethanol-fi xed neutrophils. Binding occurs in either: A cytoplasmic pattern (c-ANCA) (antibody usually confi rmed as anti-proteinase 3). A perinuclear pattern (p-ANCA) (antibody usually confi rmed as anti-myeloperoxidase). In fact, both PR3 and MPO are found in the same intracellular granules, so these staining patterns are actually useful artefacts of ethanol fi xation. Positive ANCA staining is then followed by specifi c assays for IgG binding to MPO or PR3 antigens (via ELISA or bead assay). (cid: 2) ANCA may also be positive in other infl ammatory and infective diseases, so always interpret in clinical context. This is particularly true of p-ANCA. Anti-MPO and anti-PR3 assays are usually negative or Low titre (other neutrophil antigens, e. g. lactoferrin or cathepsin, are the source of binding). Infl ammatory: SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, infl ammatory bowel disease, interstitial lung diseases, autoimmune Liver disease. Infective: HIV, TB, infective endocarditis. 7 10 15% of patients with clinical and/or histological evidence of GPA/ MPA/RLV are ANCA-negative at presentation (although some will become positive over time). The positive predictive value of a positive ANCA is dependent on the clinical situation: GPA: ANCA-positive in 80 90% ( 7 75% c-ANCA or anti-PR3). MPA: ANCA-positive in 80 90% ( 7 70% p-ANCA or anti-MPO). Other investigations 2 Urinalysis for haematuria (microscopic haematuria almost universal) and proteinuria, microscopy for red cells and red cell casts, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio. FBC (anaemia common, thrombocytosis, leucocytosis), serum creatinine, UE, LFTs, CRP (often raised). Consider Blood cultures. ABGs if suspected lung involvement. Other autoimmune serology: Anti - GBM: double positive ANCA and anti-GBM disease is well recognized and behaves like anti-GBM disease ( b p. 656). Anti-dsDNA, ENAs, C3, C4, rheumatoid factor to help exclude alternative diagnoses ( b p. 40). Imaging: Renal USS for renal sizes and to exclude obstruction. CXR or computed tomography may show patchy or diffuse alveolar shadowing. This could represent infection, pulmonary oedema, or pulmonary haemorrhage. Nodules, cavitation, pleural involvement, and reticulonodular shadowing may also be present in GPA. Transfer factor may be raised in pulmonary haemorrhage. ANCA-ASSOCIATED VASCULITIS: INVESTIGATIONS 643 Bronchoscopy may be desirable if pulmonary haemorrhage suspected but no defi nite haemoptysis. Bronchoalveolar lavage may reveal frank Blood or haemosiderin-laden macrophages. Renal biopsy is usually indicated. However, a positive anti-MPO or anti-PR3, in the context of rapidly progressive acute kidney injury, may mandate the immediate commencement of treatment prior to histological diagnosis. Renal histology A focal and segmental necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis is characteristic (see Fig. 8. 4). If small vessels, e. g. interlobular arteries, are sampled, they may show infl ammation and necrosis. Associated interstitial infl ammation is often present. Immunostaining reveals no, or very few, immune complex or complement deposits, 6 referred to as pauci-immune . Granulomatous infl ammation is not present in the Kidney in GPA (but often found in the upper airways and other tissues).",

    "text": "Chronicity, particularly the degree of irreversible glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fi brosis, will offer useful prognostic information. This may help to guide therapy. For example, aggressive and sustained induction therapy is not warranted in a patient with principally Kidney limited disease where a biopsy has suggested that renal recovery is improbable. ANCA and pathogenesis There is now a large literature confi rming that ANCA can activate neutrophils in vitro, leading to: (i) tethering and migration across endothelium; (ii) degranulation l proinfl ammatory cytokines l recruitment of monocytes and macrophages; (iii) augmentation of infl ammation and endothelial cell injury through free radical generation. This suggests that ANCAs are not an epiphenomenon (providing a useful clinical test), but that they contribute to pathogenesis. I n vivo confi rmation of this has been obtained with the demonstration of anti-MPO antibodies causing focal necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis following injection into mice. In addition, neonatal disease following placental transfer of anti-MPO antibodies has been described. It is likely that T cells specifi c for MPO and PR3 also contribute. Unanswered questions include: (i) how antibodies to MPO or PR3 arise; and (ii) how tolerance to self-antigens is broken. Transient induction of anti-PR3 antibodies has been shown during infection, and a possible infective association has been reinforced by the link between GPA and persistent S. aureus nasal carriage. 644 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease ANCA-associated vasculitis: treatment Both the disease and toxicity of therapy are associated with signifi cant morbidity and mortality. Risk vs benefi t should be assessed in each individual case and discussed with the patient. There has been a recent expansion in the literature regarding treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis (see Table 8. 5). For a full discussion on starting immunosuppression, particularly the necessary monitoring and preventative and protective measures (e. g. bone protection and PJP prophylaxis) that must be undertaken, see b p. 540. Induction therapy (to achieve remission) Corticosteroids: High-dose oral steroids (usually starting at around 1mg/kg prednisolone but rarely exceeding 60mg). Tapering regimens vary in different centres; possible regimens are shown in Table 8. 5. Table 8. 5 Suggested regimen for steroid reduction Week Dose Week Dose Month Dose 0 6 0mg 6 2 0mg 3 12. 5mg 1 4 5mg 7 2 0mg 4 12. 5mg 2 3 0mg 8 1 5mg 5 10mg 3 2 5mg 9 1 5mg 6 10mg 4 2 5mg 1 0 1 5mg 12 7. 5mg 5 20mg 11 15mg Cyclophosphamide: in addition to steroids. Daily oral therapy or intravenous or oral pulsed therapy. Pulsed therapy is as effective at inducing remission but may be associated with a higher risk of relapse. Switch to maintenance therapy between 3 and 6 months when remission achieved (minimum 3 months therapy recommended). Oral: 1. 5 2mg/kg/day (1. 5mg/kg if age 60) to a maximum of 200mg (round the dose to the nearest 25mg). Intravenous. Possible regimens: Ten pulses (15mg/kg) over 25 weeks, with age and glomerular filtration rate adjustments, or 0. 75g/m 2 every 3 4 weeks (initial dose to 0. 5g/m2 if age 60 years or glomerular filtration rate 20mL/min/1. 73m2 ).

ANCA-ASSOCIATED VASCULITIS: TREATMENT 645 Additional therapy for severe disease Severe disease may be defi ned (arbitrarily) as rapidly i serum creatinine, serum creatinine 500 μ mol/L (or Dialysis-dependent), or pulmonary haemorrhage. X Pulsed methylprednisolone: Three doses of 0. 5 1g IV over 3 days given initially. No direct evidence of benefi t and may increase complications. The MEPEX trial suggested that plasma exchange is more effective than pulsed corticosteroids in severe disease (increased survival at 3 months, increased independent renal function at 3 months, less end-stage renal disease at 1 year), but the additive effect of both treatments is not known. Plasma exchange: Indications: severe disease or coexisting anti-GBM antibodies. MEPEX regimen: seven exchanges (60mL/kg) over 14 days with 5% albumin. FFP or Octaplas may be needed at the end of the exchange if there has been a recent renal biopsy or there is pulmonary haemorrhage ( b p. 72). Ongoing PEXIVAS study should defi ne dosing/duration further. Resistant disease Failure to induce remission occurs in 7 10%. Therapeutic options: add rituximab to steroids and cyclophosphamide (or cyclophosphamide to steroids and rituximab). Commence plasma exchange. Consider IVIg (0. 5mg/kg/day). Polyclonal ATG or alemtuzumab (Campath ) have been used but lack an evidence base. Maintenance therapy (to maintain remission) Induction therapy usually moves to maintenance between 3 6 months. Low-dose prednisolone (see Table 8. 5). Convert cyclophosphamide to azathioprine 1. 5mg/kg/day (max 200mg). MMF 1g bd is an alternative in patients intolerant of azathioprine (but is associated with higher rates of relapse). It is not yet known whether MMF offers an alternative for induction therapy (MYCYC trial ongoing). The role of rituximab in maintenance therapy is not yet defi ned. Methotrexate may also be used but has a higher relapse rate and is generally not favoured for patients with renal or lung disease. Co-trimoxazole may reduce upper respiratory tract relapses in GPA and is used, in addition to standard immunosuppression. Most clinicians continue maintenance therapy for at least 2 years, often longer in GPA, but the optimal duration is unknown. The risks and benefi ts of ongoing treatment will depend on the individual clinical scenario and should be discussed with the patient. 2 Maintenance therapy is not recommend in patients who are Dialysis-dependent and have no extrarenal disease manifestations. Relapse rates are lower in patients with end-stage renal disease on Dialysis ( (cid: 2) but infection rates are higher). 646 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease ANCA-associated vasculitis: monitoring response and predicting relapse See Table 8. 6 for recent trials. Successful achievement and maintenance of remission may be monitored by: Clinical assessment: see Clinical presentation in ANCA-associated vasculitis ( b p. 641), but note that patients may not just have a recurrence of previous features they may develop new ones. Changes in BVAS score ( b p. 641). Presence/absence of urinary abnormalities: particularly haematuria (note: persistent proteinuria may not indicate persistent disease, rather irreversible glomerular damage). CRP: useful but non-specifi c. Poses a common clinical dilemma when raised; does it represent relapse or infection? (cid: 2) Both must be taken seriously. Stable or improving renal function. ANCA and anti-MPO or anti-PR3 levels. X Rising anti-MPO or anti-PR3 level may predict relapse, but this has not been consistent in all studies. There is currently no role for presumptively increasing immunosuppression in the absence of a change in clinical disease activity (although rising titres will usually mandate an increase in surveillance intensity).

    "text": "See Fig. 8. 4 for renal biopsy. Treating relapse Severe relapses should be treated, as per induction therapy. However, any decision to re-institute cyclophosphamide should be based, at least in part, on the cumulative dose to date, as there is evidence of a higher malignancy risk for cumulative doses over 36g. The preservation of fertility may also be a prime concern. Rituximab may be preferred in this situation. Less severe relapses require careful clinical judgement. Most clinicians will opt to avoid repeat cyclophosphamide therapy where possible. If relapse has occurred off maintenance therapy, then the re-institution of steroids and azathioprine (or MMF) may be suffi cient. ANCA-ASSOCIATED VASCULITIS 647 Renal replacement therapy Standard acute kidney injury indications for IHD or CRRT apply during the treatment of vasculitis (b p. 172). The development of irreversible end-stage renal disease will infl uence treatment choices (see Treating relapse, b p. 646). Transplantation: it is generally recommended that patients wait for 6 12 months post-remission prior to transplantation. Ongoing ANCA positivity per se is not signifi cantly associated with reduced graft survival. Recurrent disease can be expected in 15 20% but causes graft loss in a minority. A recent series of 7 100 patients suggested 70% graft survival at 10 years. Rejection rates are similar to the general transplant population, but there is an increased infection risk, presumably refl ecting cumulative immune suppression.

A small number are ANCA-positive. Clinical presentation Presents as a tetrad of skin rash, abdominal Pain, arthralgia, and renal involvement. Rash: skin manifestations usually dominate the clinical picture. Purpuric (usually symmetrical) rash, affecting legs, buttocks (and, less frequently, arms). Abdomen, chest, and face are typically spared. New lesions may develop over several months. Histology: leucocytoclastic vasculitis with vascular IgA and C3 deposition. Urticaria may also occur. Abdominal: GI manifestations in 7 3/4 patients. Nausea, Vomiting, diarrhoea (may be bloody), colicky Pain (which may be severe), GI bleeding, ileus, infarction, perforation, intussusception, pancreatitis, cholecystitis. Arthralgia: joint manifestations in 7 2/3 patients. Usually symmetrical polyarthralgia, mainly involving knees and ankles, wrists and fi ngers less common. True arthritis and permanent damage extremely rare. Renal involvement: focal and segmental mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis presenting as haematuria, proteinuria (which can be nephrotic range) 9 renal impairment and i blood pressure. A renal biopsy is usually reserved for nephritic/nephrotic presentations, renal impairment, and persistent or heavy proteinuria. The severity of renal sequelae is often not related to the severity of other manifestations Other: pulmonary haemorrhage, cerebral vasculitis (l headache, irritability, seizures, focal weakness, altered mental state), neuropathies, and orchitis. Prognosis Usually self-limiting (usually 1 month; rarely 2 months). Follow-up is recommended. Isolated microscopic (and intermittent macroscopic) haematuria may persist, but the prognosis is Good in this situation. i blood pressure is also probably more common. The presence of proteinuria is an adverse prognostic sign. HENOCHSCHÖNLEIN PURPURA 651 Nephritic and mixed nephritic/nephrotic presentations have the worse prognosis ( 7 1/3 will progress to end-stage renal disease). Estimated as the cause of end-stage renal disease in 7 1. 5 3% children overall. In adults, renal involvement is more common. Complete resolution is the norm, but persistent urinary abnormalities ( (cid: 2) proteinuria) predict a worse prognosis and mandate follow-up. Recurrence in 7 1/3 cases, particularly if renal involvement (usually within 6 months). Treatment Usually symptomatic only, e. g. analgesia for arthralgia. Severe skin or GI manifestations may require corticosteroids. Nephritis ( X no strong evidence base): Steroid treatment does not prevent renal involvement. Heavy proteinuria, impaired renal function, and crescents on renal biopsy often precipitate steroid treatment, e. g. 3 x doses of IV methylprednisolone, followed by 4 weeks of PO prednisolone. If the response is favourable, they are continued and weaned over 7 6 months. Some advocate the use of cyclophosphamide in this group. RPGN with 50% crescentic change is often treated as per other causes of systemic vasculitis (e. g. steroids, cyclophosphamide, and plasma exchange). angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for persistent proteinuria. HSP and IgA nephropathy: similar but (probably) not the same Whether HSP and IgA nephropathy are different faces of the same clinicopathological entity remains a matter for debate. Similarities: The extrarenal manifestations of both are similar. IgA nephropathy can occur in patients with a history of HSP and the two have occurred in the same family. Patients with HSP who subsequently receive a Kidney transplant may develop IgA deposits in the graft. Similar changes in the IgA system, e. g. aberrant glycosylation of circulating IgA, can be demonstrated in both. Differences: Age of onset is much younger in HSP. Extrarenal manifestations, especially cutaneous, are much more common in HSP. Glomerular, particularly mesangial, sclerosis is more common in IgA nephropathy, while endothelial proliferation is more common in HSP. On EM, deposits are mostly limited to the mesangium in IgA nephropathy but more widely distributed in HSP.",

Most cases are idiopathic, but 7 30% may be secondary (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, SLE, RA, Sjö gren s, hairy cell leukaemia). Onset is usually age 40 60. Symptoms and signs Usually presents with systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, arthralgia, and myalgia). Skin disease includes nodules, livedo reticularis, or purpura (indicating small vessel involvement). Medium vessel involvement in the gut presents as abdominal Pain (often postprandial), perforation, or bloody stool. Other features include testicular Pain (epididymo-orchitis), mononeuritis multiplex (peripheral neuropathy), stroke, and myocardial ischaemia. Renal ischaemia causes i blood pressure 9 renal impairment. There may be loin Pain from segmental renal infarcts. Unlike the ANCA-associated vasculitides, glomerular disease is not a feature of PAN. Investigations Urinalysis Inactive g enerally no microscopic haematuria (as no glomerular infl ammation), although proteinuria may be present ( i blood pressure). An exception might be the haematuria (often visible) that occurs with renal infarction with PAN). Routine laboratory tests FBC, biochemistry profi Blood with muscle enzymes. CRP is usually raised and may be used to monitor disease. Tests to exclude an underlying cause or alternative diagnosis Hepatitis B and C serology, C3, C4, RhF, ENAs, anti-dsDNA, cryoglobulins, Blood cultures (exclude infection). 2 PAN is not associated with ANCA. Diagnostic tests Diagnosis is made, following tissue biopsy or angiography. The classical fi nding is of microaneurysms or beading, with vascular occlusion in the renal or mesenteric vascular tree (see Fig. 8. 5). Renal biopsy may show segmental transmural fi brinoid necrosis in medium-sized arteries 9 downstream ischaemic changes or frank infarction. Management and natural history The prognosis of untreated disease is extremely poor. Treat underlying cause in secondary disease. In primary PAN, mild disease is generally treated with corticosteroids alone. Moderate to severe disease is treated with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide for at least 3 6 months, followed by azathioprine in a similar manner to ANCA-associated vasculitis. Relapses are infrequent. POLYARTERITIS NODOSA 653 Fig. 8. 5 Medium-vessel aneurysms in the kidneys at ateriography.

Takayasu s disease Chronic infl ammatory condition associated with granulomatous arteritis, intimal proliferation, and medial and adventitial fi brosis ( l arterial occlusion, post-stenotic dilatation, and frank aneurysm formation). Atherosclerosis supervenes as patients age. Affects large vessels principally the aorta (and branches) and pulmonary vessels. Aetiology unknown. Most common in young . Relatively common in Asia (esp. Japan). Rare in Caucasians (3 pmp). Classically described as a triphasic disease: (i) pre-pulseless phase with systemic symptoms; (ii) a vascular infl ammatory phase; and (iii) a quiescent occlusive phase. Presentation: systemic symptoms (weight loss, Fatigue, fever), claudication, angina, CVA, vertebrobasilar insuffi ciency, steal syndromes, aneurysms, asymmetrical blood pressure in limbs, bruits, aortic incompetence (if ascending aorta involved). 7 50% develop renovasular i blood pressure. Investigations: acute phase response (i CRP, ESR) and normochromic anaemia. Autoantibodies, including ANCA, are negative.

This is an ANCA-associated vasculitis (50% positive), but patients are generally younger patients than MPA/GPA/RLV (mean age 40). . Characterized classically by rhinitis, asthma, and eosinophilia and primarily affects the lung and skin. However, it may affect any organ. The incidence of renal involvement in EGPA is diffi cult to estimate (probably 7 30%). Symptoms and signs Disease typically evolves in stages (with some overlap): Atopic prodrome: 2nd/3rd decade. Allergic rhinitis or other atopic conditions. Asthma (often severe/steroid-requiring). Eosinophilic stage: Peripheral eosinophilia (1. 5 x 109 /L). Eosinophilic infi ltration of organs (esp. lung and gut). Vasculitic stage: 3rd/4th decade. Severe systemic vasculitis/extravascular granulomatosis. Presents as fever, malaise, weight loss. Widespread organ involvement includes: Lungs: i severity of asthma, dyspnoea, haemoptysis, pulmonary opacities/nodules, pleural effusions. Kidneys ( 7 30%): 50% with rapidly progressive acute kidney injury, 50% with isolated proteinuria/haematuria. i blood pressure is common (presumably renal ischaemia). Gut: eosinophilic gastroenteritis, ischaemic bowel, abdominal Pain, bloody diarrhoea. Skin: tender subcutaneous nodules, palpable purpura, urticaria. ENT: nasal obstruction, polyps, otitis media, hearing loss. Cardiac: coronary vasculitis (angina), myocarditis (LVF), or pericarditis ( (cid: 2) tamponade). Neuro: mononeuritis multiplex, painful polyneuropathy. Musculoskeletal: myalgia, migratory polyarthritis. Lymphadenopathy: eosinophilic LN seen in 30 40%. Investigations Urinalysis, (microscopic haematuria, proteinuria), microscopy for red cells and red cell casts, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio. FBC ( d hemoglobin) and prominent eosinophilia (often 10% total WCC, or absolute count 1. 5 x 109 /L). i ESR, u i CRP, immunoglobulins ( i IgE common and may vary with disease activity, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia). UE, albumin, LFT, CK. ANCA (usually anti-MPO) positive in 7 50% (particularly during vasculitis phase). RhF often positive at Low titre. CHURGSTRAUSS SYNDROME 655 CXR (fl itting, patchy infi ltration) 9 ABG. ECG, echo (consider cardiac MR with gadolinium if either abnormal). Lung transfer factor, HRCT, PFT (obstructive picture with d lung volume), BAL/lung biopsy. Tissue biopsy classically shows eosinophil-rich granulomatous infl ammation. If sampled, vessels show a small to medium vessel necrotizing vasculitis. Renal biopsy may show vasculitis 9 focal and segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis though usually with an eosinophilic infi ltrate and granuloma formation throughout the interstitium. A large series of 7 115 patients (all ANCA-positive) showed 50% had necrotizing glomerulonephritis on biopsy. Diagnostic criteria Lanham criteria (three criteria) vs American College of Rheumatology criteria (six criteria) from: Asthma. 10% eosinophils. Mono-/polyneuropathy. Migratory/transient CXR opacities. Paranasal sinus abnormalities. Biopsy containing a Blood vessel, with eosinophils in extravascular areas. Treatment Assess for severity using the fi ve factor score (FFS): (1) cardiac involvement; (2) serum creatinine 141 μ mol/L (1. 6mg/dL); (3) proteinuria 1g/day; (4) GI disease; (5) CNS involvement. Score 0 (no factors), 1 (1 factor), or 2 (2 factors). Prednisolone: PO 1mg/kg/day for 6 12 weeks (or until remission (consider initial pulsed IV if multi-organ involvement). Treat asthma and i blood pressure with standard therapy. 90% remission with steroids alone if FFS score 0. Eosinophilia is exquisitely steroid-sensitive and may resolve rapidly on treatment. Cyclophosphamide: PO or IV for 3 6 months, followed by maintenance therapy similar to ANCA-associated vasculitis (b p. 640).

Occurs in older children and adults of all ages but with peaks at age 20 30 and 60 70. More common in Caucasians. (slightly). Pathogenesis Caused by antibodies (usually IgG) against two adjacent regions in the NC1 domain of the A3 chain of type IV collagen ( Goodpasture s epitopes ). This A 3 chain is limited to the BM of the glomerulus and alveolus (also choroid plexus, testis, and cochlear although clinically irrelevant). The epitopes are usually structurally sequestered and 6 protected but become more accessible in the disease. It is now recognized that cell-mediated immunity is also important, with strong evidence from animal models and clinical studies that T cells reactive with type IV collagen contribute to infl ammatory responses. Genetic (e. g. HLA DR15, particularly the DRB11501 allele) and environmental (e. g. hydrocarbon exposure) factors infl uence susceptibility. Others risk factors include smoking and membranous glomerulonephritis (anti-GBM disease can occur before, during, or after this glomerulonephritis). Such factors appear to damage either the glomerular or alveolar BM l epitope exposure and autoimmune responses. There is no strong association with infection. Symptoms and signs Usually presents acutely with rapidly progressive acute kidney injury (with haematuria and subnephrotic proteinuria) 9 pulmonary haemorrhage ( 7 60%). Some patients report loin Pain and haematuria during early stages. No renal involvement is very rare. Pulmonary haemorrhage may present as frank haemoptysis but is often more incipient, e. g. cough, dyspnoea, Blood-fl ecked sputum. Pulmonary haemorrhage occurs almost exclusively in smokers and, more commonly, in younger patients. 2 Note: pulmonary haemorrhage is exacerbated by even mild pulmonary oedema, so fl uid overload must be avoided. Systemic symptoms, such as fever and weight loss, are usually absent and may suggest an alternative diagnosis, such as vasculitis. Investigations Routine laboratory tests Urinalysis for Blood and Protein, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (proteinuria usually non-nephrotic). FBC, UE, serum creatinine, CRP (often raised). Autoimmune serology Anti-GBM antibodies: request urgently if suspected. Titres broadly correlate with disease activity. False positives: viral infections, esp. HIV, hep C. False negatives unusual (diagnosis then rests on biopsy). ANCA: important differential diagnosis, and 25% are double positive for both anti-GBM and ANCA (usually anti-MPO). Such patients usually behave like anti-GBM disease but may have rashes and arthralgia. ANTI-GBM (GOODPASTURES) DISEASE 657 Imaging and investigation of pulmonary haemorrhage CXR 9 computed tomography (diffuse alveolar shadowing). ABGs. Renal USS to measure renal sizes and exclude obstruction. Transfer factor (KCO) may be raised if pulmonary haemorrhage. Bronchoalveolar lavage: frank Blood or haemosiderin-laden macrophages. Renal biopsy 2 Usually indicated but should not delay treatment if anti-GBM positive in the appropriate clinical context. Histology: focal and segmental necrotizing, crescentic glomerulonephritis. The light microscopic fi ndings are similar to those in ANCA-associated vasculitis, except that all crescents are usually at the same stage of development (termed synchronous ).",

Management Initial treatment is similar to ANCA-associated vasculitis, although maintenance therapy is generally not necessary, as relapse is very rare (anti-GBM is often referred to as a one-hit disease). For a discussion on starting and monitoring immunosuppression, see b p. 540. Corticosteroids: prednisolone (1mg/kg to max 60mg/day), and taper over 6 months, then stop (regimen will vary between centres). Initial pulsed methylprednisolone (three doses x 0. 5 1g IV) although limited direct evidence of benefi t. Cyclophosphamide: given in combination with steroids. Usually 3 months daily oral therapy (b p. 541). If anti-GBM remains positive, some clinicians then favour switching to azathioprine for a further period. Plasma exchange: should be given to all patients. Usually daily for 2 3 weeks, but duration can be tailored to clinical response and anti-GBM titre (aim: undetectable) ( b p. 950). Once Dialysis dependent, renal recovery is very unusual. Potentially toxic treatment may not be warranted in this situation (unless there is pulmonary haemorrhage), but features on the renal biopsy (see Investigations) should also inform this decision, as should potential future transplantation (see Prognosis). Prognosis Almost uniformly fatal if untreated. Independent renal function in 90% at 1 year when presenting serum creatinine 500 μ mol/L (5. 6 milligrams per deciliter); 82% when serum creatinine 500 μ mol/L (5. 6 milligrams per deciliter), and just 8% if Dialysis-dependent. Pulmonary haemorrhage signifi cantly increases early mortality. Transplantation is not recommended until anti-GBM antibodies have been absent for 6 months. If they persist, then further treatment (e. g. rituximab) may be contemplated. 658 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease Lupus nephritis Introduction Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous multisystem disease characterized by autoantibody production and a diverse range of clinical manifestations, as outlined in Table 8. 7. SLE is more common in black patients, Hispanics, and Asians. It principally occurs in young adults and is more common in by a factor of 7 10. Lupus nephritis should form part of the differential diagnosis in any patient presenting with an active urinary sediment 9 renal dysfunction. The diagnosis of SLE will not already be established in many patients. Renal disease is common in SLE, developing to some degree in 7 50% of patients and usually occurring within the fi rst 5 years of diagnosis. Surveillance is 6 important (and often performed by non-nephrologists). Pathogenesis The pathogenesis of SLE is multifactorial, involving genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. The strong genetic element is shown by 7 25 50% concordance in monozygotic twins and the fact that ≥ 10% of patient relatives are affected. Numerous abnormalities of the immune system have been described, although it is not universally understood whether these are epiphenomenon or causative. The hallmark of SLE is the production of a range of autoantibodies, in particular, to self-antigens that contain DNA and RNA. Factors that may promote autoimmunity include i IFN-A, increased levels of the B cell survival factor Blys (BAFF), and stimulation of nuclei acid-binding receptors TLR7 and TLR9. Immune complexes containing autoantibody cause tissue injury by stimulation of leucocyte Fc receptors and complement activation.",

Renal biopsy A renal biopsy is indicated in most patients with suspected lupus nephritis. 2 Note: severe disease may be seen histologically with a mild clinical phenotype (e. g. normal serum creatinine, mild proteinuria, and microscopic haematuria). Histology is crucial for planning of treatment and also yields important prognostic information. A complex range of light microscopic fi ndings may be present and classifi ed as shown in Table 8. 7. In all cases, immunostaining shows a full house, i. e. it is positive for IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, and C1q. Other renal pathologies also occur in SLE, including thrombotic microangiopathy (b p. 574), AIN ( b p. 580), minimal change ( b p. 558), and ischaemic nephropathy from renal artery stenosis (b p. 665).

    "text": "Classes III and IV (or III V and IV V) Immunosuppression is required for these categories. Class III typically presents as mild to moderate renal disease, with microscopic haematuria, moderate proteinuria, and (in a signifi cant number) deteriorating renal function. Extrarenal SLE is often active (see Fig. 8. 6). Class IV typically presents as severe renal disease: i blood pressure, oedema, active urinary sediment, deteriorating renal function ((cid: 2) often rapid), and nephrotic range proteinuria (extrarenal SLE is usually active). Class V typically presents as the nephrotic syndrome. The prognosis is worse if class V is found in combination with class III or IV. In the past, large doses of pulsed IV cyclophosphamide were used in addition to steroids (based on NIH evidence). More recent evidence has shown that: (ii) Low-dose IV cyclophosphamide is just as effective, and (ii) MMF is as effi cacious as cyclophosphamide for most patients. Standard initial therapy for most with classes III and IV disease is 6 High-dose oral steroids and oral MMF. Cyclophosphamide is generally reserved for patients who have failed initial treatment. Corticosteroids Most centres start with a High dose of oral prednisolone ( 7 1mg/kg, max 60mg od). Protocols for subsequent tapering will vary. See b p. 540 for possible regimen. Pulsed IV methylprednisolone (0. 5 1g IV x 3) is often given initially, although there is no direct evidence of benefi t although it may allow a lower dose of prednisolone to be used initially (e. g. 0. 5mg/kg the Eurolupus protocol ). Mycophenolate Given at a total dose of 2 3 g/day and normally continued at the maximum dose for at least 6 months. It is important to titrate the dose to these levels, as tolerated. Cyclophosphamide Usually reserved for patients who have failed MMF, although some clinicians still favour as initial therapy in more fulminant disease. Usually given as 6 x IV doses of 500mg at 2-weekly intervals. Rituximab Reserved for patients who have not responded to MMF or cyclophosphamide. Clinical trials in both extrarenal and renal lupus disappointing, but clinical experience suggests benefi t in selected patients. Belimumab (Anti-BLyS) C linical trials have shown benefi t in extrarenal lupus. Studies in lupus nephritis are ongoing. Class V The optimal therapy for pure membranous lupus nephritis is uncertain, as most trials have included only small numbers of such patients. LUPUS NEPHRITIS: INITIAL TREATMENT 661 If renal function is normal and proteinuria subnephrotic, immunosuppression may not be indicated initially. Spontaneous remission of class V disease may occur. Patients should be treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or ARBs, as for any proteinuric renal disease. If nephrotic range proteinuria, most clinicians would institute similar therapy to classes III and IV, as described previously. Calcineurin inhibitors are an alternative. Additional therapy All patients with lupus nephritis should receive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/ARBs, if signifi cant proteinuria, plus blood pressure treatment, as needed (aim 130/80mmHg). Treat complications of chronic kidney disease, e. g. anaemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism ((cid: 2) often neglected. SLE patients have High incidence of CV disease, so CV risk factors much be given appropriate attention. Hydroxychloroquine (200 400mg PO od) for all patients, unless contraindicated (demonstrably lowers disease fl are rates). Fig. 8. 6 Image from a renal biopsy of a patient with lupus nephritis.

Evidence of an initial response to treatment, with improving renal function and reducing proteinuria, can continue for many months. Nonetheless, although it is somewhat arbitrary, patients are categorized after 6 months treatment: Complete remission: urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 50mg/mmol, with a normalized or stable serum creatinine. Partial remission: urine protein-to-creatinine ratio improved 50% on baseline and 300mg/mmol, with a normalized or stable serum creatinine. Non-responders. Complete remission If MMF has been used, the dose may be reduced, although it is advisable to maintain a dose of around 2g/day for at least 2 years. Low-dose prednisolone (e. g. 5 10mg daily) is often continued. Azathioprine can be an alternative to MMF for remission maintenance if the latter is not tolerated (although recent trial evidence suggests that MMF is superior). Partial remission or non-responders The clinical decision-making process in partial responders can be challenging; options include continued observation (especially if parameters are improving), a further renal biopsy, or an escalation in therapy. Cyclophosphamide or rituximab may be considered. Cessation of immunosuppression There is no strong evidence to guide the decision to withdraw maintenance therapy. Case series suggest that the risk of relapse is inversely proportional to length of prior treatment. Therapy for at least 5 years is advisable. Monitoring Patients require close long-term surveillance. Monitoring for renal disease Urinalysis (particularly microscopic haematuria), urine protein-to-creatinine ratio or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. serum creatinine, serum albumin. If there is signifi cant proteinuria, serum albumin can be a more precise marker than urine protein-to-creatinine ratio and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (providing no other factors that depress albumin, such as infection, are present). Repeat renal biopsy. Monitoring lupus serology Anti-dsDNA, C3, C4, ESR, anti-C1q are useful for disease activity. One or more may be known to be particularly useful in an individual patient, but no single marker, or combination, has suffi cient sensitivity or specifi city to be used in isolation. LUPUS NEPHRITIS: FURTHER TREATMENT 663 (cid: 2) Some patients may have active serology but no clinical disease activity. However, those in whom the serological markers are negative are unlikely to have signifi cant activity (especially if previously positive). Prognosis Outcomes are variable and depend on disease severity and response to treatment. Overall mortality 7 10% at 10 years for lupus nephritis (approximately double that of non-renal disease). Chronic infl ammation, organ damage, toxicity of therapy, and increased CV disease all contribute to this. Renal replacement therapy SLE represents 7 1 2% of patients on an end-stage renal disease programme. Survival is comparable to patient without SLE. Lupus is generally quiescent once on Dialysis (a state of relevant immune suppression), although extrarenal disease fl ares may occur and require treatment. Interestingly, the better the quality of Dialysis (e. g. longer hours), the higher the risk of relapse. Patients are usually Good candidates for transplantation. It is recommended that disease has been inactive for 3 6 months at the time of transplantation. There is confl icting evidence concerning graft outcomes, with a historical suggestion that these may be poorer. However, this is probably not the case. Recurrent disease is relatively uncommon. Concurrent antiphospholipid antibody syndrome with graft loss from thrombotic events may contribute to the inferior outcomes seen in some series.",

SLE (7 30 40%), Sjö gren s (7 40%), RA ( 7 30%), systemic sclerosis ( 7 25%). They are also present in 7 5% of the normal population. As well as autoimmune diseases, antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with infections (e. g. HIV, hepatitis C, and syphilis) and drugs (e. g. hydralazine, procainamide, IFNA ). APS is defi ned as antiphospholipid antibodies plus one or more clinical episodes of arterial, venous, or small vessel thrombosis in any organ (confi rmed on imaging or histologically). APS occurs at all ages and is more common in . It is more frequent in relatives of affected patients. APS and fetal loss Defi nition used in pregnancy is antiphospholipid antibodies plus: One or more spontaneous abortion (10 weeks). One or more births 34 weeks, with severe pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, or placental insuffi ciency. Three or more unexplained, consecutive, spontaneous abortions 20 weeks gestation. Pathogenesis Dysregulation of coagulation l thrombosis. Exact mechanisms are unclear. However, it appears that aberrant apoptosis may expose membrane phosphatepholipids for binding by plasma proteins. These complexes then stimulate autoantibody production. Thrombosis is initiated by antibodies to coagulation factors (e. g. Protein C and S) 9 platelet and endothelial activation 9 complement activation. Clinical features Some patients are asymptomatic. In others, an associated disease will dominate clinical presentation, e. g. SLE. The presentation of APS essentially refl ects a multi-organ disorder, characterized by hypercoagulability and recurrent thrombosis: Vascular: DVT, physical examination, pulmonary hypertension, myocardial infarction, digital ischaemia. Obstetric: fetal loss, pre-eclampsia. Neurological: CVA, sinus thrombosis. Haematological: thrombocytopenia ( 7 30%), haemolytic anaemia. Skin: livedo reticularis, cutaneous infarcts, ulceration. Eyes: retinal vein thrombosis, amaurosis fugax. Other: adrenal infarction, avascular necrosis, Libmann Sacks endocarditis. Catastrophic APS (CAPS) is a rare, fulminant form, with rapid multisystem involvement and organ infarction. Mortality is High. ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME (APS) 665 Renal involvement Thrombotic microangiopathy ( b p. 574). Renal artery thrombosis and ischaemic nephropathy (b p. 586). Hypertension (including accelerated phase). Proteinuria. Increased risk of vascular thrombosis post-transplantation. Increased risk of vascular access thrombosis in haemodialysis patients. Laboratory tests for antiphospholipid antibodies Elevated levels of antibodies against anionic membrane phospholipids or their associated plasma proteins. Persistence is important for diagnosis of APS one or more of the following must to be present on at least two occasions, at least 12 weeks apart: IgG 9 IgM anticardiolipin antibody (IgG more commonly associated with thrombosis). Causes false positive syphilis serology. AntiB 2GP-I. Lupus anticoagulant ( (cid: 2) strongest risk for thrombosis). The lupus anticoagulant (LA) is directed against various plasma coagulation molecules and results in prolongation of clotting assays, including APTT, kaolin clotting time, and dilute Russell viper venom time (DRVVT). The presence of LA is confi rmed by mixing normal plasma with patient plasma. If there is a clotting factor defi ciency, mixing should correct the clotting time; when it does not, it suggests an inhibitor is present. Treatment Tailored according to presentation and prior history of thrombotic events. Asymptomatic individuals who are found to have antiphospholipid antibodies do not require specifi c treatment. However: Prophylactic therapy: Modify other risk factors: smoking, i blood pressure, i lipid. Avoid oral contraceptive. X Aspirin 75mg daily. Widely used in this context but benefi t unproven. Clopidogrel is an alternative if aspirin-intolerant. If SLE, consider hydroxychloroquine 200 400mg daily.",

Consider immune suppression (e. g. cyclophosphamide, esp. if associated connective tissue disorder). 666 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease Systemic sclerosis Introduction Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a heterogeneous autoimmune connective tissue disorder characterized by infl ammation, fi brosis, and vasomotor abnormalities. It is 7 5 x more common in , with peak age 30 40. On the basis of clinical presentation, organ involvement, and outcomes, it is subclassifi ed as follows. Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis Skin involvement is proximal to elbows and knees, and solid organ involvement is frequent. Characteristic autoantibodies: anti-Scl-70 and anti-RNP. More equal sex distribution. Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis Skin involvement is more distal, and solid organ involvement is unusual. CREST syndrome is an example. Characteristic autoantibodies: anti-centromere. Pathophysiology Dysregulated collagen synthesis and degradation, associated with multiple immunological (e. g. anti-endothelial cell antibodies) and vascular (e. g. aberrant vasomotor control) irregularities, leads to collagen accumulation and fi brotic cutaneous and visceral damage. Many cell types (including endothelial, fi broblasts, T and B cells, and macrophages), as well as cytokines (particularly pro-fi brotic IL-4, TGFB, and PDGF), contribute to progressive changes in the extracellular matrix and its constituents, including fi bronectin, proteoglycans, and various forms of collagen. Clinical presentation Patchy skin oedema, with eventual fi brosis and calcinosis, digital ulceration, periorbital tethering and microstomia, nasal beaking and tapering of the fi ngers (sclerodactyly), Raynaud s phenomenon, facial and limb telangiectasia, non-erosive arthritis, myalgia, oesophageal (and intestinal) dysmotility, pulmonary fi brosis, and pulmonary hypertension. Renal involvement Clinical presentations: i blood pressure and scleroderma renal crisis, chronic kidney disease (relatively common s to fi brotic renal change), drug-related, e. g. NSAIDs, systemic vasculitis (2%), SSc SLE overlap with lupus-type nephritis. serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, urinalysis ( 9 urine protein-to-creatinine ratio), and blood pressure should be regularly monitored in patients with SSc (e. g. 3 6 months). Patients should be encouraged to undertake home blood pressure monitoring. Scleroderma renal crisis A syndrome of acute kidney injury and accelerated i blood pressure in the context of SSc. It occurs in 5% of all SSc patients (15% diffuse disease; 1 2 % limited disease). It is the fi rst presentation of SSc in 7 20%. Pathogenesis Remains poorly understood, but endothelial injury with intimal thickening of intrarenal arteries l d renal perfusion and hyperreninaemia. Subsequent changes (including epithelial to mesenchymal transdifferentiation) within the glomeruli and tubulointerstitium promote renal injury. Endothelin-1 receptor dysregulation has also been observed. SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS 667 Risk factors Recent onset of diffuse disease, active skin disease, steroid use, positive anti-RNA polymerase. Clinical features and investigation New-onset signifi cant i blood pressure (e. g. 150/80mmHg) or blood pressure that is signifi cantly higher than a patient s own baseline. Can be asymptomatic, but accelerated blood pressure with multisystem involvement may be present ( b p. 518). Urinalysis, Urine microscopy, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio. Urinalysis is surprisingly bland but may reveal mild proteinuria 9 microscopic haematuria. i serum creatinine, d hemoglobin, d platelet, fi lm (?",

The annual incidence of RA is 7 3 cases per 10, 000 population, with a prevalence of 7 1%. Incidence increases with age (peaking age 35 50), and the disease is more common in . Renal conditions complicating RA Drug toxicity (esp. NSAIDs). Renal amyloidosis (AA amyloid). Secondary membranous nephropathy (membranous nephropathy). Other glomerular lesions. Rheumatoid vasculitis. Drug toxicity NSAIDs: see b p. 902. Methotrexate (see b p. 899): now the most commonly prescribed disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD). Usually not nephrotoxic per se at the doses used for RA. However, it is primarily renally excreted, and the need for dose adjustment is often underestimated. Best avoided if glomerular filtration rate 30mL/min. Gold (Sodium aurothiomalate): now rarely used. Caused proteinuria in 7 10% and associated with membranous glomerulonephritis. Penicillamine: now rarely used; associated with membranous glomerulonephritis in 7 15%. Anti-TNF biological agents (e. g. etanercept): use has rapidly expanded.

    "text": "They appear safe, but case reports of an association with glomerular lesions and vasculitis have emerged. Renal amyloidosis ( b p. 628) Usually a long history of poorly controlled active RA, with joint deformities. Often seropositive (RhF ve), with a grumbling acute phase response. Presentation is with proteinuria often in the nephrotic range. Membranous glomerulonephritis Presents with proteinuria (less commonly, nephrotic syndrome) and historically associated with DMARDs, particularly gold and penicillamine. Usually occurred within 6 12 months of commencement of therapy. Drug withdrawal usually leads to remission, but this may take up to a year. There are reports of membranous nephropathy in association with etanercept therapy. Other glomerular lesions Mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis is the most common renal lesion in RA patients who have undergone a renal biopsy ( 7 35%). An association with IgA nephropathy is also well recognized. These present with an active urinary sediment and (less commonly) renal impairment. A crescentic proliferative glomerulonephritis has been described in association with anti-TNF therapy. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS 669 Rheumatoid-associated vasculitis A small and medium vessel vasculitis, usually in RhF and anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated) antibody ve patients with long-standing disease. Other risk factors include sex and smoking. About 1 in 10 and 1 in 40 with RA developed vasculitis, although it is thought that this incidence is decreasing with improved treatment of severe RA. It is a severe multisystem disorder, associated with a High mortality. Clinical presentation may be with cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis, mononeuritis multiplex, digital ischaemia, and ulceration, or with gut, cardiac, or cerebral vasculitis. Renal involvement manifests as an active urinalysis with a rising serum creatinine. The renal lesion is a pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis ( b p. 643). Investigations include i CRP, i RhF, i anti-CCP antibodies. and d C3, d C4. 7 30% are p-ANCA-positive. Anti-TNF therapy has been successfully used for treatment, although it has also been implicated as a trigger in some cases (mechanisms unclear). Many clinicians treat as for ANCA-associated vasculitis ( b p. 644). Renal disease in other connective tissue disorders Renal disease is not uncommon, and monitoring of urinalysis, serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and blood pressure are an important consideration during follow-up. Sjögrens syndrome A multisystem autoimmune disorder that may be primary or arise in association with other connective tissue disorders, e. g. SLE, RA, or systemic sclerosis. Lymphocytic infi ltration of exocrine glands, particularly the lacrimal and salivary glands, causes sicca symptoms, such as dry eyes and dry mouth. Anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies are typical. Renal involvement in 7 20%. Manifestations: Distal (type 1) renal tubular acidosis ( b p. 824): May be partial or complete, with a tendency to nephrolithiasis. Impaired concentrating ability, with polyuria. acute kidney injury s to acute interstitial nephritis ( b p. 580): Generally steroid-responsive. chronic kidney disease (and end-stage renal disease) rare. Glomerular disease is uncommon. Mixed connective tissue disorder Associated with: Membranous nephropathy ( b p. 564) and MCGN (b p. 550). Lupus nephritis or scleroderma renal crisis may develop. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis Myositis and myoglobinuria may lead to false positive haematuria or, less commonly, acute kidney injury s to rhabdomyolysis ( b p. 152). Glomerular disease associations, e. g. mesangial proliferation, have been reported. 670 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease Sarcoidosis Introduction A multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown cause, usually affecting the respiratory system of young adults and characterized by non-caseating granulomas in involved organs.

    "text": "Pathogenesis Remains esoteric, although unidentifi ed antigen(s) appear to fuel dysregulated immune responses in susceptible individuals. Genetic predisposition is suggested by i incidence in monozygotic twins, family aggregation, and race distribution (i African Americans Scandinavians). Many immune response genes have been incriminated (e. g. cytokine polymorphisms), with specifi c alleles associated with particular clinical phenotypes. The culpable antigens remain anonymous, although several environmental and infectious precipitants have been proposed. In particular, mycobacterial species (with mycobacterial DNA isolated from 7 25% of sarcoid specimens), propionibacteria, and viruses. Various environmental triggers have also been postulated. It is unclear how this exposure results in such varied abnormalities of the immune response. CD4 Th cell activation and cytokine production (esp. IFNG, IL-2, IL-12, and TNF-A ) appear crucial (patients with sarcoidosis who acquire HIV do not progress their granulomatous disease). T cells exhibit a restricted TCR repertoire, suggesting oligoclonal expansion in response to a specifi c antigen. In addition, paradoxical peripheral immune anergy is evident during active disease, e. g. reduced delayed type hypersensitivity reactions. Histology Characteristic, irrespective of site: non-caseating epithelioid granulomas, comprising a central area of macrophages that differentiate into epithelioid cells before fusion into multinucleate giant cells. These are surrounded by CD4 T cells, with CD8 cells and B cells located peripherally. Unlike TB, necrosis is minimal. The nidus for granuloma formation may be partly processed antigenic material (e. g. microbial debris), and they are an attempt to seal off such material to limit tissue injury. Symptoms and signs Protean: sarcoidosis is the great clinical mimic of the post-syphilis European Renal Association. Classically presents with ≥ 1 of the following four: bilateral hilar adenopathy, pulmonary infi ltrates, skin lesions, and ocular involvement. Other: General: lymphadenopathy, fevers, weight loss, malaise. Chest: stage I bilateral hilar adenopathy; stage II adenopathy and infi ltrates; stage III interstitial disease with regressing adenopathy; stage IV pulmonary fi brosis. Eyes: uveitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, retinal vasculitis. Skin: pigmentary changes, lupus pernio, erythema nodosum. Cardiac: conduction defects, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy. Neuro: mononeuritis multiplex, aseptic meningitis, pituitary infi ltration ( l cranial DI); neurosarcoid may present as an MS-like illness. Liver: granulomatous hepatitis. Kidney: see b p. 671.

Serum ACE ve in 7 75% cases and useful for disease monitoring. Renal involvement Exact prevalence unknown. chronic kidney disease occurs in 7 1% of patients. Calcium metabolism Common. Activated macrophages within granulomas express 1A -hydroxylase and convert 25-(OH) vitamin D to active 1, 25-(OH) 3 2 vitamin D (calcitriol), particularly during sunny months (increased 3 substrate availability). This leads to i gut Ca2 uptake and l: Hypercalcaemia (10 20%). More common in older patients (esp. ). Hypercalciuria ( 7 50%). Calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis ( 7 15%). Nephrocalcinosis (which is associated with chronic kidney disease). Management: rehydrate. Steroids d macrophage calcitriol production. Consider d calcium (and oxalate) intake ( b p. 723).

This results in the widespread lysosomal accumulation of the glycosphingolipid substrates of A -Gal A, particularly globotriaosylceramide (GL-3). Progressive GL-3 accumulation in vascular endothelial lysosomes leads to extensive and progressive occlusive small vessel disease. Genetics The second most common lysosomal storage disorder (after Gaucher s disease), with a prevalence of 7 1 in 100, 000. The gene for A -Gal A is located on the long arm of the X chromosome (Xq22). More than 500 A -Gal A mutations have been identifi ed. Many lead to little, if any, A -Gal A activity (classic Fabry s disease), whilst others allow for residual enzyme activity (typically late-onset disease). The sons of affected will not have the disease, whereas all their daughters will be heterozygotes. 50% of the sons of heterozygotes will then be affected (whilst 50% of their daughters will also be heterozygotes). Heterozygous have a wide range of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic to severely affected (although symptoms tend to manifest later in life). Genetic counselling should be offered. Clinical features Often begin in childhood and adolescence. Skin: petechial-like angiokeratomas (appear as clusters of small red spots; classically umbilical, swimsuit region, and on extremities). Histologically, these are small, dilated veins of the upper dermis, covered by hyperkeratotic epidermis. Cardiac: occlusive coronary disease, conduction abnormalities, valvular disease, LVH. Lower extremity oedema (lymphatic glycosphingolipid accumulation). Neurological: painful acroparaesthesias (tingling, numbness, and stiffness of distal extremities particularly during a febrile illness), neuropathic Pain, autonomic dysfunction, hyperhidrosis, TIAs, stroke, vertebrobasilar insuffi ciency (ataxia, memory loss), tinnitus, hearing loss, depression. Ocular: corneal opacities (called verticillata) and dystrophy (visible on slit lamp examination). Pulmonary: cough, obstructive airways disease. Renal involvement: glomerular damage with proteinuria 9 microscopic haematuria. Progressive chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease (typically age 7 30 50). Renal abnormalities may be milder in heterozygote , e. g. isosthenuria, asymptomatic proteinuria however, 10% will progress to end-stage renal disease. FABRYS DISEASE 673 The underdiagnosed renal variant There is evidence that Fabry s disease is an underestimated cause of progressive chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. Measurement of A -Gal A activity in Dialysis patients suggests 0. 2 1. 0% have unrecognized disease.

Many other features of classical disease remain absent, although cardiac involvement can often be found on closer scrutiny. Theses individuals tended to have residual A -Gal A activity and 6 to have developed clinically overt disease later in life. Renal histology As well as in vascular endothelium, glycosphingolipid accumulation occurs in podocytes, mesangial cells, and, to a lesser extent, tubular cells (lipid-laden distal tubular cells are shed and can be seen on Urine microscopy). In later-onset variants, podocytes are more dominantly affected than other cell types. On microscopy, foamy inclusions may be seen in most cell types. Arteriolar sclerosis, glomerular atrophy and sclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fi brosis are common. Electron microscopy reveals characteristic lysosomal lamellar cytoplasmic (termed myelin or zebra bodies). Investigation Slit lamp examination. Lipid-laden epithelial cells on Urine microscopy. Reduced or absent plasma A -Gal A activity. Elevated serum GL-3 level. A -Gal A mutation analysis in equivocal cases. Treatment Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant A -Gal A has transformed management. Two preparations are available: agalsidase alfa (Replagel ) and beta (Fabrazyme ). Usually delivered as an IV infusion at 2-weekly intervals. (cid: 2) Extremely expensive. Infusion reactions are not uncommon. Neutralizing antibodies develop to the recombinant enzyme but do not usually appear to decrease effi cacy. Treatment demonstrably stabilizes and slows progression of disease, with clearance of accumulated GL-3 from capillary endothelial cells in kidney, skin, and Heart. Progression of chronic kidney disease is slowed. Initiate ERT at the time of diagnosis in adult patients. Timing will depend on clinical symptoms and evidence of organ involvement in heterozygote . ERT should be continued in end-stage renal disease patients for its non-renal benefi ts. Transplantation is feasible, as recurrent disease is also ameliorated by therapy. 674 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease HIV and renal disease Introduction Almost 40 million people worldwide are infected with HIV-1, and 7 30% of patients with HIV infection have a degree of renal dysfunction. As a result, HIV-associated Kidney disease has emerged as a relatively common cause of end-stage renal disease and HIV-associated mortality. HIV is associated with almost every described renal lesion (as well as many electrolyte and acid base disorders), either as a direct consequence of infection or as a result of the nephrotoxic profi Blood of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) medications (see Table 8. 8). HIV-related renal lesions can be classifi ed according to histopathological fi ndings. The most frequent are: classic HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), HIV immune complex Kidney disease (HIVICK), and HIV-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (HIV-TMA). However, many more glomerular lesions can occur that sit outside this framework. In addition, patients may develop glomerular disease related to concomitant HCV or HBV infection. 2 Patients with HIV infection are also more vulnerable to episodes of acute kidney injury (which has a higher mortality risk than non-HIV-associated acute kidney injury) as well as HIV-associated malignant lesions of the kidneys. Epidemiology Historically, HIVAN was the most common lesion associated with HIV infection in the developed world. However, the incidence has decreased with HAART.

It is almost exclusive to black adults. The University of Cape Town has developed a HIVAN classifi cation to enable standardization of terminology (see Table 8. 9). Prognostic indicators and outcomes have been evaluated using this classifi cation. Pathogenesis Transgenic mouse models suggest that expression of HIV genes alone is not suffi cient to cause HIVAN. Genetic factors ( MYH9, A polL1 genes two variants in the ApoL1 gene have been identifi ed as the susceptibility alleles responsible for most of the increased risk in black patients), unknown environmental factors, and host factors (e. g. RAAS activation) are also important. Viral proteins, such as Nef, induce podocyte dysfunction characterized by increased proliferation, apoptosis, and dedifferentiation. Others, including Vpr, induce apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells. As renal cells do not express classical CD4 HIV-1 receptors, it is unclear how virus enters the cells, although direct cell cell transmission appears important for infection of renal tubular epithelial cells. Histopathology HIVAN is characterized by the so-called collapsing variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (the capillary tuft literally crumples), with microcystic tubular dilatation, tubular atrophy, interstitial infi ltrates (often CD8 cells), interstitial oedema, and fi brosis. Immunostaining is non-specifi c. EM often reveals endothelial cell tubuloreticular inclusions and nuclear bodies. 2 These fi ndings should prompt serological testing for HIV. Symptoms and signs Proteinuria often with the nephrotic syndrome clinically. Renal impairment (usually superadded ATN). blood pressure is characteristically normal ( 7 80%), perhaps s to relative vasodilatation and renal salt loss. Oedema may be less marked than in other cause of the nephrotic syndrome, a phenomenon that is unexplained. Investigations Urine microscopy may show broad, waxy casts. urine protein-to-creatinine ratio proteinuria often heavy. i serum creatinine, UE (SIADH), d albumin. CD4 T cell count: Usually 200 cells/ μ L (but HIVAN has been reported in patients with higher counts). Renal prognosis is worse in patients with AIDS, especially if their CD4 count 50 cells/ μ L. HIV viral load: typically High (400 copies/mL). Hepatitis B and C serology. USS often shows normal or large echogenic kidneys.

Management of HIVAN HAART, a three-drug regimen of two reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus a protease inhibitor, has completely transformed the outlook for HIV-infected individuals. A diagnosis of HIVAN is considered as an indication for HAART, regardless of CD4 count. Continuous therapy is important to gain maximal benefi t: there is a High incidence of end-stage renal disease in patients whose treatment is interrupted through poor compliance. HAART exerts the following effects on HIVAN: Reduced proteinuria with full or partial remission of nephrotic syndrome. Delayed progression of renal impairment. Potential renal recovery and Dialysis independence angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/ARBs should be prescribed, as for any proteinuric renal disease (note: avoid calcium channel blockers if on protease inhibitors). Prednisolone has been used with some success, particularly when prominent interstitial infl ammation and i serum creatinine, but there is an absence of well-controlled trials. Ciclosporin has been studied in children. 678 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease HIV and renal disease: other lesions HIVICK Immune complex-related lesions are gathered under the term HIVICK. These resemble IgA nephropathy and diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (lupus-like). Pathogenesis As the immune complexes are generated by an HIV-induced immune response, an active viraemia is required. It is not clear why some patients develop HIVICK and some patients develop HIVAN, but both appear to be the consequence of a dysregulated immune response to HIV infection. In IgA type, IgA and viral antigen complexes deposit in the Kidney. Histopathology Mesangial change with mild/moderate hyperplasia and immune deposits. Large subepithelial deposits are seen with a ball-in-cup appearance. The diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (described as lupus-like ) has IgG, IgM, C3, and C1q immune deposits. Symptoms and signs Presentation can vary, although haematuria and Low-grade proteinuria are most common. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome are also recognized. Unlike HIVAN, the vast majority of patients are Caucasian or Hispanic, although affected Asians and black patients are described. Investigations Investigations, such as ANA and ANCA, must be interpreted with caution because false positives are more common in HIV-infected patients. Management Whilst HAART is established as the main treatment for HIVAN, it is unclear if other types of HIV-related Kidney disease derive as much benefi t from its use. The Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment (START) study is an ongoing trial investigating the impact of early HAART therapy on AIDS and non-AIDS conditions, including chronic kidney disease, and should help to answer this question in the near future. HIV-associated thrombotic microangiopathy HIV-TMA is associated with more advanced HIV disease and AIDS. It is another example of a renal lesion that has declined in incidence in the HAART European Renal Association (1% of HIV-infected patients).

Defi nitive diagnosis requires a renal biopsy. Patients with a High viral load (VL) require longer PEX therapy, compared to patients with a lower VL. HIV AND RENAL DISEASE: OTHER LESIONS 679 HAART-related renal side effects There has been a defi nite reduction in the incidence of HIVAN since the introduction of HAART medications; however, signifi cant evidence of nephrotoxicity associated with HAART has emerged. Common problems include: Protease inhibitors: Examples: indinavir, nelfi navir, ritonavir. Problems: crystalluria (may cause microtubular obstruction and ATN or lead to nephrolithiasis), interstitial nephritis. Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Examples: zidovudine, didanosine, adefovir, tenofovir. Problems: proximal tubular cell injury ( l Fanconi-like syndrome), lactic acidosis (often severe probably the consequence of mitochondrial DNA damage), acute kidney injury (ATN). Also associated with chronic kidney disease (itself the consequence of interstitial fi brosis). end-stage renal disease in patients with HIV infection In the USA and elsewhere, HIV-associated end-stage renal disease is an epidemic among black patients. The risk of end-stage renal disease in black HIV-infected individuals is 7 3 6 x higher than in Caucasian HIV-infected patients. Concomitant IVDU and HCV infection are important additional risk factors for end-stage renal disease. Despite the successes of HAART, longer overall survival in both black and Caucasian patients with HIV-associated chronic kidney disease has meant that the prevalence of end-stage renal disease is still increasing and remains associated with poorer survival (although this is improving). Dialysis Survival on either hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis appears comparable. HIV-infected patients undergoing haemodialysis do not require isolation. Transplantation Transplanting patients with HIV infection is a challenge in terms of infection rates, rejection rates, and attaining therapeutic and non-toxic levels of immunosuppression. However, in appropriate cases, it is thought to improve survival in comparison to Dialysis. Patient selection is crucial. Criteria: stable disease and antiviral regimen, compliant with medication, undetectable viral load, and preserved CD4 counts 200 cells/ μ L). In addition, drug interactions and toxicities are a major challenge. The largest series of HIV Kidney transplantations was published in 2010, with 150 performed over a 6-year period (including both live-related and deceased donor). Regimens were tacrolimusor ciclosporin-based, and some patients had ATG induction; 3 years follow-up. Rejection rates were High 31% at year 1, 41% at year 3. Graft survival was worse in comparison to the non-HIV transplant population, and increased numbers of neoplasms were seen. 680 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease Hepatitis B Introduction Approximately 1/3 of the world s population have been infected with HBV, and 7 350 million are chronic carriers. The majority of these are in the developing world, especially Africa and South East Asia where perinatal transmission is the dominant route of infection. The prevalence in the USA and Western Europe is 7 0. 1 0. 5% (placing them in the lowest WHO category), although this will vary considerably between particular communities. In the USA, it is estimated that there are 7 1. 3 million carriers (some estimates are much higher).

    "text": "The majority of these infections are acquired as adults, principally via sexual activity or IVDU. Although acute HBV infection rates have fallen ( l d IVDU, needle exchanges, behavioural change in the HIV European Renal Association, vaccination of the at-risk), the frequency of chronic infection is actually increasing because of migration from areas of High prevalence. The virus The HBV genome comprises partially double-stranded circular DNA linked to a DNA polymerase and surrounded by nucleocapsid and lipid envelopes. Embedded within these outer layers are the numerous antigens familiar from serological identifi cation of the disease. The illness In adults, an acute seroconversion illness follows 1 6 months after exposure. This ranges from asymptomatic (usual), through a non-specifi c viral illness, to a more severe illness with frank jaundice. Most adults develop immunity and clear the virus. The remainder become chronic carriers. Patients may alternate between active disease, where the immune responses cause Liver infl ammation, and an inactive carrier state. Carriers are at risk of hepatic (chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma) and extra-hepatic (e. g. glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, and reactive arthritis) complications. If HBV is acquired in childhood, chronic carriage is the norm ( 7 90%). This falls to 7 5 10% in adults (higher in the elderly). HBV serology explained The diagnosis and monitoring of HBV is based on the collective interpretation of several serologic markers ( HBV DNA Liver enzymes) (see Table 8. 10). HBsAg may appear ≥ 1 week post-exposure but usually ≥ 4 6 weeks. HBsAg positivity indicates that an individual is infected ((cid: 2) and 6 potentially infectious). HBsAg persistence (6 months) separates acute infection from chronic carrier status. Quantitative HBsAg testing is available, with lower levels associated with better host immune HBV control. Its utility for monitoring of therapy (esp. nucleoside/nucleotide analogues) is increasing. The immune response to HBsAg produces anti-HBs (as does vaccination). This usually persists indefi nitely. The fi rst antibody identifi ed is actually anti-HBc. IgM anti-HBc indicates acute infection and it may be the evidence of HBV acutely, before HBsAg and anti-HBs appear. Subsequent IgG anti-HBc persists indefi nitely (signifying either historical or ongoing infection). HEPATITIS B 681 HBeAg is a marker of viral replication ( (cid: 2) and 6 infectivity). Although HBeAg is often present acutely (suggesting i infectivity), that is not its main clinical utility. HBV within Liver cells may be in a replicating (i. e. virus-producing) and non-replicating (host DNA-integrated) form. As HBeAg is produced only during viral replication, it is an extremely useful marker of viral activity during surveillance of chronic HBV carriers. HBeAg disappearance and appearance of anti-HBe is termed seroconversion. This may occur during acute HBV or years later in chronic carriers. Seroconversion is Good news associated with d HBV replication, HBV clearance, clinical improvement, and favourable response to treatment. 2 General rule: ve HBeAg infectivity; ve anti-HBs immunity. HBV DNA estimates viral burden and viral replication. It can be quantitatively measured via sensitive protein-creatinine ratio assays. HBV DNA helps: (i) to determine recovery from acute infection; (ii) to distinguish inactive carriers from those with active disease; and (iii) to assess the appropriateness of antiviral therapy.

An association between HBV and IgA nephropathy has also been reported but may be coincidental, as IgA nephropathy is common in many populations. Minimal change, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and amyloid are also described. Pathogenesis Direct HBV renal tissue invasion does not occur (unlike HIV). Instead, viral and host factors (including genetic predisposition) play a role in glomerular immune complex deposition. These complexes comprise viral antigens and host antibodies, either forming i n situ in the Kidney or becoming trapped after circulation. The location of the immune deposit depends on its size, which, in turn, depends on the involved antigen. Investigations Full HBV serology and HBV DNA protein-creatinine ratio ( b p. 680). HCV and HIV serology. UE, serum creatinine, LFT. urine protein-to-creatinine ratio or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. FBC, INR. Full immunological screen may be required (b p. 40). USS Liver and kidneys. Renal biopsy. Membranous glomerulonephritis (membranous nephropathy) HBeAg antibody immune complexes are small enough to pass through the capillary basement membrane and deposit in the subepithelial space and cause membranous nephropathy. The clinical course of HBV-associated membranous nephropathy differs between children and adults. membranous nephropathy is common in children aged 2 12 years ( ), presenting with proteinuria. Usually HBeAg ve. Tends to remit spontaneously with seroconversion (i. e. clearance of HBeAg and development of anti-HBe). Proteinuria may persist for 1 year. Adults often present with a more chronic nephrotic syndrome and progressive chronic kidney disease in association with Liver disease. 50% will reach end-stage renal disease in 3 years. Mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis (MCGN) Immune complexes involving HBsAg are too large to traverse the basement membrane so settle in the subendothelial space. MCGN is more common in adults (membranous nephropathy in that age group), presenting with i blood pressure, heavy proteinuria, microhaematuria, and progressive chronic kidney disease (i. e. a more nephritic presentation than membranous nephropathy). Histology is similar to type I MCGN (b p. 550), with a tram track pattern some normal capillary loops with thin BM, others with split BM. Unlike MCGN with HCV, cryoglobulins are not present. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) Occurs within 4 months of HBV infection in adults, presenting as a medium-vessel vasculitis attributed to immune complex deposition ( b p. 652). ANCA ve. Relapse rare never once viral replication has stopped/seroconversion has occurred. Incidence appears to be falling along with the incidence of acute HBV. IgA nephropathy The Liver metabolizes IgA, so serum IgA levels increase in hepatic disease of any cause, potentially ending up secondarily deposited within the renal mesangium and capillary loops. Clinically signifi cant disease is rare. HBV-RELATED RENAL DISEASE 683 Treatment of HBV-associated disease in adults Cessation of immune complex formation requires treatment of HBV. Remission should follow seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe and a reduction in, or disappearance of, HBV DNA. Long-term nucleoside analogues are often used for this purpose (see below). Response rates are higher in membranous nephropathy than MCGN. Standard treatment of proteinuric disease with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker to achieve blood pressure 130/80mmHg and reduce urinary Protein excretion also applies. Immunosuppression should be avoided (l i viral replication 9 hepatic decompensation may occur on treatment withdrawal). PAN is a possible exception where severity of disease may necessitate steroid and cytotoxic therapy, with concomitant antivirals.",

Treatment of HBV-related Liver disease: a primer Decisions are based on HBV DNA, serum ALT, and assessment of Liver disease (including histology). Some guidelines have slightly different criteria, according to HBeAg status (with lower HBV thresholds in HBeAg ve individuals). In general, patients should be considered for treatment when HBV DNA levels are above 2, 000IU/mL ( 7 10, 000 copies/mL) 9 serum ALT is above the upper limit of normal, with evidence of active Liver infl ammation or fi brosis. Anti-HBV therapy (cid: 2) Much of the long-term data exclude renal patients. Treatment includes antivirals and immune modulators (to enhance host responses). Response rates are modest. Interferon alfa 5 million U x6 /week or 10 million U x 3/week SC for 4 months leads to undetectable HBV DNA levels and HBeAg clearance in 30 4 0%. 5 10% of patients relapse after treatment. SE: Fatigue, fl u-like illness (can be severe and debilitating), depression, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, GI upset, alopecia, transient Liver fl are at outset. Peginterferon alfa A 48-week regimen has similar effi cacy to interferon alfa. Peginterferon alfa 2a has an i half-life and a more stable plasma concentration, allowing fewer injections and better patient tolerability. Nucleoside/nucleotide analogues Associated with lower rates of HBe and HBs seroconversion. Most evidence for extra-hepatic manifestations lies with lamivudine. This inhibits viral polymerase, but effi cacy is limited by the emergence of drug-resistant mutants (7 15% per year). Usual dose 100mg PO daily, but (cid: 2) dose reductions for d glomerular filtration rate. Adefovir is also associated with resistance, and renal toxicity is recognized. Entecavir and tenofovir are potent antivirals, with Good safety profi les and a Low resistance rates thus far. Entecavir requires a dose adjustment, according to glomerular filtration rate, but has not been associated with renal toxicity so may be the treatment of choice in renal disease. Nucleoside analogues are usually continued indefi nitely, unless anti-HBe seroconversion is achieved. There is currently no strong evidence that combination therapy is superior. 684 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease HBV and end-stage renal disease Introduction There were multiple documented HBV outbreaks on haemodialysis units in the 1960s and 70s, and they occur sporadically to this day (usually because of poor infection control practices). Such historical outbreaks were associated with considerable morbidity and mortality among both staff and patients alike. By defi nition, Blood contact is not uncommon in this setting, and HBV is a tenacious virus e x vivo, remaining infectious on surfaces, even after drying, and requiring potent disinfection to inactivate. Prevention 3 The best means of controlling HBV-related renal disease is to prevent it. Offer immunization against HBV early in chronic kidney disease (b p. 685). Household contacts and family members of HBsAg-positive patients should also be immunized. Avoid sharing potentially Blood-contaminated items (toothbrushes, etc. ). Protected intercourse. Haemodialysis Haemodialysis patients are usually screened annually for HBV (and HCV) as well as on return from dialysing abroad. In the UK, 1% of the hemodialysis population are HBV-infected. HBV patients require isolation on haemodialysis units, in addition to standard universal precautions. Dedicated machines are used and dialyser re-use avoided. Peritoneal Dialysis is an option. Transplantation in patients with hepatitis B infection Transplantation is thought to offer a survival benefi t over remaining on Dialysis, but patient selection is crucial. Patients with evidence of active viral replication (HBeAg ve or HBV DNA ve) must be treated prior to transplantation and should remain on a nucleoside/nucleotide analogue post-transplant.",

    "text": "IFNA is an immune modulator and can provoke rejection if used after transplantation. In addition, patients who are HBsAg and/or anti-HBc ve should be considered for nucleoside/nucleotide analogue prophylaxis post-transplant. Most data in this context concern lamivudine (the dose of which should be adapted to glomerular filtration rate). HBsAg ve patients have about twice the mortality of non-HBsAg patients 5 15 years post-transplantation (probably partly due to reactivation of latent disease). Cirrhosis is a contraindication to renal transplantation. New acquisitions of HBV post-transplant can present with severe disease on immune suppression. HBV-related glomerulonephritis can recur/occur in transplants. HBsAg-positive Kidney donors It is acceptable practice to use HBsAg ve donor to HBsAg ve recipient, with using antiviral prophylaxis. However, the safety profi Blood is less clear when using an HBsAg ve donor for a recipient who is anti-HBs ve (i. e. potentially immune either as the result of prior infection or of immunization), as pre-existing immunity may not be suffi cient to overcome the viral load transferred with the transplanted Kidney in the presence of immunosuppression. X Small case series suggest that outcomes may be favourable. HBV AND end-stage renal disease 685 HBV vaccination in chronic kidney disease Patients who are likely to require renal replacement therapy (RRT) should be immunized against HBV a strategy that has been associated with a reduced incidence of HBV infection in Dialysis units. Despite the lower probability of HBV infection in peritoneal Dialysis patients (and patients destined for pre-emptive transplantation), there is suffi cient potential they may require haemodialysis at some point in their life that they should also be offered immunization. Patients should be immunized early in the course of progressive chronic kidney disease, as the proportion of patients achieving adequate anti-HBs antibody titres is lower, compared with the general population (and lower in advanced, compared with early, chronic kidney disease). Although it is desirable to know a patient s anti-HBc status beforehand (to prevent unnecessary immunization), HBV prevalence is so Low in many populations that pre-immunization screening may not be warranted. Local protocols will apply. Most HBV immunization schedules typically involve High doses or frequent doses (or both). Vaccines are generally administered IM (deltoid muscle), but the intradermal route may be more effective. Examples: Engerix B 40 micrograms at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months. HBvaxPRO 40 micrograms at 0, 1, and 6 months. Fendrix 20 micrograms at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months (X possibly more immunogenic). Response is assessed through measurement of anti-HBs antibody 8 weeks after course completion. 100mIU/mL was conventionally regarded as immunity ( responder ), but there is evidence that patients who have a lower (partial) response (10 100mIU/mL) are less likely to become chronic HBV carriers. Such partial responders (and those in whom anti-HBs titres diminish over time) should receive a further booster dose if the annual anti-HBs titre is 100mIU/mL. Non-responders (10mIU/mL) generally receive no further immunization, although some protocols give a further full course before accepting this status. 686 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease Hepatitis C-related renal disease Introduction HCV is an RNA virus with six different genotypes, causing hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and various extra-hepatic disorders. 150 170 million people are HCV-infected worldwide, with large geographical variation. Transmission is parental and associated with IVDU, accidental infection during healthcare (e. g. needle or multidose vial re-use, contaminated Blood products, or poorly sterilized instruments), and regional cultural practices. Perinatal and sexual transmission also occur but are less important than for HBV and HIV. Infection is mild (often subclinical), following an incubation period (6 9 weeks).",

    "text": "Infection is mild (often subclinical), following an incubation period (6 9 weeks). 70 85% fail to clear acute infection and become chronic carriers. Hepatitis C-related glomerulonephritis HCV is associated with several types of renal disease, predominantly: MCGN with mixed (type II) cryoglobulinaemia, membranous nephropathy (membranous nephropathy), and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Also recognized: focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, proliferative glomerulonephritis, fi brillary and immunotactoid glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy. Chronic HCV and associated mixed cryoglobulinaemia are now known to be the principal cause of type I MCGN (previously thought to be idiopathic). Renal involvement in some may be mild or clinically silent; in others, there is a signifi cant risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (worse if co-infected with HBV/HIV). HCV-related type I MCGN 2° to type II (mixed) cryoglobulinaemia Cryoglobulins are one (monoclonal) or more (polyclonal or mixed) immunoglobulins in serum that reversibly precipitate at 37 C ( b p. 634). Pathogenesis HCV-induced clonal expansion of rheumatoid factor (RhF)-expressing B cells in the Liver, lymph nodes, and circulation causes excess secretion of immunoglobulins (predominantly IgM kappa (κ ) directed against IgG, which is itself directed against HCV). These proteins (IgM κ, IgG, and viral antigens) aggregate into large cryoglobulins. HCV may also be responsible for type III mixed cryoglobulinaemia comprising polyclonal immunoglobulins (see b p. 634). The cryoglobulins deposit in small and medium-sized vessels in the skin, joints, and glomeruli, where they fi x complement and cause local infl ammation and injury. Prolonged clonal expansion of B cells can eventually lead to B cell lymphoma ( 7 5%). Pathology Renal biopsy shows a type I MCGN pattern of injury ( b p. 550). Light microscopy: glomerular hypercellularity, lobular accentuation of glomerular tuft, increased matrix and mesangial proliferation, splitting of capillary basement membranes (termed double contouring), intracapillary thrombosis (from cryoglobulin deposition), vasculitis, and fi brinoid necrosis. Immunostaining: deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 in the mesangium and capillary walls. HEPATITIS C-RELATED RENAL DISEASE 687 EM demonstrates large subendothelial deposits that may have a tactoid distribution/size pattern, characteristic of cryoglobulin deposition (measuring 15 30 microns, distinct from smaller fi brillary deposits measuring 12 25 microns). These are so large they may protrude into the capillary lumen, causing thrombosis. This appearance is different from idiopathic MCGN where the subendothelial deposits are much smaller (and more commonly encountered in children and young adults). Symptoms and signs 2 Usually a systemic disease. Extrarenal: Fatigue, weight loss, episodic purpuric rash (leucocytoclastic vasculitis on biopsy), arthralgia, myalgia, mononeuritis multiplex, Raynaud s phenomenon. Hepatosplenomegaly and stigmata of Liver disease. Renal: the Kidney is affected in 60%. Manifestations include haematuria, proteinuria (often nephrotic range), (i blood pressure, renal impairment (often progressive), and acute kidney injury (5%). In general, HCV-associated MCGN has a nephritic presentation, whilst membranous nephropathy is usually nephrotic. Investigations Urinalysis (haematuria, proteinuria) and microscopy (red cells casts).

    "text": "Membranous nephropathy is uncommon. Presentation, pathology, and outcomes are similar to idiopathic membranous nephropathy. It is thought to result from HCV-containing immune complexes depositing in the glomerular basement membrane (HCV can be demonstrated by i n situ hybridization). Cryoglobulins are not detected, and complements are normal. Antiviral treatment is usually recommended. HCV-associated PAN is well described ( b p. 652). It tends to be an acute, severe illness, presenting 2 years post-HCV diagnosis (with no cryoglobulins). Remission rates with treatment are High. Diabetic nephropathy: HCV infects pancreatic islet cells, causing reduced insulin production, and a post-insulin receptor defect also operates. Diabetic renal disease is 6 a consideration in long-standing HCV patients. 688 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease HCV-related disease: management Introduction Before the link between HCV infection and cryoglobulinaemia MCGN was discovered, treatments were similar to those used for other small to medium-vessel vasculitides namely corticosteroids, alkylating agents, and plasma exchange (to remove circulating cryoglobulins). Insight into the relationship between HCV and cryoglobulinaemia has led to direct treatment of HCV, with immune suppression now reserved for severe or refractory presentations. Several issues need to be considered prior to treatment: (1) viral genotype (some respond better than others); (2) degree of viraemia; (3) presence of chronic Liver disease; (4) severity of chronic kidney disease (and if Dialysis or transplantation is being considered); (5) extra-hepatic manifestations; and (6) other comorbidities (e. g. CV disease). If Liver status does not warrant antiviral therapy, then parameters favouring treatment for renal involvement are nephrotic syndrome, i serum creatinine, new i blood pressure, and the nature and severity of the injury on renal biopsy. If HCV viraemia is not present, the renal diagnosis should be reconsidered. No known therapy specifi cally alters renal outcome in MCGN, although antiviral therapy may clear HCV and have modest effects on proteinuria and renal function. Relapse of HCV RNA and cryoglobulins on cessation of treatment is common. Antiviral treatment The aim is to reduce or eliminate viraemia and decrease the formation of immune complexes. Patients with HCV infection are generally treated with peginterferon alfa (e. g. 180 micrograms/week) 9 the oral antiviral agent ribavirin (e. g. 1, 000 1, 200mg/day) for 24 48 weeks. (cid: 2) However, ribavirin is not recommended if glomerular filtration rate 50mL/min, and most studies have 6 excluded renal patients. There is some evidence that it is safe in haemodialysis patients. Treatment effi cacy is measured in terms of sustained virologic response (SVR) HCV RNA levels should be undetectable for a minimum of 6 months after cessation of therapy. Of the six known HCV genotypes, types 2 and 3 are more responsive than types 1 or 4, with SVR rates of 80% vs 45%, respectively. SE are common: for interferon alfa, see b p. 683); ribavirin: haemolysis and anaemia. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines for HCV treatment in chronic kidney disease chronic kidney disease stage 1 2: peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. chronic kidney disease stages 3 4: peginterferon alfa monotherapy. Haemodialysis: standard interferon alfa. Ribavirin ( 9 erythropoiesis-stimulating agent support) may be considered for all stages in specialized centres. See M Disease: Improving Global Outcomes. org/home/guidelines/ . HCV-RELATED DISEASE: MANAGEMENT 689 Additional treatments Adjunctive therapy should be considered for severe active disease (e. g. rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, severe neuropathy, widespread cutaneous vasculitis with ulceration). Antivirals will not deal with the circulating cryoglobulins already formed (PEX), and there may be an urgent need to target B cell production (rituximab) and attenuate tissue injury (steroids). Commencement of antivirals may need to be delayed until these goals have been achieved.",

The prevalence of HCV infection in hemodialysis patients varies widely (5 60%), infl uenced by factors, such as regional HCV prevalence, infection control techniques, and historical Blood transfusion screening. Standard universal precautions should always be undertaken, but HCV-infected patients do not require isolation on haemodialysis (unlike HBV) or to be dialysed on dedicated machines, as there is no convincing evidence that this affects transmission rates (although the European Best Practice Work Group have suggested it should be considered in centres with High HCV prevalence). ALT should be checked 6-monthly, with annual screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (USS and serum A -fetoprotein). Hepatitis C-infected patients and transplantation Renal transplantation may offer selected HCV end-stage renal disease patients superior survival and quality of life, compared to maintenance hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. It is important to assess the degree of Liver damage (usually with a Liver biopsy), and those patients with advanced disease, e. g. cirrhosis or portal hypertension, should be considered for combined Liver Kidney transplantation (single renal transplantation is contraindicated). Patients with active HCV will require antiviral therapy prior to transplantation, although treatment in chronic kidney disease and Dialysis patients is associated with Low sustained virologic response rates (7 20%) and signifi cant drug intolerance ( 7 30 50% of Dialysis patients stop treatment). (cid: 2) IFN-A treatment post-transplant is strongly associated with acute rejection (7 50%). Post-transplantation, HCV transplant recipients have inferior shortand long-term outcomes, compared to HCV patients. There is a signifi cant increase in early (fi rst 6 months) infection-related deaths. Patient survival at 3 years is 7 70%. 10 20% progress to cirrhosis within 7 5 years. The incidence of new-onset Diabetes post-transplant (NODAT) is higher in HCV recipients. HCV-related glomerular disease can recur/occur post-transplantation and is extremely diffi cult to treat (see Table 8. 11). HCV-positive Kidney donors X Rejecting organs from all HCV seropositive (potential) deceased donors will mean discarding organs from many who do not actually have active viral replication at the time. Limited experience suggests these kidneys may actually be acceptable for viraemic HCV recipients, although this risks superinfection with an HCV genotype from the donor that is different from the genotype of the recipient.

If left untreated, valvular insuffi ciency develops and is generally fatal. IE is mainly an infection of the left side of the Heart, involving the mitral or aortic valve (or both). Right-sided endocarditis is often associated with IVDU, but other risk factors include pacemakers, other cardiac devices, and central venous catheters. Common causes include S. aureus in acute IE or viridans streptococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci in more chronic IE. Renal dysfunction occurs due to a variety of mechanisms, including: Immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis. Aminoglycoside-induced acute kidney injury. Drug-induced AIN. Emboli (from infected valves). Renal abscess formation. Epidemiology In the European Renal Association of effective antibiotic therapy for IE, the incidence of renal complications has been variably reported (ranging from 2 to 60%). The severity of IE-associated glomerulonephritis is related to the duration of infection prior to the institution of antibiotics. Control of infection usually leads to rapid resolution, with recovery of renal function. However, irreversible renal damage may occur if appropriate therapy is delayed. Mortality is higher in those who develop renal disase. Symptoms and signs The manifestations of IE are not always classical and they are often very similar to those found in many other systemic diseases. 2 Suspect IE if fever, new murmur, splenomegaly, and haematuria (especially if known to have a valvular abnormality or prosthesis). Careful examination may reveal splinter haemorrhages (fi ngers and/or toes), although classical stigmata of IE are often absent. Microscopic haematuria points towards glomerulonephritis. A bland urinalysis is unusual suggesting an alternative diagnosis, e. g. aminoglycoside toxicity. Rash, eosinophilia, and a new fever after starting antibiotics may indicate AIN. Acute (unilateral) fl ank Pain and frank haematuria suggest emboli. This should prompt a search for evidence of emboli in other organs (check extremities). Infarction at the site of embolization is common; abscess formation is rare. Cerebral emboli occur in 7 33% of patients. Emboli may occur after microbiological cure . Investigations Repeated Blood cultures (and sensitivity testing) are the key to management. Use CRP to monitor treatment response. Echocardiography: transthoracic echo (TTE), but transoesophageal echo (TOE) has superior sensitivity. Daily ECG if suspected aortic root abscess.

It may be similar to post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis ( b p. 548) or MCGN (b p. 550), with hypercellularity (due, in part, to the infl ux of circulating infl ammatory cells) and immune deposits in the glomerular capillary wall. Fibrinous thromboemboli within arteries, with infl ammation of the adjacent renal tissue, may also occur as a consequence of septic emboli renal abscesses can form at these sites. Thrombotic microangiopathy with cortical necrosis can complicate severe sepsis. Acute tubular injury is a consequence of haemodynamic compromise (as well as nephrotoxic drugs (aminoglycosides or others). Treatment If glomerulonephritis, cure IE, using appropriate antibiotics. There is no role for adjunctive treatments, even if crescentic change on biopsy. If ATN, tailor aminoglycoside doses to levels or change antibiotic. IF AIN, change antibiotic. No role for steroids. Valve surgery may be required. MRSA glomerulonephritis MRSA glomerulonephritis presents either as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) and/or as nephrotic syndrome with various degrees of proteinuria, usually in the context of a severe MRSA infection. Normal complement levels and polyclonal elevation of serum IgG and IgA are often seen.

    "text": "(cid: 2) Data from the World Health Organization (2010) suggests that one-third of the world population has been exposed to TB and has at least latent disease. After lymph node involvement, the most common site of extrapulmonary TB is the genitourinary system (15 3 0% all cases). Renal dysfunction can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including direct infection of the Kidney or lower urinary tract, obstructive uropathy, tubulointerstitial nephritis, and secondary amyloidosis. Genitourinary TB (GUTB) Pathogenesis Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli are inhaled into the alveoli. Initially, the bacilli are locally contained by leucocytes and macrophages, but, over time, they are carried to regional lymph nodes and the thoracic duct before delivery into venous Blood and seeding of distant organs. In the kidneys, multiple granuloma form at the site of metastatic foci. These are typically bilateral, cortical, and adjacent to the glomeruli. They can remain inactive for decades. Active granulomas may grow to invade the calyceal systems, resulting in the spread of bacilli to the renal pelvis, ureters, bladder, and other genitourinary organs, including the epididymis and prostate. The renal medulla is preferentially affected, but subsequent papillary and pelvic involvement causes progressive scarring, calcifi cation, fi brosis, and chronic abscess formation. Extensive lesions will result in end-stage renal disease. Ureteral TB may cause strictures (can be extensive), hydronephrosis, and obstruction. Often unilateral. Symptoms and signs Classical TB symptoms, e. g. fever, weight loss, and night sweats, are uncommon. Pulmonary symptoms may be absent (although 7 30% will have an abnormal CXR). Symptoms are often non-specifi c, with 25% asymptomatic. It is 6 essential to maintain a High index of suspicion in those at risk. Abdominal (particularly back and fl ank) Pain, LUTS, recurrent UTIs that are poorly antibiotic-responsive, macroand microscopic haematuria, incontinence (bladder fi brosis), infertility in both sexes. Investigation Sterile pyuria (WCC on microscopy but negative culture) is characteristic (b p. 24). Three consecutive early morning Urine samples (EMUs). Microscopy for acid-fast bacilli on centrifuged Urine (Ziehl Neelsen stain) and culture on L ö wenstein Jensen media (takes 2 6 weeks). RENAL TUBERCULOSIS 697 EMUs for AFBs have a sensitivity of only 65% (although specifi city is 7 100%). More rapid results (1 week) with a radiometric culture system (BACTEC). protein-creatinine ratio for mycobacterial DNA can be helpful when available. It is a rapid test with High sensitivity and specifi city. UE ( d sodium s to SIADH), serum creatinine, LFTs, CRP, FBC, ESR. 2 Consider HIV testing. Tuberculin skin testing is usually undertaken; however, beware false positives in those patient vaccinated with BCG and false negatives in those on immune suppression. Plain kidney, ureter, bladder may show calcifi cation. IVU or computed tomography-IVU: abnormal (70 90%), with calyceal tip erosions ( moth-eaten calyx), pelvic distortion (e. g. the hiked-up appearance), strictures, fi lling defects, and calcifi cation. Renal tract USS if obstruction suspected. 698 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease Renal tuberculosis: TB-TIN and TB in patients with end-stage renal disease Tuberculous interstitial nephritis (TB-TIN) Pathogenesis A presumed immune-mediated process. TB causes a parenchymal reaction characterized by giant cells, tubulointerstitial infl ammation, and caseating granuloma formation. TB-TIN is a more insidious and less well-recognized form of renal involvement but is thought to be an underestimated worldwide cause of renal failure (e. g. in Asian patients presenting with advanced chronic kidney disease and small kidneys on imaging). Symptoms and signs Usually presents as chronic kidney disease in at-risk populations (esp. South Asians). Urinalysis is bland. USS shows normal or decreased renal sizes, usually with a smooth contour. EMU for AFBs are usually negative.",

Skin tuberculin testing is often positive. Diagnosis made on renal biopsy, although this may not undertaken if kidneys are small at presentation. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be identifi ed on tissue stain or paraffi n-embedded samples, although detection rates are often Low. Luciferase and fl uorescence technique improve sensitivity and can detect Low numbers of mycobacteria. Management Anti-TB treatment is associated with improved renal function, and recovery from even advanced chronic kidney disease has been reported. Cure requires combination therapy for 6 months. Compliance may be problematic and should be reinforced through Good patient education. The sensitivities of cultured M. tuberculosis should be confi rmed, but this should not delay initiation of treatment once the diagnosis has been secured. 2 Check local protocols for drug selection and dosing. 2 A dose adjustment is required for most agents if d glomerular filtration rate. Initial phase (2 months) Once-daily rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide (available in combination preparations, e. g. Rifater ). Add-on ethambutol or streptomycin if immunocompromised or previously treated for TB ( (cid: 2) isoniazid resistance). Continuation phase (further 4 months) Rifampicin and isoniazid. Notes Add pyridoxine 10 20mg daily (prevents the peripheral neuropathy associated with isoniazid). Check LFT before and 3-weekly during initial phase. Check visual acuity if using ethambutol (risk of irreversible optic neuropathy). If HIV-positive, prolonged multidrug treatment may be necessary. RENAL TUBERCULOSIS: TB-TIN AND TB IN PATIENTS WITH end-stage renal disease 699 X Corticosteroids, e. g. prednisolone 0. 5mg/kg for 2 months and weaned thereafter. This is poorly evidence-based. Theory: granulomatous infl ammation heals by fi brosis so reduce infl ammation to prevent secondary scarring. Generally reserved for those with severe 9 rapidly progressive chronic kidney disease. TB in patients with end-stage renal disease Dialysis patients have a signifi cantly increased (6 25-fold) risk of TB. end-stage renal disease is considered a state of relative immune compromise, mainly s to disruption of cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses. CMI response is primarily mediated by T cells, whose functions include the identifi cation and killing of intracellular pathogens, such as M. tuberculosis. Nosocomial transmission of TB in Dialysis units has also been reported. Risk factors include: older age, Asian race, smoking, malnutrition, and anaemia. The diagnosis in this population is diffi cult because disease is often non-pulmonary and symptoms may be non-specifi c. Diagnosis Tuberculin skin test consists of intradermal injection of tuberculin. In positive cases, a T cell-mediated delayed type hypersensitivity reaction causes a variable degree of induration within 48 72 hours. However, a High prevalence of anergy in Dialysis patients means that response rates are poor, so false positives are common. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) appear more sensitive and specifi c in this population. T cells from patients exposed to TB become sensitized to two proteins termed ESAT-6 and CFP-10. When these T cells are exposed to these antigens in the assay, they produce IFN-G, and the strength of this response can be quantifi ed. Note: IGRAs do not distinguish between latent and active disease. Examples include the T-SPOT TB test and the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-GIT)). IGRAs have now been included in the guidelines for the detection of latent TB infection in many countries, including the USA and UK. 700 CHAPTER 8 The Kidney in systemic disease Schistosomiasis Introduction Schistosomal infestation (a Water-borne trematode) affects as many as 200 million people worldwide and may lead to urinary tract disease or glomerulonephritis.",

    "text": "S. haematobium is endemic in most of Africa and the Middle East. It preferentially migrates to the venous plexus surrounding the bladder, causing lower urinary tract disease. S. mansoni (additionally found in Latin America) and S. japonicum (found in Asia alone) migrate to the mesenteric vessels or portal tree, causing hepatosplenic disease Pathogenesis Acute infestation tends to occur in childhood in residents of endemic areas but can affect travellers of any age. It is characterized by dermal invasion ( swimmer s itch ) and a subsequent systemic serum sickness-like syndrome ( Katayama fever ) with eventual maturation of a trematode in Blood vessels. Eggs released from mature worms cause delayed type hypersensitivity and granulomatous infl ammation in local tissues. Urinary schistosomiasis Caused by S. haematobium infestation. Presents with terminal haematuria (frank Blood at the end of micturition), dysuria, and frequency as a result of an infl ammatory cystitis. A quiescent, asymptomatic period follows that can last for decades. Late schistosomiasis occurs in 10 40% and may lead to progressive bladder fi brosis and detrusor failure. Ureteric stricture formation with obstruction is common (7 10%). Complications: recurrent bacterial infection, bladder calculi, chronic kidney disease (and end-stage renal disease) s to obstructive nephropathy, and an increased risk of bladder cancer. Investigations Typical live ova on Urine microscopy (centrifuge sample to improve yield). FBC (eosinophilia), UE, serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, LFTS. Serology: anti-schistosomal antibodies may be positive 4 8 weeks after exposure. They will not differentiate between past and active disease. However, a positive test in an individual who does not live in an endemic area can be helpful. protein-creatinine ratio for schistosome DNA is highly sensitive and specifi c on stool and Urine samples, if available. Plain kidney, ureter, bladder may demonstrate calcifi cation. USS to exclude obstruction treatment will often improve anatomical abnormalities in schistosomiasis, unlike GUTB ( b p. 696). Cystoscopy may show a nodular or polypoid lesions 9 ulcerating haemorrhagic cystitis. Schistosomal glomerulonephritis Complicates hepatosplenic disease in 7 10% patients with S. mansoni (less common with other species). Although the worms have developed strategies to evade immune recognition, if these are incomplete, an antibody response may result in circulating immune complex formation. These SCHISTOSOMIASIS 701 become trapped in glomeruli (esp. if Liver fi brosis has caused poor immune complex clearance), causing infl ammation and glomerulonephritis. Presents as proteinuria (often nephrotic range), haematuria, and impaired renal function. Several histological variants are recognized on Kidney biopsy, including mesangioproliferative, MCGN-like, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Co-infection with Salmonella may lead to a diffuse proliferative lesion (presents as the acute nephritic syndrome). Cryoglobulinaemia (usually concomitant hep C) and secondary AA amyloidosis are also possibilities. Treatment African Association of Nephrology (AFRAN) classifi cation (classes IV): Classes I and II respond to anti-helminthic therapy. Classes IIIV progress to end-stage renal disease in spite of therapy (75% progress to advanced chronic kidney disease or RRT over 4 6 years). Praziquantel 40mg/kg PO stat (80 90% cure rate). If S. japonicum, i dose to 60mg/kg in two divided doses. There may be some resolution of urinary tract lesions in urinary schistosomiasis (esp. if little fi brosis).

    "text": "acute kidney injury due to malaria can occur as part of multi-organ failure or as an isolated complication. The causes of acute kidney injury in malaria are complex and multiple. Histological fi ndings include ATN (most frequent), interstitial nephritis, and a proliferative glomerulonephritis. Glomerulopathy s to malaria is most common in childhood and adolescence, with glomerular lesions found post-mortem in 7 20% of patients with falciparum malaria. acute kidney injury 2° to malaria acute kidney injury complicates P. falciparum malaria in 1 4% cases but is more common in non-immune travellers ( 7 25%). If severe, 50% will require renal support, and mortality is 7 10% (partly due to non-availability of RRT). Although P. vivax is usually considered a benign parasite with a Low mortality rate, it can rarely cause severe disease with acute kidney injury. Pathogenesis Proposed mechanisms include immune-mediated glomerular injury, hyperbilirubinaemia ( l ATN), alterations in the renal and systemic haemodynamics, cytoadherence of infected RBCs ( l capillary obstruction), mononuclear cell infi ltration (l infl ammatory cytokine release), and increased release of both reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide. In addition, dehydration, haemolysis (l haemoglobinuria), DIC, and rhabdomyolysis may all contribute. Signs and symptoms Nausea, Vomiting, diarrhoea, malaise, headache, confusion, fevers, myalgia, jaundice (7 75%), and haemoglobinuria (blackwater fever). d blood pressure, peripheral vasodilatation, anaemia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Investigations Urinalysis and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (proteinuria usually 1g/24h). FBC (haemolytic anaemia), d platelet (70%). Thick and thin Blood fi lm for parasitaemia (usually 5%). Haptoglobins. DIC (APTT, INR, D-dimers). UE (d sodium in 50%), serum creatinine, CK, LFTs (hepatitis in 7 20%), and serum lactate (acidosis common). Management Manage patients with acute kidney injury in High dependency environment. RRT may need early initiation, as patients are highly catabolic. In addition, i potassium can be severe ( s to haemolysis, rhabdomyolysis, and acidosis). Supportive Blood products, as required. Culture Blood, and consider empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics (bacterial superinfection is not uncommon). MALARIA 703 IV quinine loading dose as 20mg/kg (max 1. 4g) over 4h, then 10mg/kg (max 700mg) IV over 4h qds for 7 days, with cardiac monitoring. Artemisinin derivatives clear parasitaemia more rapidly, act against more stages of the parasitic life cycle, and reduce mortality, in comparison to quinine, but are not widely available. Artesunate 2. 4mg/ kg IV fi rst dose, followed by 2. 4mg/kg at 12 and 24h, followed by 2. 4mg/kg once daily for 3 days, then oral therapy, as necessary. Doxycycline may be added. If the patient has G6PD defi ciency, seek expert help. X The role of exchange transfusion is controversial and reserved for High-burden parasitaemia. Potential benefi ts are quicker reduction of parasitaemia and a decreased risk of severe intravascular haemolysis. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) suggests it should be considered if parasite density is 10%, with evidence of end-organ complications. Glomerular involvement in malaria Transient nephrotic and nephritic illnesses may be seen during infection with P. falciparum and P. vivax. These glomerulopathies are reversible usually resolving within 2 6 weeks of treatment. The histological lesion is typically mesangial hypercellularity with mesangial and subendothelial deposition of IgG, IgM, and C3. Serum complement components may be reduced s to immune complex formation. Chronic malarial nephropathy (or quartan malarial nephropathy) is a different entity. It is the most common form of secondary glomerular disease in the tropics, causing nephrotic syndrome, mainly in children and adolescents. It is usually associated with P. malariae, occasionally P. vivax. The histological lesion is an MCGN-type pattern of injury, with subendothelial immune complex deposits containing IgG, C3, and (rarely) malarial antigens.",

A second infection is common in women who have had one UTI, but only 3 5% will develop recurrent UTIs ( b p. 710). In men and children, UTI is rare and almost always associated with urinary tract abnormalities that require further investigation ( b p. 708). Although serious morbidity from UTI is usually Low, renal scarring can result from sporadic or recurrent infections. Bacteraemia from a UTI can be a life-threatening medical emergency. UTI in pregnancy is discussed on b p. 842. Defi nitions Asymptomatic bacteriuria is the isolation of a signifi cant bacterial count in an asymptomatic patient ( b p. 710). Uncomplicated UTI is a symptomatic bladder infection (cystitis) in a with a normal urinary tract. Complicated UTI is a symptomatic infection of any part of the urinary tract in a with a functional or structural urinary abnormality. R e-infection is a recurrent UTI with the same or different organism, following clearance of the original UTI. Relapse refers to a recurrent UTI with the same organism that has not been adequately cleared. Pathogenesis In , the pathogens responsible for UTI are found in the colonic fl ora. Subsequent UTI is usually ascending, i. e. after perivaginal, perineal, and transurethral colonization, often triggered by intercourse. Lactobacilli, found as commensals in the vagina, prevent urinary pathogens from colonizing the perineum changes in the vaginal pH, use of spermicides, or antibiotic treatment may lead to failure of this defense mechanism. Host factors predisposing to UTI Female sex. Sexual intercourse. Use of spermicides. Urinary stasis or incomplete bladder emptying. Comorbidities, esp. Diabetes mellitus.

    "text": "Non-secretion of certain Blood group antigens (allows bacteria with specifi c adhesins to recognize urothelial cells). URINARY TRACT INFECTION: INTRODUCTION 707 Some women express an inherited and unique receptor on the urothelium that aids the binding of E. coli. Also, E. coli that expresses type P fi mbriae (pili), an adhesin that promotes bacterial attachment to the urothelium, is particularly likely to cause pyelonephritis. There are many other factors that have been suggested to contribute to bacterial virulence. Bacteriology Uncomplicated UTI Escherichia coli (70 90%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci ( S. saprophyticus ) (5 20%). Klebsiella spp. (1 2%). Enterococci (1 2%). Proteus mirabilis (1 2%). Citrobacter spp. , Enterobacter spp. , P seudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, group B streptococci (all 1% each). Complicated UTI E. coli remains the most common, but Proteus, Klebsiella, Citrobacter spp. , enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and group B streptococci account for a higher proportion. Symptoms and signs Cystitis or lower UTI Dysuria, frequency, urgency, nocturia, suprapubic Pain, or tenderness. Offensive Urine or frank haematuria. Ask about previous episodes of UTI, recent antibiotic use, pre-existing LUTS ( b p. 78), and, sensitively, about new sexual partners and spermicidal use. Vaginal irritation 9 discharge makes UTI l ess likely (vaginitis more so). 2 In the elderly, UTI may present as confusion 9 incontinence. Pyelonephritis or upper UTI Fever, chills, night sweats, rigors. Nausea, Vomiting. Loin Pain, costovertebral (renal) angle tenderness. May be systemically unwell, with progression to SIRS and shock a possibility. 2 In immunocompromised (and children), all of the listed symptoms/signs may be absent so maintain a High index of suspicion, esp. if unexplained fever. Diagnosis A pure growth of a urinary pathogen: ≥ 105 cfu/mL Urine remains the standard. However, at this cut-off, 30 50% of UTI will escape diagnosis. So, in addition, consider: ≥ 102 5 cfu/mL: in young women with suspected uncomplicated cystitis, children, , or if pyelonephritis possible. Bacteriuria ≥ 102 cfu/mL associated with signifi cant pyuria ( 9 symptoms) is usually signifi cant. Bacteriuria in the absence of pyuria almost always represents contamination. 708 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology Urinary tract infection: investigations and treatment Investigations Dipstick Urine: positive leucocyte esterase 9 nitrite reductase. Positive predictive value of 7 66% and a negative predictive value of 7 90%. May be modest haematuria or proteinuria. In Low-risk cases, no further investigation is needed if positive dipstick with characteristic symptoms. Clean-catch MSU for microscopy at x 40 magnifi cation (i. e. High-powered fi eld), pyuria (10 4 WCC per mL Urine) 9 organisms (see b p. 707). WCC casts strongly suggest pyelonephritis. Culture: sample should be cultured within 2h of sampling. If not possible, store at 4 (for 48h). Repeat Urine culture to confi rm eradication post-treatment is not recommended. A pregnancy test should be undertaken if appropriate. If suspected pyelonephritis: i WCC, i CRP, serum creatinine, UE. Imaging is only required in complicated cases, e. g. fever persists 48h despite therapy, clinical deterioration, poorly controlled Diabetes, immune compromised, systemic sepsis, recurrent episodes, stone former. computed tomography with contrast has become the investigation of choice and has superseded IVU. Stones should be excluded on the non-contrast images. computed tomography will identify changes on renal parenchymal perfusion, obstruction, perinephric collections or fl uid, and abscesses. USS is also useful and preferred by many clinicians as an initial investigation, as it does not involve radiation or contrast, and it will exclude obstruction with hydronephrosis. However, a negative USS does not exclude pyelonephritis, and ureteric abnormalities will be missed.

URINARY TRACT INFECTION: INVESTIGATIONS AND TREATMENT 709 Treatment Antibiotic selection and duration of therapy varies widely. Prescribing choice should always be informed by local antimicrobial resistance patterns. In general, broad-spectrum agents, such as co-amoxiclav, quinolones, and cephalosporins, should be avoided, as they increase the risk of antibiotic resistance (as well as C lostridium diffi cile ). Uncomplicated lower UTI (cystitis) For empirical therapy: Either: short-course (3 days) therapy: Trimethoprim 200mg bd (or co-trimoxazole 960mg bd). Or: longer-course (7 10 days) therapy: Nitrofurantoin 100mg bd (not in renal impairment). If second-line treatment is necessary, e. g. hypersensitivity reaction, side effects, failure of fi rst-line treatment, then Urine culture with sensitivity testing is recommended. Options: Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofl oxacin 500mg bd or levofl oxacin 250mg od. Oral cephalosporins often offer a useful alternative. Fosfomycin 3g single dose. Ampicillin/amoxicillin are less effective at eradicating vaginal and peri-urethral colonization. Encourage High fl uid intake, e. g. 2L/day. Complicated lower UTI 2 At-risk patients: , recent urinary tract instrumentation, recent antibiotics, Diabetes mellitus, immunosuppressed, obstruction, structural abnormalities, functional abnormality (e. g. neurogenic bladder, refl ux), foreign body, renal failure. Empirical therapy should be started immediately (e. g. fl uoroquinolones for 7 10 days), but antibiotic therapy should always be tailored against Urine culture and sensitivity results. Pregnant ( b p. 842). In the immunocompromised, consider additional single-dose aminoglycoside (e. g. gentamicin 3 5mg/kg IVI or IMI). For UTI in renal transplant recipients, see b p. 438. 2 Acute pyelonephritis Initial assessment will need to determine if treatment can be outpatient-based or whether admission is necessary (l nausea and Vomiting, systemically unwell). Suggestions (tailor against culture results): Fluoroquinolones (e. g. ciprofl oxacin 250 500mg bd PO) or levofl oxacin 250mg od for 14 days. Alternatives include co-amoxiclav IVI, then PO, or a third-generation cephalosporin IVI, then PO for 14 days. Consider additional single-dose gentamicin 3 5mg/kg IVI. Rehydration with 0. 9% NaCl. Appropriate analgesia and antiemetics. 710 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology Urinary tract infection: miscellaneous Asymptomatic bacteriuria Common (1% in young vs 7 20% in aged 80. Rare in ).

The long-term renal scarring and chronic kidney disease resulting from this early injury is called RN or c hronic pyelonephritis. 5 12% of the end-stage renal disease population in the developed world is generally considered to have RN (although the diagnosis is often presumed in a patient presenting with scarred kidneys). The main anatomical abnormality of the urinary tract is usually vesicoureteric refl ux (VUR), but RN can also occur with incomplete bladder emptying or outfl ow obstruction. The ureter inserts obliquely through the bladder wall, forming a compressible tunnel that acts as a one-way valve to prevent refl ux of Urine. A short or incompetent tunnel may allow refl ux of Urine into the ureters, as the bladder contracts during micturition. Superinfection is the norm. By late childhood, the bladder base thickens; the ureteric tunnel elongates, and free refl ux generally no longer occurs. Vesicoureteric refl ux Genetically heterogeneous but: Affects 0. 1 1% of newborns. Underlies 12 50% of children with a proven UTI. Is almost always present in children with proven renal scarring. It may be associated with renal dysplasia and hypoplasia (and 6 childhood i blood pressure, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease). Unilateral or bilateral (unilateral will not cause signifi cant chronic kidney disease). Ceases around puberty when anatomical changes mean that free refl ux is no longer possible. Essentially a radiological diagnosis, classifi ed grades I V by severity (see Table 9. 1). Surgical correction of incompetent valves offers no benefi t over simple antibiotic prophylaxis and prompt treatment of UTIs in terms of long-term outcome. Table 9. 1 Classifi cation of VUR Grade I Refl ux into ureter, with no dilatation Grade II Refl ux into ureter, pelvis, and calyces, with no dilatation Grade III Mild or moderate dilatation of the pelvis No, or only slight, blunting of the fornices Grade IV Moderate dilatation and/or tortuosity of the ureter and moderate dilatation of the pelvis and calyces. Complete obliteration of the sharp angles of the fornices but maintenance of the papillary impressions of most calyces Grade V Gross dilatation and tortuosity of the ureter, pelvis, and calyces Papillary impressions are no longer seen in the majority of calyce REFLUX NEPHROPATHY 713 RN: a new paradigm More recently, however, the belief that refl ux alone directly leads to renal scarring has been questioned. It is thought that VUR may simply be a marker of abnormal renal development, including renal dysplasia and hypoplasia. It is proposed that it is this abnormal renal development that predisposes to chronic kidney disease. Evidence: renal lesions may be present antenatally in the absence of infection, and treatment of childhood VUR-associated UTIs often does not alter long-term renal outcomes. RN may 6 be better thought of as the sequelae of a developmental abnormality (renal hypoplasia or dysplasia), with associated VUR. Clinical presentation In children, all UTIs should be subsequently evaluated for RN. In adulthood, the presentation is usually with unexplained chronic kidney disease. i blood pressure ( 7 50% of adults).",

Pregnant women with RN may develop UTIs, functional deterioration, or i blood pressure 9 pre-eclampsia and should be referred for specialist care. Investigations 9 9m Tc-DMSA scintigraphy (DMSA is taken up in functioning renal tubules) will demonstrate renal scars as areas of reduced uptake. IVU: classically renal scarring (as parenchymal loss) and clubbed calyces . Localized papillary scars do not take up contrast well, blunting the normal appearance of the renal calyx. In children, the gold standard for diagnosis of VUR is a micturating cystogram, although isotope cystography (which avoids a urinary catheter) is often preferred, particularly in older children (b p. 546). Pathology Kidney biopsies are rarely undertaken, as kidneys are often small at presentation. Characteristic appearances are chronic tubulointerstitial scars, with dilated, atrophied tubules and often an infl ammatory cell infi ltrate. Secondary hyperfi ltration injury develops over time, with compensatory hypertrophy of unaffected segments, vessel changes, and glomerular collapse and sclerosis. Management (in adults) Given that refl ux has ceased and that there is no new scar formation in adulthood, treatment is aimed at preventing chronic kidney disease progression.

Treat any new Urine infections vigorously. 714 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology Congenital abnormalities of the Kidney and urinary tract Introduction A group of well-recognized developmental anomalies that are now collectively referred to as congenital abnormalities of the Kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) (see Table 9. 2). Variations of these disorders are identifi - able in 1 in 500 antenatal USS, and they are responsible for 7 30% of all fetal abnormalities. Prior to routine antenatal scanning, these conditions were diagnosed when symptoms developed in childhood and, occasionally, adult life. They account for the majority of chronic kidney disease (and end-stage renal disease) in infants. Various gene mutations have been described, including SALL1, SIX1, HNF-1 B, and PAX2. The conditions appear polygenic, with variable penetrance. Clinical evaluation Thorough post-natal assessment, as for any congenital abnormality. This should include maternal drug use (prescribed or recreational), family history, and a comprehensive physical examination (targeted at important dysmorphic features, such as ear malformations, hearing loss, optic nerve colobomas, digital anomalies, and abnormal external genitalia). Investigation Suspected urinary tract abnormalities typically require a post-natal USS and micturating cystography. mercaptoacetyltriglycine scan renography or DMSA scanning will determine split function. Cystoscopy may be necessary. It is important to appreciate that several abnormalities may be present together (e. g. VUR in an ectopic Kidney). Genetic testing may be possible for several CAKUT-associated syndromes, e. g. CHARGE ( Co lobomas, H eart defects, A tresia choanae, R etardation of growth and development, G enital abnormalities and hypogonadism, E ar abnormalities 9 deafness). Table 9. 2 Important CAKUT disorders Abnormality Features Renal agenesis The ureteric bud fails to communicate with the metanephric blastema in 1st trimester. Often associated with other malformations, including VUR, and with genetic syndromes (e. g. Potter s syndrome l bilateral renal agenesis). Outcomes depend on these associations.

The incidence is increasing in developed countries. After a single stone, the likelihood of a second within 7 years is 7 50% (75% after a second). However, preventative measures are highly effective in most cases.

    "text": "Diffuse parenchymal calcifi cation with the Kidney is termed nephrocalcinosis (b p. 45). In the absence of nephrolithiasis, most patients with nephrocalcinosis are asymptomatic (and renal function correlates poorly with the degree of calcifi cation visible on imaging). Stone formation Stone formation around a crystal nidus is encouraged when the solubility of a urinary salt is exceeded in certain situations (termed supersaturation ). These include High solute delivery, concentrated Urine (Low volume), areas of stasis (anatomically abnormal urinary tract), and an excess of stone promoters over inhibitors. Supersaturation is dependent on free ion state, rather than absolute concentration, so will be signifi cantly infl uenced by the other constituents and characteristics of Urine, such as pH. Aggregation of crystals into stones involves a process of epithelial cell anchoring within the renal tubules. Stone composition An important part of management is to identify stone constituents and any metabolic predisposition to formation. Stone composition varies, according to geography. In the Mediterranean, 70% are uric acid, whilst, in the UK and USA, the majority are calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate. Both environmental and genetic factors infl uence this distribution. Stone composition and incidence (UK) Calcium oxalate/phosphate: 6080% (often mixed stonespure calcium phosphate stones are uncommon). Struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) 10 20% Uric acid 5 10% Stone types Calcium-based stones Most are c alcium oxalate, either alone or in combination with c alcium phosphate or urate. An associated metabolic abnormality (or other predisposing factor) can be identifi ed in many patients with recurrent stones, although some are truly idiopathic. NEPHROLITHIASIS 717 Risk factors (see Table 9. 3): Excessive excretion of calcium (hypercalciuria), oxalate (hyperoxaluria), or uric acid (hyperuricosuria). Uric acid crystals often form the nidus that progresses to a calcium-based stone. Factors that cause insolubility, e. g. insuffi cient citrate excretion (hypocitraturia). Citrate forms a s oluble complex with calcium. Low-volume, or concentrated, Urine. Abnormal urinary tract, e. g. medullary sponge Kidney. Renal tubular acidosis ( b p. 824).

Two distinct Liver enzyme defects are described (types I and II). Type II (enzyme: glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase) tends to be a milder disorder than type I (enzyme: alanine-glyoxalate aminotransferase). Uric acid stones Hyperuricosuria is most commonly associated with the formation of calcium oxalate stones! Pure uric acid stones are less common and are radiolucent on kidney, ureter, bladder X-rays. Three key factors infl uence their formation: Low Urine volume, elevated serum uric acid concentration, and Low Urine pH ( 5. 5).

    "text": "An increase in uric acid stone formation has been seen in parallel with obesity and insulin resistance (perhaps s to d Urine pH). Struvite stones (triple phosphate or infection stones) Struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) stones are typically large stones associated with urease-producing (6 urea-splitting) bacteria and an alkaline Urine. Urea breakdown produces excess ammonium and hydroxyl ions, a rise in urinary pH, and a decrease in phosphate solubility thus encouraging the precipitation of insoluble magnesium ammonium phosphatephate. These stones can act as a reservoir for further infection and can rapidly expand to fi ll much of the collecting system (termed staghorn calculi because of their characteristic appearance on imaging). Many common bacteria are urease producers, particularly P roteus (others: H aemophilus, P seudomonas, potassium lebsiella, Y ersinia, S taphylococcus epidermidis, C itrobacter, S erratia, and U reaplasma urealyicum ). Note: E. coli does not produce urease. Risk factors: ( s to i incidence of UTI), long-term catheterization, urinary stasis (e. g. neurogenic bladder). Antibiotic therapy (often long-term) and urological intervention, such as nephrolithotomy or open surgery, are usually required (although surgery may not always be possible, as patients are often complex with multiple comorbidities). Eradication of infection can be extremely diffi cult. Any available stone material should be cultured for antibiotic sensitivities. Distal renal tubular acidosis (b p. 824) Characterized by impaired distal tubular excretion of H, a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, and an alkaline Urine. Acidosis causes: Skeletal release of calcium and phosphate (l i urinary excretion of both). i citrate reabsorption in the proximal tubule. High urinary pH hypocitraturia i urinary excretion of calcium 2 and PO l a perfect storm for calcium phosphate precipitation. 4 Nephrocalcinosis is not uncommon, in addition to nephrolithiasis. Stone prevention: Sodium bicarbonate and Potassium citrate (correct metabolic acidosis and increase urinary citrate excretion). Avoid Urine pH 6. 5, as this encourages calcium phosphate precipitation. Large doses are often required. Bladder stones Usually arise in abnormal bladders. Predisposing factors include post-surgical reconstruction, UTI, bladder diverticulae, neurogenic bladder 9 bladder outfl ow obstruction. NEPHROLITHIASIS 719 Cystine Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive disorder, causing a tubular defect in the uptake of dibasic amino acid (cystine, ornithine, arginine, and lysine). There are two sources of cystine: (i) dietary and (ii) synthesized from methionine. Most cystine is reabsorbed in the renal tubules, with only 7 20mg per day excreted in the Urine under normal circumstances. In cystinuria, failure of uptake leads to excretion of 250mg/day. Cystine is poorly soluble, so this larger amount inevitably leads to insoluble crystal formation and stone development. Autosomal inheritance was fi rst described in the 1950s. Initially, three types were proposed (types I III). However, this terminology is now less popular, as types II and III have proved diffi cult to differentiate. The type II/III form has a more complex mode of inheritance (described as incompletely recessive ). Clinically, even carriers of type II/III cystinuria may be stone formers. The genes (so far) associated with type I and types II/III are SLC3A1 and SLC7A9, respectively, with multiple mutations identifi ed. Although available, genetic testing is not in routine clinical use. Note: avoid cysteine/cystine confusion. Methionine is an essential amino acid. It can be converted to cyste ine in the body. Two cyst e ine molecules then combine together (via a strong disulphide bond) to form one cystine molecule (hence cystine dimeric or dibasic ). When cystine stones are broken with a laser, they give off a characteristic sulphuric rotten egg odour (the disulphide bond is broken, and sulphur is released). Cystinuria should be suspected in all childhood stone formers.",

    "text": "Cystinuria should be suspected in all childhood stone formers. The disorder usually presents during a patient s teens or 20s, often with multiple and bilateral stones. Management: Maintain High Urine volumes ( b p. 722). Lower urinary pH (with Potassium citrate) ( b p. 723). Restrict Sodium intake (reduces calciuria) ( b p. 722). The precursor of cystine (methionine) is an essential amino acid, so complete dietary exclusion is not possible, but restriction, combined with reduced animal Protein intake, is desirable (an excellent recipe book is available free at M h ttp: //www. cystinuriauk. co. uk ). Drug therapy is required in only a minority of patients. Mechanism: combine with cystine (at the disulphide bond) and increase solubility. Tiopronin (alpha mercaptopropionylglycine) is the most commonly used, as it has fewer side effects than older alternatives. A typical regimen is 1, 000mg/day in three divided doses (depending on urinary cystine levels and tolerability). Unlicensed in the UK but often used under specialist supervision. Penicillamine; generally less well tolerated. Typical regimen: 1 3g/ day in divided doses. X Captopril: if others unsuitable. Effi cacy uncertain. 720 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology Stone disease: evaluation Clinical presentation The clinical presentation of stone disease will vary, according to stone type, location, and size ranging from small, asymptomatic, stones through to large infected and obstructing staghorn calculi. Pain (b p. 724), haematuria (macroscopic and microscopic), infection (may be relapsing), and obstruction ( (cid: 2) l acute kidney injury if single functioning Kidney) are the key clinical considerations. Progressive chronic kidney disease is also possible from recurrent obstruction, infection, and renal interstitial damage ( s to the fi brosis incited by microcrystals). Who to evaluate? In patients presenting with a fi rst urinary stone, detailed metabolic investigation is not usually justifi ed or cost-effective. However, that is not to say that no evaluation should be undertaken. A basic assessment (history, physical examination, limited dietary assessment, limited Blood testing, urinalysis, Urine culture, and appropriate imaging) should be undertaken in all cases, with a more thorough metabolic evaluation (e. g. detailed 24h Urine testing and comprehensive dietetic review) reserved for all recurrent stone formers and those known to have non-calcium-based stones. Where stone material is available, it should always be sent for analysis. History: Age at fi rst onset (younger age makes a metabolic abnormality, such as cystinuria or primary hyperoxaluria, more likely). Number and frequency of stones to date (and previous interventions, such as lithotripsy, undertaken). Site (recurrence at same site suggests a urinary tract abnormality). Family history. Stone type (if known). Non-calcium stones mandate closer scrutiny. Associated urinary tract infection. Relevant systemic disease (e. g. Crohn s disease, hypercalcaemic disorder, obesity, and insulin resistance (uric acid stones)). Drug history: Calcium stones: loop diuretics, calcium supplements, antacids, vitamin D preparations, corticosteroids, theophylline, acetazolamide. Uric acid stones: salicylates, probenecid. Crystalluria: indinavir, nelfi navir (both antiretrovirals), and triamterene can cause crystalluria as a precursor to stone formation. Diet ( b p. 723). Lifestyle: those who restrict their fl uid intake to avoid inconvenient bathroom breaks, e. g. taxi drivers, surgeons. Exercise intensity. Obvious systemic predisposition, e. g. gouty tophi, spinal injury with bladder dysfunction. Urinalysis: Microscopic haematuria. Proteinuria. Leucocytes and nitrites. Urinary pH: Usually High if struvite or calcium phosphate stones. Usually Low if uric acid or calcium oxalate stones.

Imaging in nephrolithiasis 2 Calcium-containing or struvite stones are radio-opaque, while uric acid and cystine stones are radiolucent, i. e. not visible on a plain X-ray. However, they will be visible as an acoustic shadow on USS and as a fi lling defect on contrast computed tomography or IVU. computed tomography-kidney, ureter, bladder offers the single best test. It can be rapidly performed, is more sensitive and specifi c than an IVU, and avoids the administration of contrast (although radiation dose is higher). A subsequent computed tomography contrast study may help to identify an underlying urinary tract abnormality. Plain kidney, ureter, bladder allows monitoring of radio-opaque stones. IVU offers an alternative if computed tomography unavailable. USS may be helpful if obstruction suspected and is also sensitive for stones in the renal pelvis but often misses ureteric stones. For considerations when stones occur in pregnancy, see b p. 860. 722 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology Stone disease: management Prevention of recurrent nephrolithiasis General measures: Consider a specialist referral. Attendance at a stone clinic has been shown to reduce stone recurrence, independent of other factors! Increase fl uid intake for daily UO 2. 5L/day. Urine should appear clear, not dark and concentrated. Advise to: Drink a large glass of Water at specifi c times during the day, e. g. upon waking, arriving at work, etc. Drink a glass of fruit juice with breakfast. Keep a large bottle of Water at their workplace and sip from it regularly throughout the day. Drink a glass of Water each hour, on the hour. Add slices of lemon, lime, or orange to Water. It improves fl avour and helps to alkalinize the Urine. Drink two full glasses of Water at each meal (one before, one after). Carry a refi llable Water bottle everywhere walking, shopping, driving, watching television, etc. Eat fruits and vegetables (contain a High amount of Water). Include more liquid and wet foods in the diet, e. g. soups, stew, jellies, etc. Drink before bedtime. Aim to provoke nocturia at least once per night. Reduce animal Protein intake: Protein ingestion l i acid formation l reduced urinary citrate excretion l less citrate available to form a s oluble complex with calcium.

Aim 0. 8 1. 0g/kg/day animal Protein (meat, poultry, fi social history, eggs, cheese, yogurt), and advise regarding non-animal Protein substitutes (lentils, chickpeas, Kidney beans, butter beans, baked beans, quorn). Reduce sodium intake 3g/day (6g/day NaCl). sodium enhances calciuria (partly explaining the increased incidence of hypercalciuria in hypertensive patients). Educate patients to understand salt content labelling on foods. Recommend a normal calcium intake of 7 700 1, 000mg/day. (cid: 2) Many patients are erroneously told to reduce calcium ingestion. This risks osteoporosis (esp. ) and may actually promote stone formation (Low Ca2 intake li oxalate absorption and excretion). Calcium supplement supplements should be avoided, however. Reduce dietary oxalate (see Table 9. 4). If uric acid stones, reduce dietary purine intake (see Table 9. 4). Increase intake of citrus fruits (a source of Potassium citrate). Avoid excessive vitamin C supplementation (increases Urine oxalate). Monitor urinary stone screen for effi cacy of therapy. STONE DISEASE: MANAGEMENT 723 Table 9. 4 Dietary sources of oxalate and purine High oxalate High purine (uric acid) Greens (e. g. spinach and kale), Meat (particularly viscera, e. g.

Potassium citrate increases urinary citrate and urinary pH. Aim for a pH of 6. 5. Higher might encourage calcium phosphate stones. Liquid preparations can be unpalatable, but tablet formulations (e. g. Urocit-potassium wax tablet) are available (although more expensive). The Potassium salt is favoured over the Sodium salt, as the latter promotes calciuria. If u-Ca2 raised: Potassium citrate as for normal either indapamide 2. 5 5mg PO daily or hydrochlorothiazide 25 50mg PO daily (monitor potassium with both). Thiazide diuretics increase tubular Ca2 reabsorption (note: avoid triamterene, as it causes crystalluria itself). If d potassium develops, add amiloride (for Potassium). Recheck urinary citrate and calcium excretion after several weeks, and adjust appropriately. Hyperoxaluria In malabsorption disorders, ensure adequate hydration. Hypocitraturia and hypokalaemia can occur and should be corrected. Colestyramine binds fatty acids and prevents their delivery to the colon (where they would otherwise increase oxalate absorption). Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) can be helpful, although large doses may be required. Calcium carbonate 500 1, 500mg tds before meals may reduce oxalate absorption. Primary hyperoxaluria can only be cured by Liver transplantation. Struvite stones Require vigorous eradication of infection; antibiotic therapy is often prolonged, e. g. 3 6 months, directed by cultures and sensitivities. Cystine stones (see b p. 719). Hyperuricosuria Complete dissolution of uric acid stones can often be achieved, using a combination of High fl uid intake, urinary alkalinization (pH 6. 5), reduced dietary purine intake, and, if necessary, allopurinol 100 300mg PO daily. 724 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology Acute renal colic Presentation The syndrome caused by stone(s) passage down the urinary tract.

ESWL access to stones in the middle and distal ureter may be restricted by the pelvic bones, and ureteroscopy provides a very effective alternative. Percutaneous (and rarely open) nephrolithotomy have excellent results for calculi 20mm or complicated stones. ACUTE RENAL COLIC 725 2 If associated infection, co-amoxiclav IVI, then PO, or third-generation cephalosporin IVI, then PO, or fl uoroquinolone (e. g. ciprofl oxacin 250 500mg bd PO). Consider additional single-dose gentamicin 3 5mg/ kg IVI. Discuss with microbiology. 3 An obstructed, infected system caused by stones (pyonephrosis) is an emergency. Septicaemia 9 shock can supervene rapidly. Commence IVI antibiotics and fl uid resuscitation immediately. Discuss with urology, and arrange an urgent referral for percutaneous nephrostomy and drainage ( b p. 734). Surgical management of stone disease: a primer Surgical management of renal stone disease has changed signifi cantly with the growth of minimally invasive techniques. In general, open surgical techniques have been relegated to second, even third, line. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL): Acoustic shock wave energy is delivered under fl uoroscopic or USS guidance. 1, 500 2, 500 shock waves are delivered during each session (typically 7 30min). It is an ambulatory procedure but requires analgesia and (often) IV sedation. It can be repeated at 10 14 day intervals. Fragmentation is followed by clearance of fragments. Multiple large fragments can block the ureter termed Steinestrasse or Stone Street . For stones 20mm, a ureteric stent is placed fi rst. Achieves very Good rates of stone clearance for stones ≤20mm. ESWL is now fi rst-line in most cases, except larger (10mm), more distal ureteric stones where ureteroscopy is preferred.",

Contraindications: AAA, pregnancy, bleeding tendency, UTI. Side effects: haemorrhage, haematoma, adjacent organ damage. Ureteroscopy: Increasingly small, fl exible ureteroscopes are allowing access to the entire urinary tract. Stones are shattered, using a holmium laser, and the fragments can be retrieved. More rigid scopes and basket techniques are no longer favoured. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL): Suitable for larger or proximal ureteric stones. A sheath is passed into the pelvicalyceal system percutaneously (usually the dorsal calyx of the lower pole, although higher punctures allow antegrade ureteroscopy). Laser or USS is used to fragment the stone or it is removed under direct vision. Also allows chemolysis the infusion of an alkaline solution to dissolve stones (usually uric acid). Less commonly used. Open surgery is now rarely necessary. Laparoscopic techniques are increasingly popular. 726 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology Obstruction: overview 2 Urinary tract obstruction is a common, and potentially reversible, cause of both acute Kidney injury and chronic Kidney disease. Obstruction leads to delayed urinary transit, an increase in intratract pressures, and renal dysfunction. It will eventually cause dilatation of the renal pelvis and calyces. This is referred to as hydronephrosis. Obstruction causes renal failure when bilateral or when it involves a single functioning Kidney. Obstruction accounts for 7 5% of end-stage renal disease in those aged 65. Defi nitions Obstructive uropathy: the structural or functional changes in the urinary tract that impede the normal fl ow of Urine. Classifi ed according to site, degree, and duration. May be complete or partial. Obstructive nephropathy: the Kidney disease resulting from impaired urinary fl ow and consequent renal parenchymal damage. Hydronephrosis: upper tract dilatation. Obstruction is not the only cause but is the commonest and must always be excluded. 2 May not always be present in obstruction, particularly in early stage. Epidemiology Aetiology and frequency varies with age and sex (see Table 9. 5). Table 9. 5 Epidemiology of obstruction Age Sex Aetiology 10 Congenital abnormalities; urethral valves, PUJ obstruction 20 Pregnancy and gynaecological malignancy Renal calculi 60 Prostatic disease Classifi cation Cause (see Table 9. 6): Congenital, e. g. urethral valves. Acquired, e. g. prostatic disease. Level: Upper tract: ureter or above. Lower tract: bladder or below. Unilateral or bilateral: Both kidneys are usually involved in lower tract obstruction. An individual Kidney can be affected by upper tract obstruction. Complete or partial: Complete: 2 commonest cause of anuria. Partial: can be diffi cult to diagnose, as Urine output may vary.

Blood clots may be caused by bleeding renal tumours, surgery, AV malformations, renal trauma (including renal biopsy), adult polycystic Kidney disease, and traumatic catheterization. 728 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology Obstruction: pathophysiology Normal physiology Urine production is continuous, and it reaches the bladder as a result of several processes: Glomerular fi ltration Hypertension. Renal tract peristalsis. Pacemaker cells in the renal calyces initiate contraction of the renal pelvis. Subsequent coordinated ureteric smooth muscle contraction directs Urine toward the bladder. Pressures reach 20 80cmH O (resting Hypertension is 0 5cmH O). 2 2 Gravity. The vesicoureteric junction (VUJ) prevents retrograde ureteric Urine fl ow during bladder contraction. Pathophysiology There is a relationship between ureteric Hypertension and renal Blood fl ow. Following an initial increase in both (minutes), further increases in ureteric Hypertension result in a reduction in renal Blood fl ow (hours). This mismatch progressively widens, with consequent ischaemic injury. Impaired glomerular and tubular function result. Glomerular Proximal tubular Hypertension rises early. This causes a net d in hydraulic Hypertension gradient across glomerular capillaries and a signifi cant reduction in glomerular filtration rate. Afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction (mediated by i angiotensin II and i thromboxane A d NO and d vasodilator prostaglandins) reduces 2 both renal plasma fl ow and glomerular capillary Hypertension. Blood is redirecting away from non-fi ltering nephrons. Ischaemic nephrons release mediators of infl ammation, leading to macrophage infi ltration, interstitial fi brosis, and irreversible injury. Tubular Tubular dysfunction often manifests after the resolution of obstruction. Includes reduced urinary concentrating ability ( d expression of both sodium transporters aquaporins), abnormal electrolyte handling (mild sodium wasting and i potassium excretion), and acidosis ( s to abnormal intercalated cell H ATPase activity). In lower tract obstruction, the normally protective VUJ is rendered incompetent, allowing retrograde transmission of Hypertension. Hypertrophy of the ureteric musculature attempts to compensate for the increased resistance. The ureter becomes stretched and tortuous, resulting in ureteric distension and hydronephrosis. Fibrous bands develop along the length of the ureter, adding a further element of obstruction that may persist after the resolution of the original cause. Histopathology Initial changes are of renal enlargement with oedema and pelvicalyceal dilatation. OBSTRUCTION: PATHOPHYSIOLOGY 729 This advances to encompass distal tubular dilatation, proximal tubular cell atrophy, and, eventually, enlargement of Bowman s space, with periglomerular fi brosis. Continuing damage is essentially a form of ischaemic injury, with macrophage-derived TGF-B fuelling progressive, irreversible tubulointerstitial fi brosis.",

    "text": "Continuing damage is essentially a form of ischaemic injury, with macrophage-derived TGF-B fuelling progressive, irreversible tubulointerstitial fi brosis. Unresolved obstruction eventually causes macroscopic change, characterized by dilatation of the renal pelvis, fl attening of the papillae, and gradual thinning of the cortex and medulla. Recovery of renal function The prognosis post-relief of obstruction is contingent on antecedent duration and severity. Available clinical and experimental evidence suggests that full recovery of renal function is possible after complete obstruction ≤ 7 days duration. There may be some functional recovery after 4 weeks, but signifi cant permanent renal damage is usually present beyond 6 weeks. Dialysis support is likely to be needed during this time. 3 This underlines the need for prompt diagnosis and treatment of acute obstruction if permanent renal damage is to be avoided. The serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate may underestimate the extent of parenchymal damage, with the hyperfi ltration and hypertrophy of remaining nephrons masking nephron scarring and dropout. This is particularly relevant to unilateral obstruction where the contralateral Kidney compensates to maintain function. In more chronic, or partial, forms of obstruction, renal parenchymal changes are likely to be well established, so return of renal function is unpredictable, at best. The renal cortical thickness on ultrasound (or other imaging) may give some indication of the potential to salvage glomerular filtration rate, but a degree of chronic kidney disease is often inevitable. However, subsequent progression of chronic kidney disease is often relatively slow, providing blood pressure is well controlled. Evidence of tubular dysfunction often persists after the relief of chronic obstruction and can be clinically relevant, e. g. polyuria, mild salt wasting, and acidosis. 730 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology How to approach obstruction 3 It is vital that obstruction is considered and actively excluded in all presentations of acute kidney injury and many of chronic kidney disease. An accurate history may provide clues as to whether the obstruction is acute/chronic, unilateral/bilateral, congenital/acquired. Clinical presentation Symptoms Depend on the cause and level of obstruction. (cid: 2) Unilateral obstruction and chronic partial obstruction can be clinically completely silent. Loin Pain: Flank Pain suggests upper tract obstruction. Acute ureteric colic can be severe. It is usually unilateral and may radiate to the ipsilateral groin ( b p. 724). 2 Flank Pain, fever, and signs of pyelonephritis suggest obstruction with infection ( l requires emergency decompression of the affected system). Pain radiating to the fl ank during micturition is suggestive of vesicoureteric refl ux ( b p. 712). Pain after High-volume fl uid intake (e. g. beer! ) occurs in pelvi-ureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction ( b p. 736). Retroperitoneal fi brosis may cause backache ( b p. 738). Haematuria: Macroscopic haematuria occurs with calculi and uroepithelial tumours. Changes in Urine volume: 2 Complete anuria should always suggest obstruction. Polyuria can be a feature of partial obstruction. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggest bladder dysfunction or outfl ow obstruction. Obstructive (voiding) symptoms: reduced urinary stream, hesitancy, interrupted fl ow, incomplete emptying, acute retention. Storage (fi lling) symptoms: nocturia, daytime frequency, urgency, incontinence, dysuria. Any patient presenting with chronic kidney disease 3 or above with signifi cant LUTS warrants a urinary tract ultrasound (including pre-/post-voiding). UTI: Obstruction l urinary stasis l infection. Obstructed Urine is diffi cult to sterilize with antimicrobials. A single UTI in a child or an adult is suspicious and should be further investigated. Recurrent infections in a should prompt the same. Signs Palpable bladder ((cid: 2) you will miss it if you do not look for it! ). Loin tenderness.

HOW TO APPROACH OBSTRUCTION 731 Blood Hypertension: i blood pressure ( l mediated via renin or salt and Water retention in chronic kidney disease). d blood pressure ( l polyuria with salt and Water wasting). Rectal and pelvic examinations may (often) be necessary. Investigations Urinalysis: Haematuria, leucocytes, nitrites. Proteinuria, when present, is usually Low-grade. Bland Urine, free of Blood or Protein, can point toward obstruction during the investigation of renal impairment, as it makes an intrinsic renal lesion less likely. MSU for M, CS. Electrolytes: Mild acidosis, with associated hyperkalaemia. Creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate: Remember these can be falsely reassuring in unilateral obstruction. CRP, WCC, Blood cultures for infection. Consider a PSA in with marked LUTS ( b p. 772). Imaging ( b p. 732). 732 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology Obstruction: imaging Imaging is fundamental to the accurate diagnosis of the site and cause of obstruction. Ultrasound is usually fi rst-line, but other modalities may be necessary to further progress management. 2 No single investigation can be considered to have completely excluded obstruction when clinical suspicion remains High. Ultrasound (USS) See Fig. 9. 1. Portable, rapid, and non-invasive. Can measure pelvicalyceal diameter. May demonstrate dilated upper ureters. No contrast or radiation, so the imaging of choice in patients who have renal impairment or are pregnant. However, USS is operator-dependent, and obstruction (particularly early) can occur without a dilated system (35% of patients with proven obstruction). Moreover, a dilated system demonstrates hydronephrosis, which is not the same as proving obstruction (see Box 9. 2). Box 9. 2 Ultrasound and obstruction: the pitfalls Obstruction without a dilated system (false negative) Hydronephrosis may not be apparent in early (fi rst 2 3 days) obstruction. Dilatation may not occur if retroperitoneal tumour or fi brous tissue encases the Kidney. ATN may coexist. ATN l oligo-anuria l no hydronephrosis develops. Partial obstruction may not cause a demonstrable hydronephrosis (although glomerular filtration rate is still reduced). Dilated system without obstruction (false positive) Anatomical variants: extrarenal pelvis, megaureter (often secondary to vesicoureteral refl ux) ( b p. 712). Pregnancy: progesterone effects on smooth muscle can cause dilated ureters and pelvis. Post obstruction: an abnormal baggy system may persist after the resolution of chronic obstruction. Comparison with previous imaging will be helpful in this situation. Further imaging (computed tomography or isotope renography) may be necessary. computed tomography Highly sensitive for calculi. A non-contrast computed tomography-kidney, ureter, bladder is now the investigation of choice for acute fl ank Pain ( b p. 724). Superior anatomical defi nition to USS. More likely to demonstrate site and nature of obstruction. If clinical fi ndings and USS equivocal, computed tomography kidney, ureter, bladder is most likely to provide the most information on the site and cause of the obstruction. OBSTRUCTION: IMAGING 733 Particularly helpful for the diagnosis of extrinsic compression and retroperitoneal fi brosis, as well as the staging of tumours. IV contrast improves diagnostic utility, (cid: 2) but take care to reduce the risk of contrast nephropathy in the presence of renal impairment ( b p. 148).

Normally, the diuretic, administered 30min after the isotope, would cause prompt washout from the Kidney. Persistence suggests obstruction. Excretion of both kidneys can be compared.

(cid: 2) Sensitivity decreases if renal function is signifi cantly impaired. 734 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology Obstruction: treatment Overview 2 Effective interdisciplinary communication between nephrology, urology, and radiology is essential. Management is directed by: (i) the site, duration, and cause of obstruction; (ii) the presence of infection; and (iii) the degree of metabolic disturbance. Treatment goals Treat any emergent metabolic or fl uid and electrolyte disturbances, e. g. i potassium, pulmonary oedema. This may require Dialysis or CRRT; 2 Seek expert help. 2 If there is evidence of sepsis (fever, abnormal urinalysis or Urine microscopy, i WCC, i CRP, shock), then take appropriate cultures, and treat urgently. Prompt relief of obstruction to prevent further metabolic disturbance and protect the Kidney(s) from irreversible renal damage. If the duration of obstruction is unclear, assume it is acute. If a single Kidney is obstructed, do not be reassured by preserved glomerular filtration rate the obstructed Kidney may still need urgent intervention. Manage the underlying pathology, e. g. recurrent stones, tumour. Relief of obstructiongeneral principles Bladder outfl ow obstruction can often be relieved with a urinary catheter. If this cannot be passed per urethra, a suprapubic catheter may be necessary. In an emergency situation or if infection above the obstruction is suspected, upper tract obstruction should be relieved through the placement of a percutaneous nephrostomy under LA. Subsequent antegrade stenting of the obstruction through the nephrostomy may be possible. In non-emergency situations and when the patient is fi t for GA, cystoscopic placement of retrograde ureteric stents is an appropriate approach. Urinary catheters and ureteric stents require follow-up and elective replacement. (cid: 2) Be vigilant for infection or blockage. Percutaneous nephrostomy Is it necessary? Pros: Decompresses an obstructed system and rapidly improves renal function. Decompression of one Kidney should be suffi cient initially (preferentially decompress the Kidney with the most parenchyma visible on imaging fi rst). Will decompress an infected system with minimal instrumentation. No GA required. Allows time for a more defi nitive management plan to be developed. OBSTRUCTION: TREATMENT 735 Cons: Invasive.

Post-procedure care Regular post-nephrostomy observations and clinical review are mandatory, particularly in the presence of sepsis. Careful fl uid balance: there is likely to be a brisk post-obstructive diuresis. See Post-obstructive diuresis below. Make sure the nephrostomy is well secured! As well as being therapeutic, a nephrostomy also has diagnostic potential. A nephrostogram involves injection of contrast via the nephrostomy to examine antegrade ureteric fl ow and identify the level and source of obstruction. Post-obstructive diuresis A large-volume diuresis (0. 5 1L/h) post-relief of obstruction. Most common after the treatment of bilateral obstruction or obstruction of a single functioning Kidney. Results from either: Appropriate excretion of retained salt and Water in renal failure, or Inappropriate losses due to tubular dysfunction. Consequences: salt loss, volume depletion, electrolyte disturbances, ATN with delayed recovery of renal function. Management: Regular assessment of fl uid balance, including blood pressure, hourly UO, clinical assessment, daily weights. Regular UE (12-hourly if diuresis large). Also monitor potassium, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphate, and magnesium daily. Fluid replacement: Once euvolaemic, administer IVI 0. 9% NaCl as UO 50mL/h. Replace electrolytes, as necessary.

Extrinsic (rare): external compression (e. g. aberrant renal vessel). Acquired: Intrinsic: stricture (infection, trauma), uroepithelial malignancy. Extrinsic: malignancy, retroperitoneal fi brosis. Symptoms and signs Increasingly diagnosed with maternal USS screening. It is the most common cause of antenatal hydronephrosis ( 7 1 in 1, 500 live births). L R but may be bilateral. Children may present with failure to thrive, fl ank Pain, urinary tract infections, a palpable mass, haematuria, hypertension, or renal impairment (if bilateral). 20% diagnosed as adults (with a large number presumably never diagnosed at all). Classically causes fl ank Pain after alcohol, coffee, or diuretics (Diettel s crisis). Investigation USS (preferred) or computed tomography will show dilatation of the renal pelvis with a normal distal ureter. Diuretic isotope renography demonstrates obstruction with delayed washout . Serial scans are performed to determine optimal management. Micturating cystoureterogram (MCUG) may demonstrate concomitant VUJ obstruction or posterior urethral valves. Management No randomized trials: Generally conservative unless: impaired renal function (often manifesting as a change in split renal function), recurrent UTIs, calculi, persistent Pain, increasing hydronephrosis. Prophylactic antibiotics of little benefi t. Surgery: Pyeloplasty involves resecting the abnormal ureteric segment and reattaching normal ureter to the renal pelvis. Various techniques are available, including open, laparoscopic, and endoscopic. All are very successful. If the obstruction is due to aberrant vasculature, the PUJ is repositioned above the vessel. PELVI-URETERIC (PUJ) OBSTRUCTION 737 Vesicoureteric junction obstruction VUJ (like PUJ) obstruction can be congenital or acquired. It may present with a similar constellation of symptoms to PUJ obstruction but often later in childhood or as an adult. It is very important to look for associated VUR (b p. 712) and PUJ obstruction. If surgery is necessary, it involves re-implantation of the ureter.",

    "text": "If surgery is necessary, it involves re-implantation of the ureter. Posterior urethral valves (PUV) A developmental abnormality in males, leaving obstructing membranous folds in the lumen of the posterior urethra. The most common cause of urinary obstruction in infants (7 1 in 8, 000). The most common cause of chronic kidney disease due to obstruction in children ( 7 15% progress to end-stage renal disease). PUV cause dilatation of the proximal urethra, with hypertrophy of the bladder wall, bilateral megaureters, and hydronephrosis. Most are identifi ed by antenatal USS (bilateral hydronephrosis, dilated bladder, and dilated posterior urethra: keyhole sign ). Associated with other abnormalities, including urinary tract (VUR, renal dysplasia) and non-urinary tract (e. g. lung hypoplasia). Children present with failure to thrive, abdominal distension, UTIs, incontinence (daytime and nocturnal enuresis), and other urinary symptoms, including frequency, straining, poor stream, and large voids. MCUG is used to confi rm diagnosis. Management includes urinary drainage in the newborn, usually by catheterization. Cystoscopic resection of the PUV should be undertaken as early as possible. Fetal intervention is now being undertaken in some specialist centres for severe cases. If PUV ablation is not possible, then a vesicostomy or other form of urinary drainage procedure should be considered. Bladder dysfunction is common and often persistent, requiring ongoing management, such as clean intermittent catheterization. 738 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology Retroperitoneal fi brosis: overview Overview Retroperitoneal fi brosis (RPF) describes a group of disorders characterized by the development of fi broinfl ammatory tissue that surrounds and encases the abdominal aorta and other retroperitoneal structures, including the ureters. Encasement impairs ureteric contractility and causes an obstructive uropathy and then nephropathy. There are idiopathic (70%) and secondary forms. Both are uncommon ( 7 1 per 200, 000 500, 000 population). The idiopathic form usually occurs age 40 60, with a 3: 1 : ratio. Aetiology p and s RPF are usually very similar pathologically. A tough, plaque-like material encases the major vessels and ureters. Microscopically, there is a macrophageand plasma cell-rich infl ammatory infi ltrate, with progressive fi brotic change. This fi brous tissue consists of fi broblasts (including activated myofi broblasts) and type I collagen. The causes of this process remain poorly understood. Suggestions: They are an infl ammatory reaction to aortic atherosclerosis. Evidence: leakage of proinfl ammatory lipid-derived material, such as ceroid (an oxidized LDL) across the wall of atheromatous aortas. It is an autoimmune phenomenon. Evidence: coexisting autoimmune conditions, autoantibodies (60% ANA ve in one series), HLA associations (HLA-B27 or HLA-DRB1 03). Causes Idiopathic. Infl ammatory periaortitis (severe atherosclerosis), e. g. aortic aneurysm. Drug-induced: classically methysergide, but also bromocriptine, methyldopa, and possibly beta-blockers. Chronic retroperitoneal infection (particularly TB). Other infl ammatory conditions (e. g. sarcoidosis). After retroperitoneal trauma. Erdheim Chester disease: a rare histiocyte disorder, characterized by osteosclerotic bone lesions. Extraskeletal effects may include retroperitoneal infi ltration. Malignant: Lymphoma, lymphoproliferative disorders, carcinoid. Metastatic or locally invasive malignancies (e. g. colon). Post-radiotherapy. Clinical features Symptoms may be insidious and present 6 months prior to diagnosis (which is often considered only when i serum creatinine becomes apparent). Usually non-specifi c, e. g. malaise, anorexia, fever, and weight loss. Flank and Low back Pain are relatively common. RETROPERITONEAL FIBROSIS: OVERVIEW 739 Vascular encasement may produce oedema or claudication. Associations: infl ammatory bowel disease, sclerosing cholangitis, ankylosing spondylitis, SLE, scleroderma, vasculitides, Raynaud s. An association is also emerging with the relatively new clinicopathological entity of IgG4-related sclerosing disease. This has been described in various tissues, particularly pancreatic ( autoimmune pancreatitis ), and is characterized by i circulating IgG4 as well as IgG4 plasma cell-rich infl ammatory infi ltrates.",

A computed tomography-guided TruCut needle biopsy can be performed but can miss active areas (PET may help to identify these).

Resolution of infl ammatory processes (and 6 both local and systemic symptoms). Prevention of progressive fi brosis. Exclusion of secondary causes, particularly malignancy. Patients are best managed with an integrated medical and surgical approach, although there are no controlled trials to guide therapy. Medical management May be appropriate without surgery if no renal impairment. Stop any possible contributory drugs. Corticosteroids d infl ammatory tissue encasing the ureter(s) and may restore ureteric contractility and patency. Response is unpredictable. Start prednisolone 0. 5 1mg/kg/day for 7 4 8 weeks. Slowly taper to 10mg, according to infl ammatory markers (ESR, CRP) and serial imaging. Reconsider diagnosis if unresponsive. Aim to discontinue after 12 24 months. Relapse in not uncommon, so long-term surveillance is mandatory. Combined corticosteroids and MMF show promise as initial therapy. Azathioprine and methotrexate have both been used successfully, both when steroid therapy has failed and as steroid-sparing agents. Tamoxifen ((cid: 2) SE: thromboembolism) is a potential alternative when steroids are contraindicated. Protocols vary, and mechanisms are unclear (may increase fi broblastic release of antifi brotic TGFB ). Potential therapies include anti-CD20 therapy and TNF-A inhibitors. Surgical management Preoperative medical therapy may have reduced infl ammation. Open exploration with ureterolysis is the fi rst step. The ureters (usually with JJ stents in situ ) are identifi ed, freed, and moved laterally. The ureters are then manipulated to prevent re-obstruction. Wrapping with a protective layer of omental fat is the commonest approach. Ureteric intraperitoneal transplantation is an alternative.

Simple renal cysts are commonly observed in normal kidneys. Their incidence increases with age. USS will not detect lesions 5mm. The differential diagnosis and investigation of renal cystic disease are discussed elsewhere ( b p. 598). See Table 9. 8 for classifi cation. Simple cysts USS criteria: Round. Smooth-walled. Anechoic. Good ultrasound transmission through the cyst. If all these features are present, a cyst is very likely to be benign. 2 If uncertainty persists, proceed to contrast-enhanced computed tomography. computed tomography criteria: Smooth and thin-walled. Similar density to Water. No contrast enhancement. The Bosniak classifi cation is the standard for radiological assessment of renal cysts (see Table 9. 8). Equivocal cases should be followed, with repeat scans every 6 12 months. The solid renal mass The concern is malignancy (carcinoma), but solid lesions can also be benign (e. g. angiomyolipoma). INVESTIGATION OF A RENAL MASS 743 computed tomography, and particularly magnetic resonance imaging, may detect small quantities of fat, highly suggestive of an angiomyolipoma. (cid: 2) However, imaging cannot exclude malignancy with absolute certainty. Lesions 1. 5cm cannot be accurately characterized by imaging. Active surveillance of these is generally advocated. 2 Features of concern: Contrast enhancement. Thickened or irregular wall. Necrotic areas (implying rapid growth). Diameter 3cm (more likely to metastasize). In these circumstances, removal is usually necessary. For smaller lesions in patients at High surgical risk, alternatives beyond surveillance are percutaneous radiofrequency ablation or cryotherapy.

More common in developed world. Incidence is increasing (partly because of small incidental tumours presenting earlier on imaging) and survival rates improving. Genetics There is evidence for a strong genetic predisposition, including: Risk of a second RCC is High in those with fi rst at a young age. Several hereditary syndromes are associated with RCC, including: von Hippel Lindau (VHL) (most common), hereditary papillary renal carcinoma, familial oncocytoma, and Birt Hogg Dube syndrome. Factors suggesting a genetic infl uence in those without a defi ned hereditary syndrome include: onset age 40, multifocal disease, and close relatives with RCC. Several genetic mutations in both sporadic and hereditary RCC have been identifi ed, particularly on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p). Inactivating mutations of the V HL gene (chromosome 3p25) are particularly common. VHL Protein functions as a tumour suppressor, targeting the products of hypoxia-inducible genes for proteasomal degradation. These include: VEGF (l angiogenesis). TGF-A ( l cell growth). d VHL Protein l Protein overexpression l epithelial proliferation angiogenesis l neoplastic transformation. Genetic heterogeneity is suggested by the involvement of other genes. Inactivating mutations of two genes (S ETD2 and JARID1C ) involved in the histone integrity have recently been described. Overexpression of p53 Protein is present in 7 50% tumours (and associated with a worse prognosis). RENAL CELL CARCINOMA: GENERAL 745 RCC: pathological and molecular subtypes Clear cell (7 75%) Originate from proximal tubule. Cells have clear cytoplasm. Deletion of chromosome 3p typical. Papillary ( 7 15%) Originate from proximal tubule but pathologically and genetically distinct. Frequently multifocal. Classifi ed into two subtypes, with different genetic and prognostic inferences. Chromophilic. Chromophobic ( 7 5%) Originate from intercalated cells. Lack the lipid content of clear cell tumours and appear darker macroscopically. Chromosome 3p intact. Oncocytic (5%) Originate from cells of the collecting duct. Oncocytes are recognized as well-differentiated cells with eosinophilic, mitochondria-rich cytoplasm. Generally behave in a benign manner. Collecting duct (1%) Younger age groups. Aggressive tumour, with some similarities to urothelial cancer. Often presents with haematuria. Medullary carcinoma (1%) Variant of collecting duct carcinoma. Associated with sickle cell trait. Translocation carcinomas (1%) Younger age groups, especially those receiving chemotherapy for other childhood cancers. Heterogeneous genetic abnormalities, often involving transcription factors. Incidence increasing. von HippelLindau (VHL) disease Autosomal dominant multisystem disorder, characterized by benign and malignant tumours in many organ systems. 7 1 in 35, 000 live births. 7 90% penetrance by age 65. VHL gene inactivation l overproduction of vascular growth factors. Manifestations: Renal involvement in 60%: cysts (70%), RCC (always clear cell, usually multiple) (50%), end-stage renal disease from the required surgical removal of renal tissue (25%). Retinal and CNS haemangioblastomas. Phaeochromocytoma. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours and pancreatic cysts. Epididymal cystadenoma.

Table 9. 9 The TNM stage classifi cation for renal cell cancer T Primary tumour T1a Tumour 4cm; renal limited T1b Tumour 4cm, but ≤ 7cm; renal-limited T2a Tumour ≥ 7cm, but ≤ 10cm; renal-limited T2b Tumour ≥ 10cm; renal-limited T3a Invades renal vein or branches, or perirenal fat, but not beyond Gerota s fascia T3b Extends into vena cava below the diaphragm T3c Extends into vena cava wall or vena cava above the diaphragm T4 Invades beyond Gerota s fascia, including extension into adrenal gland N Regional nodes N0 No regional node involvement N1 Single regional node N2 More than one regional node M Distant metastases M0 No distant metastases M1 Distant metastases Fuhrmans nuclear grade Grading, according to histological criteria, also predicts survival. Fuhrman s grading (1 4) is the most widely used. Tumour subtype Tumour subtype may also infl uence the prognosis of localized disease, e. g. chromophobe survival papillary clear cell. Other Poor patient performance status and paraneoplastic symptoms are adverse prognostic indicators. Molecular and cytogenetic markers are likely to play a progressively more important role in the future. 748 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology Renal carcinoma: management and follow-up Management Management is directed by the possibility of cure b ased principally on tumour staging. For localized disease, surgical resection alone may be curative. Unfortunately, tumours are often already locally advanced or metastatic at presentation. Recurrence after resection is not uncommon. Surgery Radical nephrectomy is the conventional approach and preferred when evidence of local invasion (e. g. renal vein, perinephric fat, or adrenal). Partial nephrectomy (open or laparoscopic) may be favoured for smaller, non-invasive tumours. Outcomes are Good and local recurrence rates Low.

Cytokines Systemic treatment of RCC is one of the most rapidly evolving areas in medical oncology. Enrolment into approved clinical trials should be encouraged. Cytokine therapy (IFNA 9 IL-2) was the standard fi rst-line systemic therapy until relatively recently. Mechanism of action is unknown but probably involves induction of anti-tumour immunity. However, response rates were Low and relatively short-lived. Remission in 7 10%. High-dose IL-2 causes signifi cant toxicity ( l proinfl ammatory cytokine cascades). 2 Side effects common and often severe ( d blood pressure, arrhythmias, dyspnoea, fever, nausea, i serum creatinine, CNS toxicity, skin rashes). IFNA SE: fl u-like symptoms (fever, malaise, myalgia, etc. ). RENAL CARCINOMA: MANAGEMENT AND FOLLOW-UP 749 Molecularly targeted therapy Improved understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of RCC has identifi ed VEGF and mTOR as targets for therapeutic intervention. Systemic therapy targeting VEGF is now the standard of care for fi rst-line treatment of metastatic RCC. There are two approaches to VEGF inhibition: Blockade of intracellular VEGF signalling through tyrosine kinase inhibition, e. g. sunitinib, sorafenib, and pazopanib. Sunitinib and pazopanib are NICE-approved and have become fi rst-line treatment. SE: i blood pressure, renal and hepatic toxicity, thromboembolism, cardiac toxicity, thyroid dysfunction, GI toxicity, skin rashes. Monoclonal Abs to circulating VEGF (e. g. bevacizumab). Rare in the UK. Temsirolimus and everolimus inhibit mTOR and provide an option if disease progresses despite VEGF inhibition (SE: nausea, anorexia, anaemia, pneumonitis). Follow-up Surveillance for local and contralateral recurrence as well as metastatic disease is mandatory. The frequency of follow-up appointments and repeat imaging is based on risk stratifi cation for each given clinical scenario. Several algorithms have been developed to assist this process. Wilms tumour (nephroblastoma) Embryonal neoplasm arising in the Kidney. It is the commonest renal malignancy in children and represents 7 8% of all childhood cancer. Peak age 3 4 years (rare age 10). . More common in a number of congenital syndromes, but these still represent only a small proportion of the total. WT1 was the initial Wilms associated gene identifi ed. However, the situation is much more complex, with several others now known. Clinical features: 7 3/4 present with an abdominal mass (often noticed by a parent). 7 1/2 report abdominal Pain. i blood pressure ( l tumour renin production), haematuria, fever. Staging delineates local spread and presence of metastases (particularly pulmonary). X Diagnostic biopsy not always undertaken (although desirable if preoperative chemotherapy is under consideration).

In addition, prospective assessment of the long-term side effects of anthracycline-based chemotherapy (e. g. cardiac function) is mandatory. 750 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology Tumours of the bladder: overview Bladder cancer is the second commonest malignancy of the urinary tract and one of the top fi ve cancers in the UK and USA. Median age: 70; 2. 5 : 1 . Caucasians black people (although prognosis worse in the latter). 90% are transitional cell cancers (TCCs), derived from urothelium. Although the bladder is the most common site, TCCs can arise anywhere from the renal pelvis to the urethra ( b p. 756). Squamous cell cancers (SCCs), often s to chronic schistosomal infection, are much more common in developing countries (7 75% cases). SCCs can also be secondary to stone disease and other causes of chronic infl ammation. Prognosis is varied, depending on histology and staging. Low-grade, superfi cial tumours have a very different outcome from High-grade invasive ones. TCCs have one of the highest recurrence rates of any malignancy. Risk factors Transitional cell (TCC) 2 7 80% of TCCs are associated with an environmental exposure. Cigarette smoking is the most important (by far) and associated with a 4-fold risk (relevant carcinogens include B -naphthylamine and 4-aminobiphenyl). Aromatic amines, aniline dyes, and hydrocarbons. Occupations at i risk include: petroleum industry and lorry drivers (diesel fumes), plumbers, metal workers, dry cleaners, painters, hairdressers, rubber, textile and leather industry workers. Urban rural areas. Previous haemorrhagic cystitis from cyclophosphamide therapy ( l acrolein; a carcinogenic urinary metabolite. Mesna inactivates urinary acrolein and may be used as chemoprophylaxis). Previous pelvic radiotherapy. Prolonged immunosuppression (e. g. transplant recipient). Late risk after bladder augmentation procedure (e. g. ileocystoplasty). Phenacetin (an analgesic), prior to its withdrawal. X High fl uid intake may dilute carcinogens, reducing urothelial exposure and 6 risk. Squamous cell (SCC) Squamous metaplasia l i risk of SCC. Causes: chronic cystitis, bladder stones, long-term urinary catheters. Schistosoma haematobium infection is responsible for the majority worldwide, particularly the Middle East. Genetics Several genetic mutations have been identifi ed. Altered tumour suppressor expression, e. g. p53 (chromosome 17). Deletion of 9p21 (site of tumour suppressor p16). Aneuploidy of chromosomes 3, 7, and 17. Altered c-myc and c-jun oncogene expression. TUMOURS OF THE BLADDER: OVERVIEW 751 Clinical features Haematuria: Painless visible haematuria in 7 80% patients. 7 15% patients presenting with macroscopic haematuria will have bladder cancer. 5% patients presenting with microscopic haematuria will have bladder cancer. Irritative symptoms (b p. 78), e. g. frequency, urgency, nocturia, dysuria. More advanced disease: Pain, pelvic mass, systemic symptoms (weight loss, Fatigue, anorexia, etc. ). Investigations Urine cytology: 100mL freshly voided Urine. Avoid fi rst morning sample. Sensitivity is quite Low and centre-dependent. Sensitivity increases for higher-grade tumours ( l pleomorphism and increased nuclear: cytoplasmic ratio). Urinary biomarkers: Novel Protein and genetic markers are gradually expanding their diagnostic utility. They include tumour cell-associated antigens (via immunohistochemistry) and genetic abnormalities (via fl uorescence in situ hybridization Fish). Many identifi ed but few routinely available. Further proof of clinical utility is required. Commercially available tests include: (i) a Fish assay with probes for chromosomes 3, 7, 17, and 9p21 and (ii) a quantitative immunoassay for nuclear matrix Protein (NMP-22), a housekeeping Protein active during cell division.

May have a role in detection/monitoring of metastases. 752 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology Tumours of the bladder: pathology and management Pathology TCC (90%) SCC (5%) adenocarcinoma (2%) sarcomas (rare) small cell (rare). TCC has a range of phenotypic expressions: papillary ( 7 70%), sessile ( 7 10 2 0%), nodular ( 7 10%), or carcinoma i n situ (CIS). The usual growth pattern is papillary, projecting out into the bladder lumen. This may gradually invade deeper, breaching basement membrane, lamina propria, and, eventually, muscle, prior to distant spread. Often multifocal. 7 30% tumours are synchronous at presentation (s to the fi eld change effect of environmental exposures). WHO classifi es tumours pathologically as Low-grade (formerly grades 1 2) or High-grade (grade 3). Low-grade tumours rarely progress to more aggressive, muscle-invasive forms (see Table 9. 10). The term superfi cial tumour is misleading and best avoided. Lowand High-grade tumours follow different biological pathways, have different outcomes, and require different treatments, regardless of superfi ciality. 2 CIS does not imply early disease or a Good outcome it is often characterized by High-grade dysplasia and a poor prognosis. Many patients with CIS have coexisting papillary tumours ( pure CIS in 10%). Staging and prognosis The most signifi cant prognostic factors are: (i) depth of invasion (stage); (ii) histological grade; (iii) presence of CIS; (iv) previous recurrences. Progression risk relates to grade. Low-grade 10% progression (rarely invade muscle). High-grade 30% progression. The majority of tumours (70%) are non-muscle-invasive at diagnosis. Non-muscle-invasive tumours have a relatively Good prognosis, with 5-year survival rates of 80%. Tumours are much more likely to recur than progress. 5-year survival deteriorates to 25% by stage T4. Prognosis therefore depends on both stage and grade. As a rough guide, for superfi cial tumours: Ta Low grade: prognosis very Good. Ta High grade: prognosis less Good. T1 Low grade: prognosis Good. T1 High grade: prognosis poor. Diffuse CIS l higher recurrence rates and poorer prognosis. 7 50% with muscle-invasive disease have occult metastases at diagnosis. Prognosis for those with distant disease is poor (10% alive at 2 years).

Larger tumours require more extensive resection. Should be followed with a single dose of intravesical chemotherapy (e. g. mitomycin) to d recurrence risk (administered within 6h of resection). Repeat TURBT at 7 6 weeks if: (i) residual tumour; (ii) no muscle in initial specimen ( l risk of understaging); (iii) High-grade disease. Subsequent treatment depends on the risk of recurrence and progression. Broadly: Low-risk (Ta staging, 3 lesions, 3cm, Low-grade dysplasia, papillary): follow with active surveillance. High-risk (T1 staging or above, CIS, 3 lesions, 3cm, High-grade dysplasia, non-papillary): further intravesical treatment. Usually immunotherapy with bacille Calmette Gu é rin (BCG). Usually induction treatment weekly for 6 weeks (/ intermittent maintenance therapy for 13 years). Reduces progression risk by 7 25% (SE: cystitis, haematuria, fever, arthralgia, hepatitis, and pneumonitis). 754 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology Muscle-invasive disease (or failure of conservative treatment) Radical cystectomy with urinary diversion Bladder removed with local lymph node dissection. The prostate and seminal vesicles are also removed in (SE: impotence), and cervix, uterus, ovaries, and anterior vagina in . Commonly performed as open surgery, but laparoscopic and robotic techniques are becoming well established. Operative mortality of 25%, but overall perioperative morbidity (cardiovascular, atelectasis, sepsis, bowel and Urine leaks, bleeding, wound infections) highly signifi cant ( 7 30 60%). There is evidence that neoadjuvant chemotherapy has a role prior to surgery, and it should be considered in all suitable patients. Urinary diversion: Ileal conduit: a segment of ileum is used to create a stoma. Orthotopic neobladder: pouch formed from bowel and connected to the urethra (prostatic urethral disease precludes this option). Continent cutaneous pouch: similar to neobladder, but externalization using bowel (often appendix) allows drainage via a catheter. Metastatic disease is treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. In patients who are not considered to be candidates for cystectomy, bladder preservation with a radical TURBT / chemotherapy may be an option. Radical external beam radiotherapy Generally reserved for those unfi t for surgery, in a poor prognostic group, or needing palliation of local symptoms (e. g. haematuria). Follow-up See b p. 757. Bladder adenocarcinoma Uncommon; 2% malignant bladder tumours. Varied histologic patterns, but most often a glandular (enteric) morphology. Need to be differentiated from metastatic adenocarcinoma; e. g. prostate, colon. May arise from urachal remnant. Tend to be aggressive with extra-vesical extension at presentation. Treatment is surgical, with or without adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. TUMOURS OF THE BLADDER: PATHOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT 755 756 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology Tumours of the renal pelvis and ureter Overview Tumours can arise anywhere from renal calyces to the vesicoureteric junction. 70% occur in the distal ureter, 25% mid, and 5% upper. Multicentric disease common, but bilateral tumours rare. 7 5% of patients with bladder cancer will develop an upper tract lesion (higher for CIS). 7 30 40% of patients with an upper tract lesion will develop a bladder tumour ( l s to fi eld transformation effect and downstream seeding). Risk factors and genetics refl ect those for bladder cancer ( b p. 750) There are additional associations with Balkan endemic nephropathy ( b p. 582), aristocholic, or Chinese herb, nephropathy (b p. 583) and Lynch syndrome. Clinical features Frank haematuria (60%). Flank Pain s obstruction (30%). Lower urinary tract symptoms are uncommon. Many patients are asymptomatic.

    "text": "Pathophysiology Remains incompletely understood. Heightened sensitivity to multiple growth factors and cytokines appear important. Androgen dependency is particularly well described. 5 A -reductase converts testosterone l dihydrotestosterone (DHT) within the prostate. Prostatic DHT levels are not increased, but androgen receptor expression is demonstrably more abundant in hyperplastic glands. BPH is rare in with hypogonadism. Proliferation (stromal epithelial) occurs primarily in the peri-urethral transitional zone. Impaired apoptosis may also contribute to cell accumulation. Twin studies suggest a partial genetic susceptibility. LUTS result from: Bladder outlet obstruction. Bladder dysfunction: i fi lling pressures l bladder wall hypertrophy, trabeculation, poor compliance ( d smooth muscle, i collagen), detrusor overactivity (sensitivity to small Urine volumes), and, eventually, incomplete voiding. A -adrenergic receptor stimulation in prostatic smooth muscle and 1 the bladder neck l i smooth muscle tone. Clinical features 2 BPE adversely affects the quality of life of many over age 50. LUTS refresher: frequency, urgency, nocturia, poor or intermittent stream, dribbling, incomplete bladder emptying (see b p. 78). Not all men with LUTS have BPE (and not all men with BPE have LUTS). Prostatic volume and symptoms tend to increase over time. More severe symptoms are commoner in black men. Severity and response to treatment can be assessed with the international prostate symptom score (IPSS) (see Box 9. 3). The fi nal question relates to quality of life and is a strong determinant of the need for intervention. Erectile dysfunction is commonly associated with LUTS. BENIGN PROSTATIC ENLARGEMENT: GENERAL 759 Ask about medications (diuretics, anticholinergics, tricyclics, opiates) and lifestyle factors (caffeine, alcohol, excess liquid intake). A self-completed voiding diary undertaken over a few days can further assess symptoms, liquid intake, and bladder capacity. Diaries can also serve as a platform for subsequent self-management. Complications Bladder dysfunction, post-void residual Urine volumes, acute urinary retention, recurrent UTIs, obstructive nephropathy, bladder stones, haematuria. Differential diagnosis Prostate: prostate cancer, prostatitis, prostatodynia. Bladder: overactive bladder (see b p. 765), bladder dysfunction (e. g. neurological disorder), tumour, stone, foreign body (e. g. stent). Urethra: stricture (previous trauma, STD).

Investigations Urinalysis and MSU for M, CS. PSA: BPH does not cause prostate cancer, but at risk for BPH are also at risk for prostate cancer. PSA levels correlate with prostate volume, so PSA is less specifi c for cancer in an individual with BPH. May help predict response to treatment. Measurement is recommended in many guidelines. Discuss with patient, and interpret in conjunction with DRE. May be helpful if treatment with an 5α-reductase inhibitor is being considered, as these would be expected to reduce the PSA by 50% after 6 months. estimated glomerular filtration rate: Renal insuffi ciency is uncommon so not universally indicated at initial presentation (exception: High residual volume). USS: Prostate and bladder volumes may predict response to treatment. Exclude hydronephrosis if retention or d estimated glomerular filtration rate. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS): For detailed volumetric assessment. Desirable prior to surgery and 5α-reductase inhibitors (see b p. 761). Consider if i PSA. Upper tract imaging: If haematuria, stones, d estimated glomerular filtration rate, large residual volume, upper tract infection. Maximal fl ow rate (Qmax) and fl ow pattern: Useful for initial assessment and to gauge response to treatment. 15mL/s is normal. The shape of the fl ow pattern curve may help differentiate BOO from impaired bladder function. Urodynamics (Hypertension fl ow studies): Invasive (urethral catheter and transrectal probe). Differentiates BOO from detrusor dysfunction (BOO: i voiding pressures (60cmH O) and d Qmax (15mL/s)). 2 BPE: INVESTIGATION AND MANAGEMENT 761 Consider if complications, such as incontinence, or accurate prediction of surgical outcome is desirable (e. g. High-risk candidate). Flexible cystoscopy: If atypical features (e. g. haematuria), prior to invasive treatment, or if an alternative diagnosis (e. g. stricture) is being considered. Management Overview Patients with minor symptoms (IPSS score 7), no complications, and an acceptable quality of life are managed with adaptive lifestyle measures and watchful waiting. Reassess at least annually. Lifestyle measures: d liquid intake (particularly night-time); modify diuretic therapy; d caffeine and alcohol; void prior to bedtime, travel, or meetings. Improve glycaemic control in diabetic patients. Failed lifestyle measures, or moderate to severe symptoms (IPSS score ≥ 8) can be treated with drug therapy. A 3 6 point reduction in IPSS score can be expected ( 7 60% men report an improvement).

BPE: INVESTIGATION AND MANAGEMENT 765 The overactive bladder Introduction An important syndrome defi ned by symptoms: urinary urgency (9 incontinence) dominates, usually with frequency (≥ 8x in a 24h period) and sometimes with nocturia (≥ 3x at night). Urgency is a sudden, overwhelming, desire to pass Urine. It is an unpleasant symptom that has a debilitating impact on quality of life. Pathophysiology appears multifactorial, but involves detrusor overactivity. Possible mechanisms: increased muscarinic sensitivity, overactive afferent sensory pathways and subtle urothelial dysfunction. Investigation 2 Infection should always be excluded: urinalysis, MSU for M, CS. Bladder diary, symptom questionnaires (many available), Other: assessment of post-void residual volume (usually USS further assessment may be necessary if 150mL), urodynamics (characteristic phasic increases in detrusor activity) 9 cystoscopy in atypical or refractory cases. Management Lifestyle modifi cations Modify amount and timing of fl uid intake, absorbent pads if incontinence, double void techniques (if residual volume). Bladder training. This is an organised regime of voiding that can be highly successful, but requires (persistent) patient motivation. Pelvic fl oor muscle therapy improves urethral sphincter control and may be effective, esp. in younger patients. Use in conjunction with biofeedback electrodes (abdominal, anal, vaginal) is common.

In addition, this belief may only hold true for populations where PSA testing is High and not where men present with symptomatic disease. Prostate cancer is the second commonest cause of cancer death in men in the UK after lung cancer. However, the clinical phenotype ranges from microscopic, slow-growing, well-differentiated tumours to aggressive cancers with rapid local invasion and distant spread. This has meant that screening for prostate cancer has become a very controversial topic. Epidemiology Incidence has risen steadily since the mid-1970s. Reasons: ageing population, improved cancer registries, improved diagnostic accuracy, incidental cancer histology of prostate chips at TURP. But, most importantly, the widespread use of PSA testing (and TRUS biopsies) has led to the diagnosis of cancers that would not previously have come to clinical attention during a man s lifetime. Very rare age 40, uncommon age 50. Common age 80 (found at post-mortem in 80%). 7 1 in 6 will develop the disease, and 7 1 in 25 will die from it. Average age at diagnosis 70 74, average age at death 80 84. A variation in the prevalence of prostate cancer around the world (Europe, USA, and Australia Asia and North Africa) suggests genetic factors. Black men white men Asian men (possibly s to hormonal differences). Familial predisposition also occurs (7 5 10% cases). Such patients tend to present 7 5 10 years earlier. X Other risk factors may have a limited role: obesity, diet (High in animal fat, Low in vegetables), and hormones (there appear to be no differences in serum androgen concentrations, but the use of 5 A -reductase inhibitors for BPH reduces prostate cancer incidence overall, albeit with an increase in higher-grade tumours). Genetics There is evidence for a genetic component, but the identifi cation of specifi c genes has proved diffi cult. Risk is increased x 2 in with ≥ 1 affected fi rst-degree relatives. Risk increases with the number of affected family members, especially if relatives are diagnosed at a young age (60). There is a High rate of disease concordance in identical twins. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (e. g. in the 8q24 and 17q regions) are associated with an increased risk (the more SNPs present, the higher the risk). The presence of BRCA1 and (particularly) BRCA2 mutations appears to increase risk (and worsen prognosis). PROSTATE CANCER: GENERAL 767 Recently, a novel G84E mutation in the transcription factor H OXB13 in the 17q region has been associated with a signifi cantly increased risk of hereditary prostate cancer.",

    "text": "Pathology High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is a precursor of malignancy. It is intermediate between normal prostate epithelium and cancer. 95% adenocarcinomas. 4% have transitional cell morphology (arising from prostatic urethral urothelium). Squamous cell and neuroendocrine tumours are very rare. 70% arise in the peripheral, 15 20% in the central, and 10 15% in the transitional zone. Many cancers are multifocal, involving multiple zones. Local invasion causes spread into the bladder neck (transition zone tumours) and ejaculatory ducts and seminal vesicles (peripheral zone tumours). Capsular penetration, with spread along the perineural or vascular spaces, occurs relatively late. Metastasizes to bone more commonly than any other site, causing sclerotic lesions. The natural history of the disease is extremely variable. Some Low-grade tumours follow an indolent course, whilst others rapidly invade and metastasize. Clinical features Prostate cancers are often identifi ed in asymptomatic patients, following an abnormal screening PSA level or DRE (or as an incidental pathologic fi nding at TURP). Local disease LUTS (often late and more likely to be s to BPE), erectile dysfunction, haematospermia. Urinary retention, back or leg Pain, and frank haematuria were more common in the pre-PSA European Renal Association. Advanced disease Weight loss and anorexia. Anaemia. Bone marrow suppression. Skeletal Pain. Spinal cord compression. Leg Edema and Pain s to venous and lymphatic obstruction. Uraemic symptoms from obstructive uropathy. Physical examination DRE: nodules, changes in texture, asymmetry. Obliteration of the lateral sulcus or seminal vesical involvement indicates locally advanced disease. (cid: 2) Many cancers are found in glands that feel normal. Furthermore, an abnormal prostate on DRE should always be investigated, even if the PSA is normal (7 20% patients). Distended bladder. Abnormal lower limbs or neurological fi ndings. 768 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology Prostate cancer: investigation Investigations Urine for M, CS. PSA ( b p. 772). UE, estimated glomerular filtration rate, Ca2 , alkaline phosphatase (skeletal involvement). Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS): Used to evaluate abnormalities on DRE and to guide biopsy. Tumours are often, but not universally, hypoechoic. Also permits gland volume measurement. Useful prior to focal therapy (e. g. cryotherapy) and for the detection of seminal vesicle invasion or extracapsular extension. Biopsy is usually necessary, regardless of TRUS appearances, as TRUS alone is not suffi ciently sensitive. TRUS-guided biopsy: Indicated for tissue diagnosis in those with i PSA or abnormal DRE. Performed as an ambulatory technique under LA. Extended biopsy protocols, with more extensive sampling, is now the norm. These usually involve the removal of at least 10 12 cores. Repeat biopsy may be necessary. A transperineal (total protein) approach is also commonly used and has the advantage of allowing additional samples to be taken (particularly when a TRUS biopsy has proved inconclusive). Complications: haematospermia (common), haematuria, Pain, 1 infection, voiding diffi culties, PR bleeding. Imaging: USS preand post-micturition (with fl ow rate) upper tracts if signifi cant BOO or residual bladder volume. Further imaging contributes to pre-treatment staging: Both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can detect local tumour invasion and lymphadenopathy. magnetic resonance imaging generally provides more accurate T staging. Endorectal magnetic resonance imaging, via an endorectal probe, improves spatial resolution of magnetic resonance imaging for zonal anatomy, extracapsular extension, and seminal vesicle involvement. Pre-biopsy 3-Tesla multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging is increasingly used to identify suspicious areas that can subsequently be targeted for TRUS or total protein-biopsy. These scans can also generate a cancer risk score. MR spectroscopy imaging (MRSI), a technique that utilizes metabolite ratios within prostate tissue to distinguish normal from malignant tissue, has an evolving role.",

Prostascint scan: a radiolabelled mAb to prostate-specifi c membrane antigen can localize soft tissue metastases. FDG-PET has only limited utility: tracer uptake is variable, and accumulation in the bladder obscures the area of interest. PROSTATE CANCER: INVESTIGATION 769 Staging Staging guides initial therapy and is undertaken using the TNM system. In addition, histological grade is determined from biopsy specimens, using the Gleason score. Gleason grade is based on the extent to which the epithelium has a normal glandular structure (1 5). Experience and skill on the part of the pathologist is essential. Based on growth pattern and degree of differentiation, tumours are graded from 1 to 5 where grade 1 is the most and grade 5 the least differentiated. Adding together the values for the two most prevalent patterns of differentiation derives a composite Gleason score, e. g. for a biopsy consisting of predominant grade 4 and secondary grade 3 disease, the composite score is 4 3, or 7. 2 4 Low-grade or well-differentiated; 5 7 moderate grade or moderately differentiated; 8 10 High-grade or poorly differentiated. In the TNM classifi cation, anatomic staging is undertaken both clinically (computed tomography) and pathologically (patient) (see Table 9. 12). computed tomography (based on DRE, imaging, and TRUS biopsy) informs initial treatment decisions but may underestimate disease extent. patient (restaging at prostatectomy) provides a more exact assessment.

With this in mind, the 2010 TNM classifi cation uses clinical stage, Gleason score, and PSA to inform fi ve prognostic groups. Other models have previously been developed to predict higher risk disease. Examples: Memorial Loan-Kettering Cancer Center risk groups (M ) and Partin tables (M ). There is also growing interest in molecular prognostic markers, such as p53, E-cadherin, cathepsin-D, and angiogenesis (microvessel density). Overall, 5-year survival for Low-volume, localized disease (often detected through screening) is 100% but 7 30% in those with metastases. PROSTATE CANCER: INVESTIGATION 771 772 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology Prostate cancer: screening Introduction Cancer screening Successful screening requires accurate, acceptable, and cost-effective tests that identify clinically relevant cancers at a preclinical stage. Treatments should be available that can improve outcomes when administered early (and not cause harm). Prostate cancer screening rationale Early detection and management of asymptomatic prostate cancer through screening could reduce morbidity and mortality, compared to treatment instituted at the time of clinical presentation and diagnosis.

    "text": "Developed for cancer surveillance, but use as a screening tool grew rapidly: by 2001, 75% aged 50 in the USA had undergone testing.

It is diffi cult to defi ne a normal range for PSA it is a continuum that increases with age 40 ( (cid: 2) a normal PSA does not rule out cancer). Nonetheless, 0 4. 0ng/mL is the generally accepted range (see Box 9. 4). A PSA of 4. 0ng/mL gives: 7 20% sensitivity and 7 90% specifi city for prostate cancer.

Requires TRUS or endorectal magnetic resonance imaging to determine prostate volume, so a specialist tool only. Free PSA. PSA exists in a free, as well as bound, form. The ratio of free to total PSA is reduced in men with cancer (25%). Age- (or race-) specifi c reference ranges, for example: Age 50 59: 0 3. 0ng/mL; age 60 69: 0 4. 0ng/mL; age 70: 0 5. 0ng/mL. PROSTATE CANCER: SCREENING 773 Potential benefi ts May detect prostate cancer before symptoms manifest. May detect early cancer, enabling cure or life-extending treatment. Why the ongoing controversy? Screening is certainly associated with detection of more cancers, but: PSA testing was introduced without evidence from clinical trials. Although patchy observational data lend support to screening, the two largest randomized controlled studies have proved inconsistent. The European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) demonstrated a 20% d in mortality in men aged 55 69 after 9 years. It suggested saving one life would require diagnosis and treatment in 48 men. The United States Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial has found no benefi t after 13 years. Neither study is fl awless both have been subjected to criticism. A signifi cant number of tumours detected are clinically indolent, i. e. unlikely to cause clinical illness during a man s lifetime. The ideal screening investigation would identify asymptomatic men with aggressive localized tumours. PSA testing falls short of this aspiration, as it cannot differentiate slow-growing from aggressive cancers. PSA screening has inadequate sensitivity and specifi city. Optimal screening intervals are unclear. PSA testing is not cancer-specifi c (also elevated in benign conditions) or diagnostic (it triggers further diagnostic investigation, i. e. biopsy). It is not clear if it should be combined with DRE for initial screening (variably recommended in international guidelines). The optimal treatment for early cancer is unknown active surveillance might be as Good as radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy. However, the majority with an early-stage cancer (understandably) opt for aggressive treatment. Such (over-) treatment can cause harm.

Guidelines Routine screening is not currently recommended in the UK. Rather, a programme of informed choice is suggested, i. e. men concerned about prostate cancer should receive clear and balanced information about the pros and cons of PSA testing. In the USA, both the American Cancer Society and American Urological Association advocate screening. However, the infl uential Preventative Services Task Force has recently recommended against it. This has refuelled an already long running debate in a country where prostate cancer screening costs an estimated 3 billion annually. In general, screening, or at least a discussion about screening, is recommended for men aged ≥ 50 on an annual basis, unless life expectancy is 10 years (through comorbidity or age 75). Discussions should begin age 40 4 5 in black men or those with a family history. 774 CHAPTER 9 Essential urology Prostate cancer: management Overview The overall direction of treatment should be guided by: Life expectancy (as determined by age and comorbidity). Predictions of tumour aggressiveness. Informed patient choice (see Table 9. 13 for risk stratifi cation). Localized (prostate-limited) disease Overall 10-year survival is 90%. Treatments include radical prostatectomy, radiation (either brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy), and active surveillance. If any offers an advantage is controversial.

PSA post-prostatectomy should be 0. 2ng/mL and post-radiation 0. 5ng/mL. PSA doubling time may also be used as an indicator of the need for salvage treatment. Locally advanced (non-prostate-limited) disease Androgen ablation with radiotherapy is generally advocated. Prostatectomy may be appropriate in selected cases. Metastatic disease The goals are to control symptoms and slow further progression. Treatment modalities See Table 9. 14 for management options. PROSTATE CANCER: MANAGEMENT 775 Watchful waiting Monitoring with hormonal manipulation and palliation when disease progression occurs. Usually reserved for elderly, comorbid patients. Active surveillance Defi nitive treatment (surgery/radiation) is deferred until evidence of progression, with the aim of avoiding unnecessary complications in those whose cancers may not progress. PSA is performed 3 6-monthly and DRE annually. Most protocols include repeat biopsy(s). Radical prostatectomy The prostate and seminal vesicles are completely removed. Lymph node sampling and dissection is often undertaken. Retropubic approach: open or laparoscopic technique, the latter often with robotic assistance. Perineal approach: less Pain, hidden scar, and shorter hospital stay, but less access to lymph nodes. Complications: impotence, stricture, urinary and faecal incontinence.

More accurately, total body Water (TBW) in litres can be estimated as weight (kg) x a correction factor, as in Table 10. 1. Table 10. 1 Estimation of TBW 65 years old 0. 6 0. 5 65 years old 0. 5 0. 45 So, in a 70kg 65 years old, TBW 0. 6 x 70 42L. Water is contained in specifi c compartments: Intracellular space ( 7 2/3 TBW, or 28L in a 70kg ). Extracellular fl uid is then 7 1/3 TBW, or 14L in a 70kg . This includes: Interstitial fl uid ( 7 2/3 ECF Water, or 9. 4L in a 70kg ). Plasma ( 7 1/3 ECF Water, or 4. 6L in a 70kg ). The hydrophobic cell membrane acts as a barrier between intraand extracellular fl uid, and the capillary wall separates plasma from the interstitium. Every compartment maintains osmotic Hypertension through an actively retained specifi c solute: Intracellular: potassium (pumped inwards by sodium /potassium ATPase). ECF: sodium (see next paragraph). Plasma: proteins (esp. albumin, impermeable through the normal endothelial barrier). Extracellular volume is controlled by sodium retention and excretion (Water will passively follow salt). The body ignores the ECF as a whole and samples a portion of it: the effective arterial Blood volume (EABV). 1 Amounts to 7 700mL (Blood in the arterial tree at any one time).",

Changes in EABV (due to hypovolaemia, d CO, or d SVR) are sensed by: Systemic baroreceptors (carotid sinus, aortic arch). Intrarenal volume sensors (juxtaglomerular apparatus). With d EABV, these volume sensors activate the sympathetic nervous system, with sodium then retained by the Kidney (often to u-sodium 10mmol/L). Conversely, with i EABV, salt wasting (100mmol/L) takes place with appropriate changes in TBW. This requires intact renal salt handling (and Kidney function) for such homeostasis. Low-Hypertension volume receptors, sited in the atria and the great veins ( NOT contributing to EABV sensing), are also important: i ECF leads to increased atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) release and renal salt wasting, as well as suppressing sympathetic tone. These receptors may control non-osmotic ADH release if the ECF is underfi lled. Sodium: SALT AND Water BALANCE 779 Falling EABV increases sympathetic tone i circulating catecholamines, leading to i CO and i SVR. Activated renin angiotensin system, improving renal haemodynamics and salt retention through s hyperaldosteronism. i non-osmotic ADH (vasopressin) release. Rising EABV (including Low-Hypertension whole ECF sensing) i ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide, a potent natriuretic). Suppressed renin production and thus angiotensin and aldosterone. Water handling TBW is mainly regulated by cerebral (circumventricular) and peripheral osmoreceptors ( not volume sensors) capable of sensing changes in ECF osmolality: i osmolality triggers thirst and pituitary ADH (vasopressin) release. Relatively dilute Urine arrives at the collecting duct, as sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle occurs without Water (this is the basis for the countercurrent mechanism, leading to a hypertonic medullary interstitium). Without ADH, this fl uid is passed, little modifi ed, as Urine (and polyuria of DI ( b p. 789)). ADH binds V (vasopressin) receptors on the 2 basolateral aspect of the principal cells in the collecting duct, leading to translocation of aquaporins to the apical membrane where these Water channels allow free Water absorption along an osmolar gradient into the hypertonic interstitium. With Water loading, osmoreceptors sense a falling osmolality. Thirst and ADH release are suppressed l dilute Urine is formed, rapidly (within 6h) restoring normal osmolality (7 285mOsmol/kg). With Water depletion, osmoreceptors sense i osmolality, trigger ADH release, retain Water, with (highly) concentrated Urine. Increased thirst eventually corrects the absolute Water defi cit. So, for normal Water homeostasis, an individual needs: An intact thirst centre. Access to Water. The ability to secrete ADH (vasopressin). A responsive collecting duct. Abnormalities in one or more of these components l abnormal Water homeostasis. Reference 1. Schrier RW (1988).

As with many electrolyte disorders, d sodium is relatively common in hospitalized patients t his is particularly true for elderly inpatients where up to 6% will have sodium 125. However, even in an apparently healthy elderly (65) population, 7% of people have sodium 137. The effects of ageing on the Kidney may impair free Water excretion or, at least, slow the capacity to excrete a Water load. This may be further exacerbated by prescribed drugs, such as diuretics or NSAIDs. Most hyponatraemic patients are thought to be asymptomatic but perception and gait disturbances increase as sodium falls (and improve with correction).",

HYPERNATRAEMIA 789 Box 10. 1 Diabetes insipidus 2 Polydipsia and polyuria (6L/day) in adults without Diabetes is usually due to DI or psychogenic polydipsia. ADH (also called arginine vasopressin, AVP) binds the V receptor on 2 collecting duct cells, leading to surface expression of free Water channels, or aquaporins, through which Water is rapidly taken up. DI can be cranial (i. e. impaired release of ADH): Trauma or post-operative. Tumours or infi ltrative processes (sarcoid, TB). Infective (meningitis, encephalitis). Cerebral vasculitis (SLE, Wegeners). More commonly, DI is nephrogenic (resistance to ADH). Causes include: Congenital. Drug-induced ( lithium, amphotericin, foscarnet, demeclocycline). Hypokalaemia or hypercalcaemia. Tubulointerstitial disease (medullary cystic disease, b p. 599). Lithium prevents translocation of aquaporins to the collecting duct apical membrane and is the most common cause of nephrogenic DI.

OEDEMA AND ITS TREATMENT 791 Oedema and its treatment Oedema occurs with interstitial expansion of the ECF, becoming clinically apparent if 2L fl uid excess in this compartment. It is most obvious in the dependent areas (ankles), but it may affect the face and eyelids, especially in the morning. Anasarca refers to severe oedema, progressing from the peripheries to the trunk. Oedema may occur with other extravascular signs of salt and Water retention (pleural effusions, ascites). Causes include: Congestive Heart failure. Liver failure. Nephrotic syndrome ( b p. 554). Acute or chronic renal failure ( d glomerular filtration rate l d salt excretion). Drug-induced (NSAIDs, calcium channel blockers). Premenstrual or pregnant (oestrogen effect). Venous insuffi ciency (localized oedema). Development of oedema For oedema to develop, salt and Water retention must occur (to expand the ECF) and/or capillary permeability must increase (to allow fl uid shifts into the interstitium). The overfi ll hypothesis suggests that sodium retention is the primary factor in the development of oedema: any state that leads to d EABV ( b p. 778) l s hyperaldosteronism, sympathetic overactivity, and non-osmotic ADH release. This then causes salt and Water retention, an increase in ECF volume, and oedema. The underfi ll hypothesis explains oedema associated with d albumin as a fall in plasma oncotic Hypertension (provided largely by albumin) with unchanged hydrostatic Hypertension, resulting in fl uid movement into the extravascular space. This then leads to s fl uid retention. Oedema and hypoalbuminaemia in the nephrotic syndrome Experimental evidence suggests the underfi ll hypothesis to be incorrect with d s-albumin: the transcapillary oncotic gradient is maintained with hypoalbuminaemia, as interstitial colloid osmotic Hypertension (COP) is reduced in tandem with falls in the plasma COP (the interstitial fl uid not only maintains a COP countering plasma COP, but can be varied). Rather, infl ammatory cytokines impair capillary permeability, a falling EABV l salt retention, i urinary albumin modifi es sodium handling directly in the nephron, and renal resistance to ANP develops. The net effect is one of salt retention, with equilibration of the expanded ECF into the interstitium. 792 CHAPTER 10 Fluids and electrolytes Diuretics All diuretics block the reuptake of sodium, and thus chloride and Water. All circulate highly Protein-bound and are thus not well fi ltered by the glomerulus. This complex is taken up from the peritubular fl uid by proximal tubular cells and the diuretic released prior to excretion to act in the urinary space (except for spironolactone and other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists). For use in hypertension, see b p. 498. Commonly used diuretics include Loop diuretics Site of action: blocks sodium uptake at the sodium potassium 2Cl (NKCC) co-transporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Specifi c side effects: i u-Ca2 , ototoxicity. Examples: furosemide, bumetanide, torasemide. Thiazide diuretics Site of action: blocks sodium uptake at the sodium chloride co-transporter in the distal tubule. Specifi c side effects: i u-Ca2 (may cause hypercalcaemia). Examples: bendrofl umethiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, metolazone, indapamide. Amiloride/triamterene Site of action: blocks sodium uptake at the apical sodium channel (ENaC) in the collecting duct. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists Site of action: blocks sodium uptake by downregulating apical sodium channel (ENaC) expression in the collecting duct.",

Spironolactone enters cells from the circulation, rather than the urinary space, and binds the intracellular mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Specifi c side effects: i potassium, anti-androgenic effects (not eplerenone). Examples: spironolactone, eplerenone. General side effects include: d potassium ( not with spironolactone), d sodium, d Mg2 , i uric acid, skin rashes, interstitial nephritis, dyslipidaemia ( X insulin resistance, impotence). Using diuretics in oedematous states (cid: 2) Always institute appropriate salt restriction when using diuretics, and consider fl uid restriction to 1, 000mL/day. Assess volume status daily. Measure weight daily to assess response. Strict input/output charts may be helpful. Measure serum electrolytes regularly. Monitoring u-sodium excretion may be helpful in diuretic resistance. DIURETICS 793 (cid: 2) Do not forget bed rest as a useful tool in mobilizing oedema and encouraging diuresis. Nephrotic syndrome Often requires High doses of loop diuretics (furosemide 160 2 40mg daily), as i urinary albumin binds free diuretic. Consider add-on thiazide diuretics (e. g. metolazone 2. 5 5mg/day PO), but beware rapid-onset d sodium , and titrate dose against daily weight loss. X Furosemide and albumin infusions are frequently used in an attempt to improve drug delivery p robably without real benefi t. May be of use if s-albumin 20g/dL. Administer as 100mL 20% human albumin solution, with 40 160mg furosemide IVI, over 2 4 hours. Renal failure Loop diuretic if glomerular filtration rate 50mL/min. May require 240mg PO daily in 2 3 divided doses. Best response with IVI loop diuretic (furosemide 200mg) or as continuous infusion (furosemide 10 50mg/h to a maximum of 500mg/ day to prevent ototoxicity). Bumetanide is better absorbed and should be considered in diuretic resistance (up to 8mg/day). If poor response, consider add-on thiazide, as described in Nephrotic syndrome. Congestive cardiac failure Loop diuretics better than thiazides, e. g. furosemide 40mg od. Evidence from RALES and EPHESUS trials has confi rmed a role for mineralocorticoid receptor blockade, so this class often used as fi rst line. Hyperkalaemia is a real concern, as such patients are often on ACE inhibitors or B -blockers ( b p. 797). Cirrhosis Spironolactone (50 200mg od) prevents s hyperaldosteronism, with add-on thiazide ( not loop too marked a diuresis may precipitate acute renal failure) if required. Resistant ascites is best treated with paracentesis under albumin cover. As it is diffi cult to resorb more than 1L of ascites over a day, a diuresis that sees daily weight loss of 0. 5kg (where 1kg is a surrogate for 1L negative balance through diuresis, and not related to paracentesis) should cause concern over precipitating pre-renal failure. 794 CHAPTER 10 Fluids and electrolytes Potassium potassium is the second most abundant cation in the body (7 3. 5mol). Dietary potassium amounts to 80 150mmol/day. Only around 65mmol is present in the ECF, with the great majority (98%) found within cells in muscle (and, to a lesser extent, Liver, red cells, and bone). Once absorbed, potassium is rapidly buffered by removal from the ECF into the intracellular compartment: insulin and B -adrenergic catecholamines stimulate membrane sodium /potassium -ATPase to pump potassium into cells (in a 3: 2 ratio). This electrochemical gradient (the cell membrane potential) is critical to nerve conduction, muscle contraction, and normal cell function. Total body potassium balance is regulated by renal excretion: potassium is freely fi ltered at the glomerulus (7 700mmol/day) and is reabsorbed by the PCT (75%), the loop of Henle (15%), and the A -intercalated cells of the collecting duct.",

Potassium 795 796 CHAPTER 10 Fluids and electrolytes Hyperkalaemia See b p. 130 for further discussion. True hyperkalaemia is either due to increased release from cells or decreased excretion by the Kidney. Since the release of important trials using spironolactone or eplerenone (in addition to ACE inhibitors) in the treatment of Heart failure, dangerous hyperkalaemia has become more common in those with better renal function. Pseudohypokalaemia 2 i potassium is often spurious: always recheck result. Traumatic venepuncture l cellular potassium leakage and false hyperkalaemia. This l 1 2mmol/L rise in the apparent potassium. Fine-bore needles, tourniquets, and fi st clenching can all induce mechanical release of potassium from cells, as can cold temperature. More common with i WCC (100) or i platelet count (400 x 109 ). Common causes include chronic kidney disease per se. potassium -rich diets (bananas, other fruits) with chronic kidney disease. Drug-induced (esp. combinations of the following): ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blocker. potassium -sparing diuretics (spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride). NSAIDs. Heparin and LMW heparins (inhibit normal aldosterone release). Ciclosporin. High-dose trimethoprim. Digoxin toxicity (but not therapeutic levels of digoxin). B -blockers. Hypoaldosteronism (including type 4 RTA, b p. 825). Addisons. Increased release from cells: Acidosis (lactic). Insulin defi ciency (DKA). Rhabdomyolysis, strenuous exercise, or tumour lysis. Massive haemolysis. Succinylcholine use. HYPERKALAEMIA 797 Hyperkalaemia with aldosterone antagonism RALES and EPHESUS, two major trials demonstrating a 15 30% reduction in mortality due to CCF in patients treated with agents that block the action of aldosterone (spironolactone, eplerenone), launched an European Renal Association of aldosterone antagonism in Heart failure and beyond. Widespread use (occasionally inappropriate) has followed c linical trials have been designed to exclude those with signifi cant renal disease (those most at risk of hyperkalaemia). In 2004, Juurlink et al. described the effects of instituting these trials in less well-defi ned populations with Heart failure in Ontario and demonstrated a 6-fold i in hyperkalaemic deaths. Since ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blocker are also indicated to treat CCF, serious hyperkalaemia may occur. If using such combination therapy: Calculate glomerular filtration rate ( b pp. 3037)caution if abnormal. Stop NSAIDs. Advise about dietary potassium restriction ( b p. 259).

Type 5 Bartters is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. At least six subtypes now detected, all sharing impaired sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Mutations in a number of channels on both the apical and basolateral membranes (including NKCC2, CLC-ketoanalogue and CLC-Kb, CaR, and ROMK) are responsible for salt wasting and mild volume depletion. It is, in effect, what is seen with loop diuretic use. Subsequent s hyperaldosteronism (and juxtaglomerular apparatus hyperplasia) leads to a hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis. i luminal sodium impairs Ca2 absorption, leading to normal to i u-Ca2 .

Extracellular Ca2 accounts for a small fraction: of this; 7 40% is bound to albumin, with 50% available as physiologically active, free (or ionized) calcium 2. The remainder is complexed with anions, such as bicarbonate or phosphate. Free intracellular Ca2 is found at 104 higher a concentration than in the extracellular space, a gradient maintained by an energy-dependent membrane Ca2 ATPase. Intracellular Ca2 is key to many signalling pathways within cells Ca2 is also important in skeletal health, membrane function, neuromuscular integrity, and coagulation. The serum normal range is 2. 1 2. 5mmol/L ( 7 1. 2mmol/L ionized), with Ca2 available from both the gut and bone stores. Gut Ca2 absorption occurs via transcellular (uptake via TRPV6, the apical calcium 2 channel with subsequent energy-dependent basolateral effl ux) and paracellular pathways. Uptake is under the control of (active) 1, 25(OH) vitamin D. 2 3 The ionized fraction is freely fi ltered across the glomerulus and mainly reabsorbed in the PCT and loop of Henle. Most Ca2 is resorbed paracellularly along a concentration gradient, but TRPV5 regulates (the fi nal 10% of total) distal calcium uptake in a parathyroid hormoneand vitamin D-dependent manner. Urinary sodium is able to strongly infl uence urinary calcium 2 excretion: in the thick ascending loop of Henle, i sodium delivery forces i sodium uptake, at the expense of Ca2 resorption l hypercalciuria. This is a key factor in stone formation ( b p. 716). Falling Ca2 activates parathyroid calcium-sensing receptors (CaRs), leading to parathyroid hormone (parathyroid hormone) release. parathyroid hormone increases renal tubular calcium 2 reabsorption and hydroxylation of vitamin D to the active metab3 olite, increasing intestinal uptake. parathyroid hormone also enhances bone osteoclastic activity.",

There is also evidence that parathyroid hormone receptors are present on cells not directly involved in calcium homeostasis (such as endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes), suggesting that parathyroid hormone may have effects beyond its role in calcium/phosphate regulation. Magnesium Magnesium (Mg2 ) is the fourth most common cation in the body and is found largely in the intracellular compartment or stored in bone. Only 1% of the 25g total body Mg2 is in the ECF, with the majority found in bone or muscle. It is a key component of ATP-requiring reactions and is necessary for the synthesis of Protein and maintaining membrane function, nerve conduction, and muscle contraction. Mg2 , like calcium 2, also regulates parathyroid hormone secretion d Mg2 leads to parathyroid hormone release and vice versa. Profound d Mg2 l symptomatic d Ca2 . The normal range is 0. 75 0. 95mmol/L in plasma. The Kidney dominates the control of Mg2 homeostasis. Mg2 is absorbed from the gut and freely fi ltered across the glomerulus. In health, 70% is then reabsorbed in the thick ascending loop of Henle (TALH) the strongly negative paracellular CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM, AND PHOSPHORUS 803 Protein paracellin-1 allows effi cient absorption of the cations Mg2 and calcium 2 under control of both parathyroid hormone and the calcium-sensing receptor. Fine control is achieved in the DCT where the transmembrane (transcellular) Protein TRPM6 allows further uptake. Loss of function of either paracellin-1 or TRPM6 leads to urinary Mg2 wasting and d Mg2 . Phosphorus Phosphorus occurs largely as the inorganic fraction phosphate in the circulation. Organic phosphorus exists as Protein-bound phospholipids and is not measured in clinical practice. Phosphate is essential to almost all biochemical systems. Absorbed by the type II Sodium/phosphate co-transporter (NaPi) from the intestine, again in a vitamin D -dependent manner, 80% is found in 3 bone. The normal range for plasma phosphate is 0. 8 1. 4mmol/L (higher in children). Freely fi ltered in the Kidney, it is largely reabsorbed in the PCT (depending on oral intake) by the type II NaPi. Tubular reabsorption of phosphate is controlled by parathyroid hormone (which inhibits reabsorption) and also by fi broblast growth factor 23 (produced by osteocytes which leads to lower levels of serum phosphate by reducing tubular reabsorption and by inhibition of 1 A -hydroxylation of vitamin D). 804 CHAPTER 10 Fluids and electrolytes Hypocalcaemia Total serum Ca2 is Low with d albumin, though the free fraction may be normal.

HYPOPHOSPHATAEMIA 813 814 CHAPTER 10 Fluids and electrolytes Acidbase Understanding normal physiology The concentration of hydrogen ions (H) is tightly controlled within and without cells, in various tissues and fl uid compartments of the body. A key function of the kidneys is to regulate the Blood H and consequently total body H. pH is the negative logarithmic expression of the concentration of hydrogen ions in any fl uid. In the ECF, pH is maintained within a normal range of 7. 38 7. 42 where H at pH 7. 40 is 40nmol/L at pH 7. 0 (the intracellular pH), H 100nmol/L. Remember the pH of Water is 6. 8 note the role of buffers in biological fl uids. Intake and generation Acid loads can be categorized as volatile (CO ) and non-volatile. 2 Non-volatile acid loads can be subdivided into metabolizable (via intermediary metabolism, e. g. lactic acid) and non-metabolizable (e. g. HCl). Non-metabolizable acid amounts to 1mmol/kg acid/day in adults, largely derived from the breakdown of ingested Protein (sulphur-containing amino acids l H SO ) and by-products of cellular metabolism. 2 4 Metabolizable acids are eventually metabolized to CO and H O, so 2 2 eliminating the acid.

Sodium lactate) to the body are equivalent to the addition of bicarbonate, as a proton will be used to metabolize lactate to CO and H O (resulting 2 2 in a net generation of bicarbonate). It is this principle that allows for the use of acetate and lactate as buffers in various forms of renal replacement therapy. Buffering To prevent rapid changes in pH with i dietary intake or excess production of H , e. g. during exercise, a system of local (tissue) and systemic buffers has evolved. These buffers include: Bicarbonate (HCO ). 3 Bone salts (calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate). Blood proteins (albumin, haemoglobin, and other globulins). In the short term, bicarbonate is, by far, the most important, though bone buffers play a more signifi cant role in chronic acidosis. ACIDBASE 815 Acid maths H HCO H CO CO H O 3 2 3 2 2 Adding H (acidosis) consumes bicarbonate and generates CO, as the 2 reaction is driven rightwards. Removing CO (hyperventilation) returns 2 the pH toward normal, according to the Henderson Hasselbach equation: pH pK log HCO 3 where pK 6. 1, the dissociation coeffi cient of carbonic acid (H CO ). 2 3 This does not generate more bicarbonate, so the Kidney has to i H excretion to balance the system. Models of acidbase balance There are two principal models to explain the physiological acid base balance. The traditional base excess model (see Fig. 10. 1). Stewarts theory see M. Base excess (traditional method) Building on the work of Singer and Hastings, Siggaard Andersen introduced the concept of base excess (BE) in 1960. Defi ned as the number of mmol of acid or base that are needed to titrate 1L of Blood to pH 7. 40 at 37 C in the presence of a p CO of 5. 33kPa (40mmHg). The base 2 excess allows differentiation between metabolic and respiratory acidosis/ alkalosis. The term base defi cit is synonymous with negative values of base excess (i. e. metabolic acidosis). Values for HCO and BE are derived from the directly measured vari3 ables of pH, p CO, and hemoglobin.",

This occurs through: 3 i bicarbonate losses (gut or Kidney). i acid retention. Excessive acid production or administration (HCl). Administration of chloride - rich solutions during resuscitation. With pure metabolic acidosis, compensation occurs through increasing ventilation and blowing off CO ( d p CO ). 2 2 Why do chloride-rich solutions lead to acidosis? Solutions, such as 0. 9% NaCl, normal saline, are bicarbonate-free. Falling bicarbonate is replaced by chloride (chloride ) without a proportional d in p CO. 2 This is a so-called dilution acidosis . In determining the cause of a metabolic acidosis, it is helpful to estimate the anion gap this may be calculated for both the plasma and Urine (UAG, b see below). In health, the difference between cations and anions is made up of organic (negatively charged) acids. An i AG occurs if acids, other than carbonic acid (l phosphate, lactate, or sulphate), accumulate or i exogenous acids are added to plasma.

All net acid excretion occurs in the distal nephron ( b p. 930). See Table 10. 5 for distinguishing types of RTA. Distal RTA (type 1) Disordered excretion of acid (H ) from the A - intercalated cell in the collecting duct leads to acidosis. Presents as a hyperchloraemic, hypokalaemic metabolic acidosis, with hypophosphataemic metabolic bone disease, renal stones, or diffuse nephrocalcinosis (requirement to chronically buffer acidosis l bone buffering). Is (rarely) inherited or, more commonly, acquired secondary to: Sj ö grens syndrome, RA, SLE, and other autoimmune diseases. Nephrocalcinosis (distal RTA is confusingly both a cause and result of nephrocalcinosis) of any cause. Drugs (analgesic nephropathy, ifosfamide, amphotericin, lithium).

    "text": "). Causes include: Mitochondrial dysfunction, either congenital or drug-induced (b p. 829). Thiamine defi ciency. Metabolic derangements involving oxidation: Diabetes mellitus especially when poorly controlled. Ethanol poisoning. Liver impairment. D-lactic acidosis is a rare cause of an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis where bacterial overgrowth in intestinal blind loops leads to increased lactate absorption the proliferating organisms (and not humans) are capable of producing the D-isomer. Management of lactic acidosis Treat the underlying cause there is no role for systemic NaHCO. So the 3 treatment of type A lactic acidosis involves improving oxygenation: resuscitate shock; restore Blood fl ow, and/or improve gas exchange. LACTIC ACIDOSIS 829 Drugs and lactic acidosis Metformin has long been thought to cause a type B lactic acidosis, particularly in diabetics with renal impairment. There is some doubt about this association. However, current NICE recommendations are to stop metformin if serum creatinine 150 μ mol/L (1. 7mg/dL) or estimated glomerular filtration rate 30mL/min/1. 73m2. Recently, reverse transcriptase inhibitors have also been found to cause an often severe lactic acidosis as a result of mitochondrial injury in life-threatening cases (lactate 10mmol/L), consider L-carnitine. Other drugs recognized as causes of type B lactic acidosis: Ethanol, cocaine, paracetamol, salicylate. Zidovudine, didanosine, stavudine, lamivudine, zalcitabine. Propofol, isoniazid. Niacin, nitroprusside, cyanide. Sorbitol and fructose. 830 CHAPTER 10 Fluids and electrolytes Alkalosis Metabolic alkalosis Metabolic alkalosis is common (as might be expected from its causes) and, if severe (pH 7. 55), is associated with mortality as High as 45%. Either retention of base or loss of acid in the ECF leads to a rising serum bicarbonate and pH. To buffer such changes, patients can hypoventilate to i pCO to as much as 7kPa (x 7. 5 for kPa l mmHg). For each 1mmol/L rise in ser 2 um HCO above normal, the pCO will rise by 9 0. 08kPa to buffer 3 2 the alkalosis (e. g. to buffer a serum HCO of 34mmol/L, the pCO will 3 2 need to rise by 0. 8kPa). Causes of a metabolic alkalosis include: With Low chloride: Gastric losses (Vomiting, NG suction, self-induced Vomiting). Diuretics (thiazide, loop diuretics). Diarrhoea (esp. chloride-secreting villous adenoma). Cystic fi brosis. Chloride-losing alkaloses With Vomiting or NG losses, the stomach generates replacement gastric HCl, in the process returning HCO to the ECF. NaCl loss into gastric 3 fl uids l volume contraction as well. Diuretics block NaCl uptake, with ECF depletion ( s hyperaldosteronism) and i salt delivery to the DCT (6 i exchange of sodium for potassium and H ). Diuretic-induced d potassium exacerbates alkalosis further. With Low Potassium: p hyperaldosteronism (and, less commonly, s ). Drugs (carbenoloxone, liquorice, laxative abuse). Bartters, Liddles, and Gitelmans syndromes (b p. 800). Hypokalaemic alkalosis Hyperaldosteronism leads to i sodium retention at the expense of potassium and H. d potassium may increase net acid excretion. The intracellular acidosis found with d potassium leads to i HCO retention 3 in the Kidney. Other: Milk-alkali syndrome (or hypercalcaemia of other causes usually s to calcium and vitamin D-containing preparations, occasionally in association with thiazide diuretic use, the so-called calcium-alkali syndrome). Overzealous bicarbonate therapy (esp. if with chronic kidney disease). Penicillins (cation load l uHCO wasting). 3 Massive transfusion (citrate load). ALKALOSIS 831 Symptoms and signs Often due to associated hypovolaemia or hypokalaemia. With severe alkalosis, d cerebral and myocardial Blood fl ow: headaches, confusion, seizures, angina, arrhythmias. Compensatory hypoventilation and hypocapnoea may be important in critically ill patients (failure to wean off ventilator). O delivery to tissues is reduced (through alkalosis-induced vaso2 constriction and reduced O release the dissociation curve is shifted 2 leftwards).",

Alternatives include tiopronin up to 400mg daily or captopril. All work by increasing cystine solubility. For managing stones, see b p. 722. Cystinosis (cid: 2) Is not the same disease as cystinuria Presents in childhood with growth failure, Fanconi syndrome, and progressive renal impairment. Eye involvement, hepatomegaly, hypothyroidism, and Diabetes develop, as cystine deposits impair organ function. An adolescent variant with normal stature and tubular function, but renal impairment, offers a better renal prognosis. An autosomal recessively inherited defect in cystine export from intracellular lysosomes leads to accumulation and local injury. Oral cysteamine forms a complex with cystine that can leave lysosomes, ameliorating disease. Hyperoxaluria An autosomal recessive condition presenting in childhood marked by i u-oxalate excretion, calcium oxalate calculi, and nephrocalcinosis. Defective synthesis or targeting of the enzyme AGXT, which converts glyoxalate to glycine, leads to compensatory shuttling of glyoxalate to oxalate. Heavy oxalate deposition in the Heart, Blood vessels, and joints causes signifi cant morbidity. The treatment of choice is combined Liver Kidney transplantation, although High-dose pyridoxine offers interim benefi t. Rarely, hyperoxaluria and nephrocalcinosis may be associated with Crohns disease.

Increased cardiac output (up to 50%). Increased plasma volume (up to 30 40%). Increased peripheral vasodilatation, with corresponding decrease in systemic vascular resistance ( l fall in blood pressure and widening of pulse Hypertension during 1st and 2nd trimesters that normalizes during 3rd trimester). The fall in blood pressure is actually modest, in comparison to the increase in CO and intravascular volume, as there is a signifi cant concomitant increase in vascular compliance. Renal changes Increased renal Blood fl ow, up to 70 80% in 2nd trimester (under the infl uence of NO, vasodilator prostaglandins and relaxin). Trans-glomerular capillary Hypertension remains the same, with matching dilatation of both afferent and efferent arterioles. Marked stimulation of RAAS. Increased glomerular filtration rate (40% by end of 1st trimester). Increase in proteinuria. ≤ 300mg/24h is not signifi cant in pregnancy. It is important to quantify baseline pre-existing proteinuria at the start of pregnancy (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio/urine protein-to-creatinine ratio). Pre-existing proteinuria is likely to double. Renal function (See Table 11. 1. ) 1 estimated glomerular filtration rate is not validated in pregnancy: MDRD underestimates, and Cockcroft Gault overestimates, true glomerular filtration rate. 2 serum creatinine 80μmol/L (0. 9mg/dL) or Ur 5mmol/L (14mg/dL) during pregnancy may indicate renal impairment and warrant further evaluation. 24h urinary Creatinine clearance ( b p. 33) remains the gold standard for the measurement of renal function during pregnancy (NR: 125 150mL/min; 30% above range for non-pregnant women).

Pyelonephritis is the most common renal complication of pregnancy, occurring in 1 2% of all pregnancies. In addition, preterm labour or Low birthweight infants may be associated with asymptomatic bacteriuria or UTI (mechanism: possible amnionitis li infl ammatory cytokine synthesis, provoking uterine contraction). Untreated UTI may be associated with subsequent developmental delay in the child and even increased risk of fetal death. Bacteriology 80 90% due to E. coli. Proteus spp. , Klebsiella spp. , or Gram ve organisms may also be implicated. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection near delivery may lead to vaginal colonization and serious neonatal sepsis, so penicillin prophylaxis should be given during labour. Risk factors Asymptomatic bacteriuria (105 cfu/mL Urine) occurs in 4 7% of women and, in pregnancy, is associated with pyelonephritis in 30% of cases, if untreated. Send Urine for culture at fi rst antenatal visit. If asymptomatic bacteriuria is present, send a second sample. If second sample positive, l treat. The absence of bacteriuria at antenatal booking is associated with 2% chance of UTI through pregnancy. Further risk factors for bacteriuria or frank UTI prior to delivery include: UTI before falling pregnant or UTI in previous pregnancies. An abnormal urinary tract. Diabetes mellitus, HIV positivity, or sickle cell disease. Prolonged labour, Cesarean section, pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, and urinary catheters are all risk factors for post-partum UTI. Diagnosis Dysuria, frequency, urgency, or offensive Urine suggests UTI. Loin Pain, backache, Vomiting, and fevers often occur in pyelonephritis. Suprapubic or renal angle tenderness may be present. Dipstick for leucocytes or nitrites may suggest UTI but will often miss asymptomatic bacteriuria. 2 Send MSU for M, CS. If pyelonephritis suspected: Blood cultures, FBC, UE, CRP. Consider USS renal tract. Fetal well-being should be assessed. 3 Acute pyelonephritis Pyelonephritis is more common in the second half of pregnancy and is a signifi cant cause of fetal mortality and maternal morbidity. The increasing size of the uterus may cause ureteral obstruction and impaired urinary fl ow (particularly on the right), encouraging stasis and sepsis. URINARY TRACT INFECTION 843 Recurrent UTIs in pregnancy 2 After more than one UTI (or a single episode in 5 with an abnormal urinary tract), women should be offered prophylactic antibiotics for the duration of the pregnancy. Post-coital cefalexin 500mg PO stat or cefalexin 500mg nocte for 1 month, alternating with nitrofurantoin 100mg nocte, have proved safe and effective.",

Nitrofurantoin (a recent large Norwegian population study suggests Low teratogenic potential but increased risk of neonatal jaundice if used within 30 days of delivery). Trimethoprim (1 safe after 1st trimester ( b p. 843)). 844 CHAPTER 11 Pregnancy and the Kidney acute kidney injury during pregnancy Introduction acute kidney injury during pregnancy remains a signifi cant problem in the developing world, accounting for up to 20% of all acute kidney injury (usually in circumstances where there is no access to safe and sterile termination). 2 In the developed world, pre-eclampsia is the commonest pregnancy-related cause of acute kidney injury. Causes Pre-renal Volume depletion: Esp. s to hyperemesis gravidarum during the 1st trimester. Placental abruption: Presents with abdominal Pain and PV bleeding in 2nd or 3rd trimester. A classical cause of cortical necrosis (b p. 845). Post-partum haemorrhage (see also cortical necrosis, b p. 845). Septic abortion ( b p. 845). Common in the developing world. Presents with abdominal Pain, fever, and shock. Renal Pre-eclampsia ( b p. 850). Acute fatty Liver of pregnancy: 3rd trimester. Presents with coagulopathy, abnormal LFTs, hypoglycaemia, and lactic acidosis. acute kidney injury common. HUS/TTP (b p. 845): May present in either the antenatal or post-natal period. Exacerbation of existing renal disease, e. g. SLE: Renal biopsy may be required to confi rm diagnosis and is safe in early pregnancy in expert hands. Acute interstitial nephritis ( b p. 580): Often drug-related, e. g. NSAIDs, antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors. Nephrotoxic drugs ( b p. 898). Post-renal Acute urinary retention: 3rd trimester. Relates to bulk of expanding uterus. Also occurs following combined Kidney/pancreas transplantation where the transplanted Kidney is placed in an intraperitoneal location (unusual in renal transplantation alone where the transplant is in the false pelvis). Investigations serum creatinine (2 a serum creatinine of 80μmol/L (0. 9mg/dL) may indicate of renal impairment in pregnancy). FBC, UE, LFTs, calcium, clotting, urate, haemolysis screen, GS, infection screen (MSU, Blood cultures, vaginal swabs, as appropriate). Management Similar to non-pregnant patients. Careful assessment of fl uid status, with correction of volume depletion. Treat underlying cause. acute kidney injury DURING PREGNANCY 845 Septic abortion Sudden onset (over hours) after attempted abortion. Fever (often 40 C), rigors, myalgia, Vomiting, and diarrhoea (may be bloody).",

Pregnancy d ADAMTS13 levels (as does HELLP) but they will be much lower in TTP and many cases of HUS (although usually not available to assist immediate management). Relapse may occur in subsequent pregnancies. 846 CHAPTER 11 Pregnancy and the Kidney Hypertension during pregnancy Introduction Blood Hypertension falls in the early stages of a normal pregnancy and returns to pre-pregnancy baseline by term. Hypertension is the most common medical problem encountered during pregnancy, affecting 7 5 10% of women. Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy carry risks for the mother and are among the leading causes of maternal death in the developed world. Hypertensive disorders also carry a risk for the fetus in terms of higher perinatal mortality rates, preterm birth, and Low birthweight. Defi nition (NICE) Diastolic Blood Hypertension (DBP) of 90mmHg on two separate occasions, more than 4 hours apart, and/or a single DBP reading of 110mmHg. Degrees of hypertension Mild: DBP 90 99mmHg, SBP 140 149mmHg. Moderate: DBP 100 109mmHg, SBP 150 159mmHg. Severe: DBP ≥ 110mmHg, SBP ≥ 160mmHg. Causes Pre-existing essential hypertension ( chronic hypertension ) ( b p. 847). Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) ( gestational hypertension ) ( b p. 847). Pre-eclampsia ( b p. 850). Hypertension complicating renal disease (either pre-existing or developing during pregnancy) ( b p. 856) or other causes of secondary i blood pressure (e. g. hyperaldosteronism or phaeochromocytoma).",

    "text": "Measuring Blood Hypertension in pregnant women Use a well-maintained mercury/aneroid sphygmomanometer or validated automated device. Use the stethoscope bell for auscultation. 2 Always use the correct-sized cuff. Measure with patient sitting after a period of rest, with the arm supported at Heart level. Either arm, but use higher value if 10mmHg difference. Record SBP when sounds are fi rst heard (Korotkoff 1) and DBP at the point of disappearance of sounds ( Korotkoff 5). If the DBP is persistently below 40mmHg, use Korotkoff 4 (and make a note). HYPERTENSION DURING PREGNANCY 847 Pre-existing essential hypertension (chronic hypertension) Presents prior to conception or before 20 weeks gestation (as blood pressure tends to fall in the 1st and 2nd trimesters, a woman with i blood pressure before 20 weeks can be assumed to have pre-existing hypertension). X Treatment targets for hypertensive women without pre-eclampsia remain controversial. Although treatment is likely to have maternal benefi ts, this must be balanced against potential harm to the fetus (particularly IUGR). Goals: For uncomplicated i blood pressure, aim 150/100mmHg (but DBP no less than 80mmHg). If evidence of target organ damage (e. g. renal disease), aim 140/90mmHg. Encourage to lower dietary salt intake. Ensure antihypertensives are altered appropriately, ideally, several months prior to conception (and that blood pressure then stabilizes) or as soon as possible once pregnancy occurs ( b p. 849). Treatment should be based on existing therapy, potential side effect profi les, and discussion with the patient. Seek specialist advice if known or suspected secondary i blood pressure. The majority of pregnancies are uncomplicated, although outcomes are worse than for pregnancy in normotensive patients. There is: An increased incidence of placental abruption, acute kidney injury, cardiac events, and stroke in the mother. Increased risk of growth retardation and unexplained mid-trimester fetal death. A pre-eclampsia risk of 7 20%. Warn about symptoms ( b p. 852). These risks correlate with maternal age, duration and degree of i blood pressure, obesity, and presence of end-organ damage. Recommend aspirin 75mg od from 12 weeks gestation onwards to reduce pre-eclampsia risk. Calcium supplementation may have a small role in preventing serious adverse events, such as fetal death, associated with pre-eclampsia in populations with a Low calcium intake (600mg/day). If proteinuria develops after 20 weeks gestation, treat as for pre-eclampsia. Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) (gestational hypertension) Occurs after 20 weeks gestation. Not associated with proteinuria. Usually no pre-existing diagnosis of i blood pressure. Risk factors include fi rst pregnancy and maternal age 40 years. blood pressure returns to normal post-partum (within 3 months). Increased risk of progression to pre-eclampsia (15 25%) the earlier the development of PIH, the greater the risk. Warn the mother about potential symptoms ( b p. 852). 848 CHAPTER 11 Pregnancy and the Kidney Aspirin 75mg until delivery in those with one High risk factor or two moderate risk factors for pre-eclampsia. High risk: hypertensive disease during a previous pregnancy, chronic kidney disease, Diabetes, thrombophilia, or relevant autoimmune disease (such as SLE or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome). Moderate risk: fi rst pregnancy, age 40 years, pregnancy interval of 10 years, body mass index 35, ve family history, twin or multiple pregnancy). Calcium supplements may be benefi cial in certain groups (b p. 852). Increased risk of both PIH (16 47%) and pre-eclampsia (2 7%) in subsequent pregnancies. Although the cause of gestational hypertension is unclear, it appears to identify women at risk of essential i blood pressure later in life. Management blood pressure lowering is not an end in itself maternal and fetal well-being are also important indicators of the underlying condition.",

Guidelines The NICE guidelines for hypertension in pregnancy are a very useful resource. They are available at M www. nice. org. uk HYPERTENSION DURING PREGNANCY 849 Drug treatment of hypertension in pregnancy 1 No drug is entirely safe in pregnancy. However, experience has allowed an inference of Low fetal risk for many agents (see Table 11. 2). 1 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (and ARBs) are contraindicated during pregnancy: 1st trimester use is associated with an increased risk of cardiac and CNS malformations, and 2nd trimester use is associated with fetal death, oligohydramnios, growth restriction, and renal agenesis. 1 Diuretics should be avoided in pregnancy, as hypovolaemia may compromise placental Blood fl ow. Occasionally, severe oedema, e. g. in the context of nephrotic syndrome, necessitates their use, but this should under close specialist supervision. Breastfeeding Antihypertensive agents safe for breastfeeding in the post-natal period include enalapril, captopril, labetalol, nifedipine, atenolol, and metoprolol. 1 There is insuffi cient evidence to recommend other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ARBs, or amlodipine.

It affects 3 5% of pregnant women and is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The only cure is delivery, hence an association with prematurity. It is also associated with fetal growth restriction and oligohydramnios. Maternal complications include pulmonary oedema, cerebral haemorrhage, hepatic failure, acute kidney injury, and death.

    "text": "Seizures (2% of cases) herald the development of eclampsia. Pathogenesis The placenta plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia and the related conditions of PIH, acute fatty Liver of pregnancy, HELLP syndrome, and pregnancy-induced HUS/TTP. All are associated with inadequate placental cytotrophoblast invasion and widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction (see Fig. 11. 1). Pre-eclampsia and the placenta During normal placental development, cytotrophoblasts of fetal origin invade the uterine spiral arteries and remodel them from small, High-resistance vessels into larger, more dilated vessels able to provide an adequate Blood supply to the developing fetus. In pre-eclampsia, this remodelling is defective, with dysregulation of several angiogenic factors, including soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) (itself a receptor for placental growth factor (PlGF) and VEGF) and endoglin (sEng) (which impairs binding of TGF-1 to endothelial receptors and leads to d endothelial NO-dependent vasodilatation). High concentrations of sFlt-1 are present in in the Blood of women with pre-eclampsia, and the administration of sFlt-1 to animals produces a similar syndrome. Several studies of the utility of biomarkers, including sFlt-1, sEng, and PlGF, for the prediction and early diagnosis of pre-eclampsia are in progress. Low placental L-arginine activity also reduces NO activity, thereby stimulating endothelial NO synthase to generate reactive oxygen species (e. g. peroxynitrite and OH radical) and worsen oxidative stress. Subsequent release of vasopressive factors from the diseased placenta affects maternal endothelium, with increased sensitivity to vasopressors, such as angiotensin II and noradrenaline. This results in the widespread vasoconstriction, hypoperfusion, ischaemia, and vascular dysfunction, characteristic of the clinical syndrome. Abnormalities of renal artery stenosis, infl ammation, immune maladaptation, and genetic susceptibility also appear to play a role.

Seek specialist help. Near term, induction of labour is usually the therapy of choice, whereas a trial of stabilizing, or expectant, treatment may be more appropriate if the pregnancy is at an earlier stage.

Symptoms 2 An explanation of the potential symptoms of pre-eclampsia should be given to all women at risk. Advise them to seek immediate medical attention if they develop: Severe headaches. Visual disturbances (e. g. blurred vision, fl ashing lights, double vision, fl oating spots). New epigastric Pain (or Pain in the right upper quadrant). Vomiting. Breathlessness. Sudden Edema of the hands, feet, or face (1 although oedema is a feature of pre-eclampsia, it also occurs in 60% of normal pregnancies). PRE-ECLAMPSIA: MANAGEMENT 853 Management 3 Admit to hospital, and undertake fetal monitoring. blood pressure reduction is not the sole endpoint of management a dditional assessments of maternal and fetal well-being are equally important. Fetal assessment USS for fetal growth, amniotic fl uid volume assessment, and umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry. Fetal cardiotocography should be performed if there is any change in maternal condition (e. g. decrease in fetal movements, vaginal bleeding, or abdominal Pain). Mild hypertension (blood pressure 140/90 149/99mmHg): Do not treat i blood pressure. Measure blood pressure at least 4 x /day. serum creatinine, UE, LFTs, and FBC x 2/week. Moderate hypertension (blood pressure 150/100 159/109mmHg): Treat to keep blood pressure 150/80 100mmHg (fi rst-line agent: labetalol, b p. 849). Measure blood pressure at least 4x/day. serum creatinine, UE, LFTs, and FBC x 2/week. Severe hypertension (blood pressure ≥ 160/110mmHg): Consider admission to High dependency environment. Treat to keep blood pressure 150/80 100mmHg (fi rst-line agent: labetalol). Measure blood pressure at least 4 x per day. serum creatinine, UE, LFTs, and FBC at least x 3/week. Delivery Before 34 weeks: the decision to deliver can be very diffi cult. The rationale for delay is to improve neonatal outcome through delivery of a more mature fetus. It also affords the opportunity to administer corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturity. However, it risks worsening organ damage in the mother. Delivery is generally recommended if any of the indications shown in Table 11. 3 are present.",

After 34 weeks: delivery is generally recommended once blood pressure has been controlled and a course of corticosteroids administered, depending on maternal and fetal condition. After 37 weeks, delivery within 24 48h is advocated. The choice between Cesarean or vaginal birth will need to be determined in each individual case.

Mild to moderate i blood pressure with one of: severe headache, visual disturbance, Vomiting, epigastric or hypochondrial Pain, Liver tenderness, papilloedema, clonus, HELLP, platelet count 100 x 109 /L, abnormal LFTs. 2 Transfer to critical care if: eclampsia, HELLP, haemorrhage, acute kidney injury, electrolyte disturbances, coagulopathy, unstable or refractory i blood pressure (including need for parenteral therapy), cardiac failure, or abnormal neurology. Continuous blood pressure monitoring. Consider invasive monitoring. Careful fl uid management: Chart input/output. Catheterize, and monitor UO. Limit maintenance fl uids to 80mL/h, unless there are ongoing fl uid losses (e. g. bleeding). Avoid volume expansion, unless hydralazine is used as antihypertensive therapy (b see below). blood pressure management 2 Consult local guidelines. Aim to keep blood pressure 150/80 100mmHg. Monitor maternal and fetal response, in addition to blood pressure response. Continue antenatal antihypertensive therapy. If parenteral therapy is required: Labetalol 20mg IV ( 1 contraindications: asthma, Heart block); double the dose at 10min intervals to maximum cumulative dose of 200mg (or continuous infusion of 1 2mg/min). If inadequate response, give hydralazine 5mg IV, repeated every 15min, to a maximum cumulative dose of 20mg (or continuous infusion 0. 5 10mg/h). Consider administration of 500mL crystalloid before, or at the same time as, the fi rst dose of hydralazine. Anticonvulsants Give IV magnesium sulfate (superior to phenytoin and benzodiazepines) if a mother with severe i blood pressure or severe pre-eclampsia has a seizure (or has previously had an eclamptic seizure). Consider magnesium sulfate if delivery is planned within 24h in those with severe pre-eclampsia. Regimen: Loading dose of 4g IV over 5min. Further dose of 2 4g over 5min if recurrent seizures. Follow with an infusion of 1g/h for 24h. Monitor UO, respiratory rate, O saturation, and refl exes.

    "text": "Prognosis Women with pre-eclampsia have: An increased risk of gestational hypertension in future pregnancies (13 53%). An increased risk of pre-eclampsia in future pregnancies (16 25%) ( 1 50% if pre-eclampsia led to delivery before 28 weeks). An increased risk of developing i blood pressure and CV disease in later life. An increased relative risk of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease (even if normotensive with no proteinuria at post-natal review), although this risk is Low. HELLP syndrome Refers to a syndrome of haemolysis, elevated Liver enzymes, and Low platelet count. Occurs in 0. 1 0. 2% pregnancies. Probably represents a severe form of pre-eclampsia. 15 20% of patients do not have i blood pressure or proteinuria. Often presents with nausea, Vomiting, abdominal Pain, and malaise. About 70% of cases develop prior to delivery (usually 27 37 weeks) and most of the remainder within 48 hours of delivery. The Martin/Mississippi classifi cation grades severity as class I (most severe) to III, based on nadir platelet count, LDH, and Liver function. This helps estimate the maternal morbidity risk (intracerebral haemorrhage is the principal cause of death). Management is similar to pre-eclampsia. X In addition, corticosteroids (dexamethasone, betamethasone, or prednisolone) are commonly used to increase platelet counts, although it remains unclear if this strategy improves overall outcomes. 856 CHAPTER 11 Pregnancy and the Kidney Pre-existing renal disease Introduction The ability to conceive falls with d glomerular filtration rate. 2 However, once pregnant, the key determinant of pregnancy outcome in women with pre-existing renal disease is the degree of renal impairment. Other factors that infl uence outcome include: Hypertension. Degree of proteinuria. Type of renal disease. Obstetric complications include miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery, and Low birthweight. Pregnancy can also result in a deterioration in renal function (see Table 11. 4). This may be permanent and associated with progression to end-stage Kidney disease. 1 Even with normal renal function, normal blood pressure, and non-signifi cant proteinuria, women with a history of renal disease have an increased risk of pre-eclampsia ( 7 10%, compared to a background rate of 3 5% in the general population). General rules The following are helpful to remember when counselling women with renal disease that: Pre-pregnancy serum creatinine 200μmol/L: (2. 25mg/dL) although there is an increased risk of complications (see Table 11. 4), the chances of a successful outcome and healthy baby are relatively Good. Pre-pregnancy serum creatinine 250μmol/L: (2. 8mg/dL) High risk of a poor fetal outcome (including prematurity and signifi cant developmental problems), together with a High risk of developing end-stage renal disease during (or soon after) pregnancy. The presence and degree of maternal i blood pressure and proteinuria are also important considerations.

It is essential that women with Diabetes are educated about the importance of Good pre-conception diabetic control for reducing the risk of congenital malformation (aim hemoglobin hemoglobin A1c ≤6. 1% (43mmol/mol)).

    "text": "4. Refl ux nephropathy Women with refl ux nephropathy should be screened for UTI during pregnancy, and, if present, infection should be treated promptly. Acute pyelonephritis is more common. Mothers should also be counselled regarding the potential risk of inheritance (7 25 30%) and offered post-natal screening for their children ( b p. 712). Autosomal dominant polycystic Kidney disease (autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease) Cyst complications in pregnancy, such as haemorrhage or infection, may masquerade as obstetric complications. Patients with a family history of intracranial aneurysms should ideally be screened for aneurysms themselves prior to pregnancy. Primary glomerular disease The exact type of glomerular disease does not impact on pregnancy outcome, but renal impairment, proteinuria, and maternal i blood pressure all can. Relapse of a stable pre-existing glomerular lesion is generally unlikely (and usually very diffi cult to differentiate from pre-eclampsia when it occurs) ( b p. 859). Wait until disease is in remission (ideally 6 months) before trying to conceive. The form of treatment is also a consideration. If relevant, wait until off cytotoxic agents and on lowest possible effective doses of corticosteroids. For other immunosuppressant drugs, see b p. 866. Proteinuria is likely to double during pregnancy. If 3g/24h (protein-creatinine ratio 300mg/ mmol), then anticoagulation with Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) should be recommended, as there is an increased thrombotic risk. In addition, signifi cant proteinuria (3g/day) is associated with 7 x 2 increased risk of perinatal loss and preterm delivery, compared to no proteinuria. Lupus nephritis Renal impairment, proteinuria, and maternal i blood pressure can all impact on pregnancy outcome. The risk of a disease fl are increases in pregnancy (30%). Active lupus is associated with increased fetal loss, prematurity, and IUGR. In addition, there is a risk of a transient rash and fetal Heart block (requiring pacing) in babies born to anti-Ro positive mothers. Those with antiphospholipid antibodies are at increased risk of spontaneous abortion and should be considered for LMWH from conception. 858 CHAPTER 11 Pregnancy and the Kidney Management of renal disease in pregnancy Requires a multidisciplinary approach, including an obstetrician, a nephrologist, and, ideally, an obstetric physician. Pre-pregnancy counselling (including genetic counselling, if relevant) is extremely important. Folic acid 400 micrograms od 3 months before trying to conceive. Alter medications, including antihypertensives, to drugs that are safe in pregnancy ( b p. 849). Recommend aspirin 75mg, particularly from 12 weeks onwards, to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia. Patients should be booked early to antenatal clinic. Aim to see every 2 3 weeks until 28th week, thereafter weekly. blood pressure every visit. Home blood pressure monitoring may be helpful. Urinalysis every visit (MSU for M, CS in those at particular risk of infection). serum creatinine, UE, Ca2 , LFT, urate, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio every 2 4 weeks. FBC every 4 weeks (IV iron and ESAs are safe). If proteinuria 3g/24h (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 300mg/mmol), then anticoagulation with LMWH should be considered. Monitor disease activity, where possible, e. g. SLE. Serial obstetric scans for those at higher risk (b p. 853). PRE-EXISTING RENAL DISEASE 859 Case study A 27-year-old primigravid Chinese woman presents to antenatal clinic at 18 weeks gestation with progressive oedema. She is found to be normotensive, but urinalysis reveals 3 proteinuria. Her serum creatinine is 54μmol/L (0. 6mg/dL), urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 524mg/mmol, and serum albumin 26g/L. Further investigations included: Low C3 and C4, ve ANA, ve dsDNA, and ve antiphospholipid antibody. Renal USS was normal. After discussion, a renal biopsy was undertaken and revealed class V lupus nephritis (b p. 659).",

Treatment options Lupus nephritis (b p. 658) can be treated with corticosteroids. Azathioprine is also safe in pregnancy, as is tacrolimus (b p. 866). However, MMF ( b p. 866) and cyclophosphamide are contraindicated. Rituximab may also be considered ( X ) but ideally not in the last 6 months of pregnancy so that fetal B cells have time to reconstitute prior to delivery. This patient should also be offered LMWH treatment in view of her proteinuria and antiphospholipid antibody status. If possible, diuretics should be avoided despite her oedema (b p. 849). Learning point If new-onset proteinuria ( 9 renal impairment) occurs in early pregnancy (20 weeks), it is important to attempt to diagnose the underlying renal lesion. Investigation will include immunological and serological testing (b p. 40) and potentially a renal biopsy. A histological diagnosis is likely to assist management in later pregnancy easier, as differentiating primary renal disease from pre-eclampsia becomes very diffi cult (see Table 11. 5).

Haematuria In the absence of proteinuria, haematuria is usually due to anatomical changes (bleeding from small venules in dilated collecting systems). On microscopy, 2 3 red blood cell/hpf is normal in pregnancy (unlike 1 2 in the non-pregnant population). If serum creatinine is normal and no proteinuria, wait until 12 weeks after delivery for further assessment (b p. 66). Obstruction May occur s to mechanical Hypertension exerted by the uterus (usually on the right ureter, often where the ureter crosses the iliac artery) or s to pelvic or ureteric stone impaction. Renal stones Renal stones are uncommon in pregnancy and usually occur in women known to have pre-existing nephrolithiasis. However, collecting system dilatation, coupled with stasis and a 2 3-fold increase in urinary calcium excretion, may precipitate new stone formation in pregnancy. Ureteric stones are more common than stones in the renal pelvis, and most occur after the fi rst trimester. The majority will pass spontaneously, but impacted stones may remain painful, and s urinary infection is a concern. Women with cystinuria should be offered genetic counselling prior to conception, and proactive management of their stone disease should start pre-pregnancy ( b p. 719). 1 The differential diagnosis of stone-induced colic must include obstetric problems, such as placental abruption Investigation Urine dipstick for haematuria and proteinuria. Microscopy: red cells ( morphology), casts, pus cells, and organisms. Urine culture 9 stone analysis. FBC, UE, serum calcium, parathyroid hormone. USS is the fi rst-line imaging modality. Ideally, ionizing radiation should be avoided during the 1st and 2nd trimesters. A limited IVU with fetal shielding is recommended in complex cases. Ureteroscopy may be preferred to computed tomography or multiple irradiations. magnetic resonance imaging has limited utility. Management Hydration and analgesia (7 75% stones will pass spontaneously). Obstruction, intractable Pain, and urosepsis are indications for more defi nitive intervention.

DISORDERS OF THE URINARY TRACT IN PREGNANCY 861 862 CHAPTER 11 Pregnancy and the Kidney Pregnancy on Dialysis Introduction 5 with end-stage renal disease rarely fall pregnant on Dialysis: only 0. 3 2. 2% will conceive (reasons are complex, including hyperprolactinaemia, anaemia, polypharmacy, psychosocial issues, and the uraemic state per se). Nevertheless, contraception should be discussed with women who menstruate on dialysis ( 7 40%). This is particularly true in the fi rst few years after commencing Dialysis. B -HCG levels are High in Dialysis patients, so if the level is High and pregnancy is a possibility, an USS should be performed. If a pregnancy occurs and progresses beyond the 1st trimester, fetal outcomes have previously been poor and associated with signifi cant maternal morbidity. However, better maternal and fetal care, coupled with improvements in Dialysis effi ciency and increases in Dialysis frequency, have led to more optimism around pregnancy on Dialysis. In general, however, transplantation, if feasible, remains the favoured means for a patient with end-stage renal disease to conceive and undertake a pregnancy ( b p. 864). What Dialysis patients of childbearing age should know 13 45% of pregnancies result in spontaneous miscarriage before 20 weeks gestation. The outcomes of pregnancy on Dialysis are improving. Available data suggest 23% of pregnancies resulted in a live infant in 1980, whilst this is now in excess of 70%. Maternal morbidity (e. g. hospitalization) remains signifi cant, but mortality is rare. Maternal hypertension is very common. Preterm birth (70 100%, mean gestational age 32 weeks) and Low birthweight (virtually 100%) are extremely common. Long-term outcomes for these infants are not yet known. Prolonged admissions to neonatal intensive care are common. Congenital abnormalities occur with the same frequency as in the general population. Pregnancy on Dialysis is physically and emotionally demanding. Patients should be encouraged to dialyse as much as possible, preferably daily for long hours. It is worth re-exploring options for transplantation. Dialysis prescription There is no overriding reason for a modality switch: hemodialysis delivers a higher Dialysis dose, but continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (esp. APD) offers less rapid metabolic changes and allows steady fl uid removal whilst avoiding intradialytic hypotension. Residual renal function is important, as it improves pregnancy outcomes. PREGNANCY ON Dialysis 863 Haemodialysis Aim for urea consistently ≤ 15mmol/L (40mg/dL) through daily Dialysis for at least 20h/week) (7 6 treatments). Titrate dialysate potassium , Ca2 , and HCO against serum levels (may require reduction in dialysate HCO to pre 3 vent maternal alkalaemia). Heparin requirements may increase. 13 Avoid hypotension. Allow for additional 0. 5kg/week weight gains from mid-pregnancy onwards. Peritoneal Dialysis As pregnancy progresses and intra-abdominal peritoneal dialysis fl uid volume is less well-tolerated and automated peritoneal dialysis, with more frequent lower volume exchanges, is preferable. peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis should be treated promptly and assiduously, bearing in mind the potential teratogenicity of many antibiotics. Diet, calcium, and vitamin D Involve your dietetic staff from the outset. i Protein intake to 1. 2 1. 4g/ kg pre-pregnant weight 10g per day. For continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, take dialysate Protein losses into account and replace. Offer a daily multivitamin preparation, containing Water-soluble vitamins. Increase folate to 1. 6mg/day. The placenta produces calcitriol, so vitamin D analogue doses may require adjustment. Supplemental potassium may be necessary. Anaemia Erythropoietin is not teratogenic. Dose requirements will increase by 50 100% in pregnancy. IV iron is safe and effective. Labour and delivery Most units will deliver pregnant Dialysis patients early (usually prompted by worsening i blood pressure, IUGR, or both). Pregnancies rarely progress beyond 38 weeks.",

Temporary hemodialysis may be necessary for a period in cases of peritoneal dialysis fl uid leakage. Assess fl uid status carefully: 1 avoid volume overload. Beware infection. Neonates will need specialist input, including regular electrolyte assessment. 864 CHAPTER 11 Pregnancy and the Kidney Pregnancy after renal transplantation: introduction Improvement in renal function following successful transplantation, usually restores menstruation and fertility. Post-transplantation, 12% of women of childbearing age will become pregnant. Advice regarding contraception should 6 be accessible (key points: avoid oestrogen-containing contraceptives, as they can i blood pressure and they also have an unpredictable effect on CNI metabolism. Progesterone-only preparations and IUCDs are safe and more effective than barrier methods). All renal transplant recipients contemplating pregnancy should be offered appropriate pre-pregnancy counselling (this may include genetic counselling, depending on underlying renal disease). Outcomes A number of international registries have recorded the outcomes of pregnancy in renal transplant patients around the world. A recent meta-analysis of available data from 4, 706 pregnancies in 3, 570 transplant recipients reported a live birth and miscarriage rate of 73% and 14%, respectively. Both these fi gures are similar to those seen in the general population. In 5 with Good graft function, 95% pregnancies that progress beyond 12 weeks are likely to have a successful outcome. Complications The key renal factors that affect the incidence of complications are: serum creatinine pre-conception. i blood pressure. Degree of proteinuria. Important complications (the incidence range refl ects the presence and severity of the above factors) include: i blood pressure (30 60%): 7 50% of 5 transplant recipients are taking antihypertensive drugs. i blood pressure is associated with premature birth and pre-eclampsia. For safe antihypertensive medications, see b p. 849. Pre-eclampsia (22 45%). IUGR (20 40%). Preterm delivery (20 60%), with associated Low birthweight. Gestational Diabetes ( 7 8%). There is also an increased incidence of UTI (7 40%) (and graft pyelonephritis) during pregnancy. Cesarean section rates are increased, refl ecting the complex nature of the pregnancies, rather than presence of the transplant itself (which lies in the false pelvis).

For those with poor function (serum creatinine 160μmol/L (1. 8mg/dL)), renal function post-pregnancy is likely to be worse than pre-, and there is a signifi cant incidence of premature graft loss. Rejection The risk of allograft rejection does not appear to be increased during pregnancy, with a reported rate of 7 4%. However, when it occurs, it is associated with poorer outcomes. Risk factors: shorter interval between transplantation and pregnancy, Low CNI levels. 1 Pregnancy enhances CNI metabolism. Diligent therapeutic monitoring is necessary, often with signifi cant dose increases. The cause of graft dysfunction ( b p. 404) can be diffi cult to diagnose in pregnancy. Transplant biopsies are often required and are safe in expert hands. 866 CHAPTER 11 Pregnancy and the Kidney Pregnancy after renal transplantation: management Transplant drugs during pregnancy In the transplant setting, there is no other choice but to expose the fetus to immunosuppressive agents, as all the relevant drugs pass through to the fetal circulation to some degree. Reassuringly, however, the incidence of major congenital malformations does not appear different from the non-transplant population. 1 There are specifi c concerns regarding the use of MMF in pregnancy, and there are too little data on sirolimus to currently recommend its use (see Table 11. 7). Table 11. 7 Safety of common immune suppressant agents in pregnancy Immunosuppression Safe Unsafe Ciclosporin Mycophenolate Tacrolimus Sirolimus (limited data) Azathioprine Corticosteroids Mycophenolate has been shown to cause a specifi c pattern of malformation in 20 25% of cases (hypoplastic nails, shortened fi fth fi nger, ear defects, including deafness and cleft palate). Neonates should be monitored for adrenal suppression. 1 Pregnancy enhances the metabolism of CNIs. Careful therapeutic monitoring is essential, and signifi cant dose adjustments are often required. X Breastfeeding is not generally advocated on maintenance immunosuppression, but many authorities do not believe it is absolutely contraindicated. 3 Also unsafe in pregnancy: valganciclovir, co-trimoxazole, statins, fl uconazole, and other -azole antifungal drugs.

At a visit to transplant clinic, she expresses her desire to try for pregnancy. She has had one episode of cellular rejection (Banff category 2A) 3 months previously, treated with pulsed corticosteroids.

What advice would you give her about pregnancy, and what changes to her medications would you suggest? Recommendations Offer appropriate detailed counselling and planning, ideally in a multidisciplinary obstetric-renal clinic. Wait for 1 year post-transplantation (some advocate 18 24 months) and, preferably, 6 months after an episode of rejection. Ensure stable graft function, and document degree of any proteinuria. Immune suppression: needs to be stable. This patient should be changed to azathioprine under careful supervision and monitored for 3 months. Stop angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (monitor blood pressure, and consider safe alternative), statin, and bisphosphonate. Start folic acid at least 3 months prior to conception to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. Consider aspirin 75mg od once pregnant (particularly after 12 weeks) to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia. Assess thromboembolic risk (particularly if proteinuria).

Ask yourself, Is the drug still warranted, given the potential increased risk? . Principles The kidneys have a fundamental role in the elimination of drugs, even those partially metabolized in the Liver. Renal elimination may be either by glomerular fi ltration or tubular secretion. Renal impairment may necessitate a dose reduction, an extension in the dosing interval, or a combination of both. Such alterations will depend on the degree of renal dysfunction (or form of renal replacement therapy). Impaired renal function is common in elderly patients and those with multiple comorbidities, so the potential effects of polypharmacy and drug interactions are particularly relevant in these groups. Individuals who have been taking a drug at the same dose over a long period may need a dose alteration, as renal function changes with time. In practice, particular care is needed when using those drugs where: There is a narrow therapeutic index, i. e. the toxic and therapeutic ranges overlap or are close to each other (e. g. digoxin, aciclovir). Renal toxicity is a potential effect of the drug. (cid: 2) Beware the vicious cycle of worsening renal function, decreasing drug clearance, and rising drug levels (e. g. aminoglycosides). (cid: 2) The consequences of accumulation are serious (e. g. metformin, opiates). The monitoring of therapeutic drug levels may be helpful in these situations. If there is a relatively wide therapeutic window, it may be possible to use a drug safely with a simple dose reduction (e. g. half the standard dose ). This is the case with many antibiotics. (cid: 2) However, never estimate always confi rm the appropriate dosing schedule. Pharmacodynamics Renal impairment may alter the sensitivity of target tissue to the effects of drugs.",

Pharmacokinetics Renal impairment infl uences the pharmacokinetics of most drugs to some degree. Understanding why can help select drugs, doses, and dosing intervals that achieve therapeutic plasma concentrations but avoiding toxicity. Absorption.

Protein binding: Changes in albumin concentration will affect the free (and 6 active) concentration of highly Protein-bound drugs. Nephrotic syndrome l hypoalbuminaemia l d albumin binding li free drug. Competitive binding of acidic uraemic toxins to albumin will also increase free drug. Example: phenytoin is less Protein-bound in renal failure, and signs of toxicity may occur at therapeutic levels. ( (cid: 2) Many assays used for therapeutic monitoring will not refl ect this, as they measure total drug. ) Warfarin and diazepam may also be affected. 2 Be cautious with dose adjustments. Altered body composition: Impaired renal function is associated with signifi cant changes in body Water, muscle, and adipose tissue. Fluid overload will increase V for Protein-bound and Water-soluble d drugs (e. g. atenolol, vancomycin). Reduced muscle and adipose tissue may affect V for hydrophilic d drugs (e. g. statins, morphine, codeine). Altered drug tissue binding: Uraemia reduces tissue binding. Digoxin is the most clinically relevant, with a signifi cant reduction in V. d Metabolism. Two important examples of the Kidney s involvement in drug metabolism are: (i) activation of vitamin D compounds through 1 A -hydroxylation; (ii) metabolism of insulin (cid: 2) insulin requirements often decrease signifi cantly as renal failure progresses. 872 CHAPTER 12 Drugs and the Kidney Clearance Clearance depends on glomerular fi ltration, tubular secretion, and tubular reabsorption.

Smaller molecules (MW 60, 000) are fi ltered at the glomerulus unless Protein-bound. Water-soluble (polar) molecules are more freely fi ltered than lipid-soluble (non-polar) ones. Tubular secretion. Non-polar drugs diffuse more readily across tubular membranes. In addition, many polar drugs undergo active excretion by the same mechanisms as organic acids and bases. Organic acids: penicillins, cephalosporins, salicylates, loop and thiazide diuretics. Organic bases: amiloride, quinidine, procainamide. Acidic drugs are more effectively secreted into alkaline Urine and vice versa. This can be exploited therapeutically, e. g. urinary alkalinization in salicylate poisoning. Tubular reabsorption of non-polar drugs may be signifi cant. First-order kinetics Most drugs excreted by the kidneys exhibit fi rst-order kinetics, i. e. the rate of elimination is proportional to the concentration of the drug. Drugs that demonstrate such kinetics can be described by their half-life (t ). This is the time taken for the drug concentration to halve after 1/2 absorption and distribution. t determines steady state concentration, appropriate dosing interval, 1/2 and persistence after cessation of treatment.

If in any doubt, discuss with a renal pharmacist they are an invaluable resource on all specialist units. PRESCRIBING IN RENAL IMPAIRMENT 875 876 CHAPTER 12 Drugs and the Kidney Prescribing for Dialysis patients Patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) will normally have an insignifi cant native glomerular filtration rate, and the removal of drugs usually dependent on renal excretion will 6 be negligible. 2 It is vital to know whether such drugs will be removed by Dialysis. Drug clearance will vary, according to modality of Dialysis. Clearance by haemodialysis and peritoneal Dialysis is contingent on diffusion down a concentration gradient between plasma and dialysate. Clearance during haemofi ltration is reliant on convection alone. Two important factors that may infl uence drug removal require consideration when prescribing for patients on RRT: Characteristics of the drug. Characteristics of the type of RRT. Drug characteristics Molecular weight (MW): Haemodialysis membranes have relatively small pore sizes and will only clear molecules 500Da. Haemofi lters have larger pore sizes and can clear much larger molecules 5, 000Da. Protein binding: Heavily Protein-bound drugs are not well removed (even if Low MW). Volume of distribution: Large volumes of distribution result in Low plasma drug concentrations and reduced availability for removal by Dialysis. Water solubility: Water-soluble drugs pass through fi lters more readily than lipid-soluble ones. For patients receiving RRT, glomerular filtration rate cannot be calculated using standard equations. Even though clearance may be higher during treatment, dosing at creatinine clearance 10mL/min is common for haemodialysis, as the treatment is generally intermittent. Clearance is higher in continuous techniques, such as continuous veno-venous haemofi ltration (CVVHF) or continuous veno-venous haemodiafi ltration (CVVHDF) where clearances can be in the range 30 40mL/min. This allows larger doses to be prescribed. Generally, the manufacturer of machines and dialysers/fi lters will provide an estimate of creatinine clearance by their system. Drugs will have a sieving coeffi cient that indicates the proportion of drug that will pass through a membrane during treatment. A drug that passes freely has a sieving coeffi cient of 1, and one does not pass at all will have a coeffi cient of 0. It is the knowledge of the system clearance and the drug-sieving coeffi cient that informs guidance for drug prescription. PRESCRIBING FOR Dialysis PATIENTS 877 There are several comprehensive resources, such as renal formularies, that could, and should, be frequently consulted. Clinical decision support alerts within electronic prescribing systems can help reduce errors. Specialist renal and critical care pharmacists are an invaluable source of information and essential members of the relevant clinical teams. RRT characteristics Properties of the dialyser or fi lter (pore size, surface area). Drug adsorption onto some membrane types. Duration of therapy, e. g. haemodialysis provides effi cient clearance but is only an intermittent treatment. Peritoneal Dialysis clears drugs much less effi ciently than either haemodialysis or haemofi ltration but is a continuous technique. Dialysate and Blood fl ow rates (determine concentration gradient). For peritoneal Dialysis: Peritoneal membrane status, e. g. clearance increases during the infl ammation caused by peritonitis. Volume and frequency of exchanges. Drugs that are cleared by haemodialysis are usually administered after a treatment session. 878 CHAPTER 12 Drugs and the Kidney Sepsis and antimicrobials 3 Sepsis is a relatively common cause and complication of renal failure.

However, prompt empirical treatment to cover all likely pathogens may be necessary in deteriorating patients. 2 Local antibiotic policies, developed with microbiology and pharmacy input, should be adhered to in all, but exceptional, circumstances. Prudent antibiotic prescribing can reduce hospital-related infections, such as MRSA and C. diffi cile, and help to prevent antibiotic resistance. Always record indication and intended antibiotic duration or review date. IV antibiotics should be switched to oral equivalents after 48h if T 38 C for 48h, patient is clinically improving, a suitable oral agent is available, and there is no evidence of malabsorption, gastric stasis, or Vomiting. There are exceptions (e. g. peritoneal dialysis peritonitis, endocarditis, meningitis) your microbiology team will advise. Numerous antimicrobials depend on renal clearance. However, most have a wide therapeutic index, and dose reductions are only necessary once glomerular filtration rate is 20mL/min ( (cid: 2) aminoglycosides and vancomycin are important exceptions). High doses of B -lactam antibiotics can accumulate and cause neurological sequelae, including confusion, agitation, and seizures in advanced chronic kidney disease, including Dialysis patients. Cephalosporins and quinolones require dose reductions in more severe renal impairment (see Table 12. 2).

Aminoglycosides can be used with care ( b p. 880). Haemodialysis patients Central vascular Dialysis catheter infection or PTFE access graft sepsis should always be considered (b p. 297). Even if a PTFE graft has previously been surgically removed, residual material may remain i n situ. 2 Always consider immediate removal of any foreign body (particularly Dialysis lines). Do not wait for culture results. Empirical therapy often involves vancomycin and gentamicin, which are dosed according to trough drug levels ( b p. 882). Unlike gentamicin ( b p. 881), vancomycin SEPSIS AND ANTIMICROBIALS 879 is not effectively removed by standard hemodialysis, so speed of clearance will largely depend on residual renal function (if any). In practice, doses may be days apart. (cid: 2) Beware the complacency this can induce i t is crucial to proactively measure and respond to drug levels if periods of inadequate antibiotic activity are to be avoided. In addition to aminoglycosides, penicillins (e. g. benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, and co-amoxiclav), meropenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofl oxacin, metronidazole, clarithromycin, and trimethoprim are removed by hemodialysis and should be given post-treatment. 3 Severe sepsis is an exception administer immediately. Peritoneal Dialysis patients (b p. 322) In suspected peritoneal dialysis peritonitis, perform an exchange, and send fl uid for M, CS. Peritonitis in overnight APD patients may be less easily diagnosed, as the patient may not witness a cloudy bag. Also consider (and examine for) exit site or tunnel infections related to Tenckhoff catheters. (cid: 2) Remember: other causes of peritonitis or an acute abdomen can, and do, occur in peritoneal Dialysis patients. All renal units will have a detailed antibiotic policy for the treatment of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis and exit site infections. International guidance can be found at M. Post-transplantation ( b p. 426) Patients are susceptible to a wide variety of infectious pathogens at different stages post-transplantation. Atypical infections must always enter the differential. Initial broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment is often necessary until investigations are completed and culture results available. Also review the degree of immunosuppression, and consider a reduction.",

    "text": "Also review the degree of immunosuppression, and consider a reduction. If overwhelming sepsis, stop all immunosuppression, and replace with IV steroid (e. g. hydrocortisone IV 50mg qds) until condition allows phased reintroduction. 2 Discuss with transplant team ASAP. Antivirals Many antivirals, including aciclovir, ganciclovir, valganciclovir, famciclovir, and lamivudine, are dependent on renal clearance and will begin to accumulate, even in relatively mild renal insuffi ciency (glomerular filtration rate 50mL/min). Dose-related (and usually reversible) neurological toxicity is typical ( l dizziness, tremor, confusion, ataxia, hallucinations, drowsiness, encephalopathy, seizures). Bone marrow suppression is also possible. Ribavirin and its metabolites rely on renal clearance, and their accumulation can cause severe anaemia. The neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir undergoes hepatic breakdown to active metabolites, requiring subsequent renal clearance. An increased dose interval is 6 recommended once glomerular filtration rate 30mL/min. Many antivirals are removed freely by Dialysis. Antifungals Unlike many other azole antifungals (e. g. ketoconazole, itraconazole), fl uconazole is renally excreted, so maintenance dosing requires adjustment in moderate to severe chronic kidney disease. It should also be administered after Dialysis. Fluconazole s urinary excretion means that it is useful in the treatment of fungal infections of the urinary tract. 880 CHAPTER 12 Drugs and the Kidney Aminoglycosides (cid: 2) Aminoglycosides must always be used with caution in renal impairment, as they undergo renal clearance, have a narrow therapeutic window, and are nephrotoxic. A vicious cycle of rising drug levels and worsening renal function can (and often does) result. Aminoglycosides are freely fi ltered by the glomerulus (so dose is adjusted according to glomerular filtration rate) and then partially taken up by tubular cells. This can cause tubular cell injury ( l ATN). 2 Several factors increase risk of both nephrotoxicity (and ototoxicity): prolonged treatment, dehydration, concomitant diuretic use, obstructive jaundice, hypokalaemia, and hypomagnesaemia. Dose adjustments aim to achieve peak plasma levels that are bactericidal whilst permitting Low trough levels that avoid toxicity. SEPSIS AND ANTIMICROBIALS 881 (cid: 2) Gentamicin dosing Gentamicin does not enter fat, so obese patients should be dosed, according to ideal body weight (IBW), calculated as follows: Adult : IBW (in kg) 50 (2. 3 x height in inches over 5 feet). Adult : IBW (in kg) 45. 5 (2. 3 x height in inches over 5 feet). 2 Protocols will vary, so consult local policies, and discuss with microbiology. glomerular filtration rate 20mL/min: usual fi rst dose for empirical treatment is 5mg/kg (according to ideal body weight), with a maximum dose of 450mg. glomerular filtration rate 20mL/min in those who are not on Dialysis treatment: usual recommended dose is 3mg/kg, according to ideal body weight, with a maximum of 280mg. Patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis: usual recommended fi rst dose is 2mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 180mg. Seek advice regarding subsequent doses. Serum levels are maintained in the therapeutic range for longer in patients with d glomerular filtration rate, and the dosing interval may be every 2 5 days. A trough serum level, taken 20h post-dose, should be 1mg/L (unless the patient is on hemodialysis) before repeat administration. Peak level measurement is unnecessary in once daily dosing regimens. If the level is not 1mg/L, then repeat every 24h, and redose when 1mg/L (and if there remains a clear indication for the drug). In hemodialysis patients, redose when pre-Dialysis levels are 2mg/L. Dialysis removes a signifi cant proportion of gentamicin waiting for pre-Dialysis trough levels to fall to 1mg/L risks sub-therapeutic periods. Gentamicin is generally administered at the end of hemodialysis and by intraperitoneal administration in peritoneal dialysis patients. Amikacin, netilmicin, and tobramycin have similar pharmacokinetics and require similar management.",

However, most of the large practice-changing cardiology trials have specifi cally excluded patients with renal impairment. This means that the robust evidence base developed for many CV drugs in the general population is not necessarily transferable to individuals with renal disease. X In fact, in certain situations, there may be a risk of more harm than Good. 2 Hypertension in Dialysis patients is often driven by salt and Water overload, with volume expansion. Discuss changes in an antihypertensive regimen with the patient s renal team to avoid hypotensive episodes during Dialysis treatment. Specifi c drug groups Beta-blockers Atenolol is excreted by the kidneys and is removed by hemodialysis (but not peritoneal dialysis). It is still used widely in advanced chronic kidney disease, but the dose is best titrated to avoid the effects of accumulation (e. g. bradycardia). Similarly, metoprolol, bisoprolol, and carvedilol should be titrated cautiously, according to clinical circumstances. The latter three are not removed by Dialysis.",

    "text": "The latter three are not removed by Dialysis. Calcium channel blockers, α -blockers, and nitrates Do not require dose reduction, although caution around the precipitation of postural hypotension should be exercised. Aspirin Is prescribed in standard doses in chronic kidney disease for primary and secondary CV risk modifi cation, although bleeding risk is likely to increase as renal dysfunction progresses. Use with caution when combined with other antiplatelet agents. Consider gastric protection. Clopidogrel Indications, benefi ts, and ideal dose in more advanced chronic kidney disease are unknown. Most clinicians use as for non-renal patients, but caution is required, as the risk of bleeding is likely to be increased. Heparin LMWHs undergo renal clearance and accumulate in advanced chronic kidney disease (particularly glomerular filtration rate 30mL/min). (cid: 2) While the doses used for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism are generally well tolerated, larger treatment doses have been associated with signifi cant, and serious, bleeding complications. Monitoring of activated factor Xa levels has been advocated but may not always be practical. While suggestions for dose modifi cation are available for some LMWHs, unfractionated heparin may be preferred in many situations. 2 It is vital that a local guideline is developed and adhered to. At present, many patients with chronic kidney disease do not receive, or receive inappropriate doses of, anticoagulants in emergency situations, such as acute coronary syndrome even though chronic kidney disease places them in a High-risk group. Unfractionated heparin is usually commenced in standard dosage and adjusted, according to APTT. Fondaparinux is a factor Xa inhibitor that can be used at a reduced dose in mild to moderate renal impairment but is best avoided in more advanced chronic kidney disease (glomerular filtration rate 30mL/min). CARDIOVASCULAR DRUGS 893 Oral anticoagulants Risk/benefi t assessment must be carefully undertaken for many indications (such as prevention of Dialysis access thrombosis or prevention of thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation), particularly as chronic kidney disease progresses. (cid: 2) Individuals with chronic kidney disease often require lower doses of warfarin, have poorer control of anticoagulation, and are at increased risk of bleeding complications. Anticoagulants may 6 need lower dosage at initiation and closer monitoring. The risks (as well as uncertainties regarding benefi t) increase in chronic kidney disease stage 5 and 5D. There is much more experience with warfarin than other oral anticoagulants, such as phenindione. However, there is increasing recognition that warfarin therapy in chronic kidney disease 5D may signifi cantly contribute to ectopic vascular calcifi cation. Experience with the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran is limited in chronic kidney disease. Patients with a creatinine clearance 30mL/min were excluded from the RE-LY study that defi ned its utility in atrial fibrillation. While dose reductions have been suggested, it is best avoided if glomerular filtration rate 30mL/min and certainly if 15mL/min. Its anticoagulant effect is more diffi cult to reverse. It undergoes renal clearance and is also removed by Dialysis (which has been proposed as a potential means of reversal in emergency situations). Thrombolytics No dose reduction recommended, although the potential for bleeding complications rises as chronic kidney disease advances. ACE inhibitors (and ARBs) Widely prescribed in chronic kidney disease ( b p. 203). Clinical trials show a Good safety profi Blood, even in higher chronic kidney disease stages. Check estimated glomerular filtration rate and potassium before and 3 5 days after. Expect (and allow) a rise in serum creatinine or d estimated glomerular filtration rate of up to 20%, but recheck within 2 4 weeks.",

    "text": "(cid: 2) A precipitous fall in glomerular filtration rate may be seen in situations where renal perfusion is dependent on renal artery stenosis activation (l CCF, bilateral renal artery stenosis, stenosis to a solitary Kidney). 2 Rapid d glomerular filtration rate and acute kidney injury are always made more likely by volume depletion (diuretics, GI upset, etc. ). It is sensible to advise patients to temporarily stop these medications in the event of intercurrent illness, particularly if dehydration is a factor. Digoxin Is less tissue-bound in the presence of impaired renal function and 6 has a reduced volume of distribution. Dose reductions are necessary from relatively early chronic kidney disease, and monitoring of levels can guide maintenance treatment. Loading doses are also reduced at end-stage renal disease (e. g. 750 micrograms 1mg in three divided doses). Digoxin is not removed by Dialysis or fi ltration. Digitoxin, an alternative cardiac glycoside, undergoes Liver metabolism and does not require such substantial dose adjustments. Amiodarone Does not require dose modifi cation, but beware multiple drug interactions. Statins Evidence of benefi t for lipid-lowering therapy in chronic kidney disease is limited ( b p. 205), but statins can be used at standard doses. Myopathy is more common, so High doses should be used with caution. There is an important interaction with ciclosporin in transplant recipients (l i myopathy risk). (cid: 2) Fibrates require dose reduction in moderate renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate 40mL/min) and should be avoided in advanced chronic kidney disease. They are also associated with a reversible increase in serum creatinine (thought to be mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor A ). E zetimibe is considered safe for use with no dose modifi cation. 894 CHAPTER 12 Drugs and the Kidney Prescribing in specifi c situations Diabetic chronic kidney disease Close working between renal and diabetic teams is highly desirable. Collaboration can ensure a patient s treatment remains appropriate as chronic kidney disease progresses. Medications must be adjusted for optimal control of glycaemia, reduction of proteinuria, modifi cation of cardiovascular risk, and prevention of chronic kidney disease progression. Diabetic patients may also require intervention for chronic kidney disease-related complications, including anaemia, at a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate, and these can be more symptomatic in the presence of other Diabetes-related comorbidities. Insulin (cid: 2) Metabolized, rather than excreted, by the kidneys. Careful prospective review of an individual s insulin regimen is necessary, as glomerular filtration rate falls, if hypoglycaemia is to be avoided. Educate the patient that insulin requirements may decrease, independent of changes in diet or activity. Insulin also has a role in the management of hyperkalaemia (b p. 130). Insulin is not removed by Dialysis. Metformin 90 100% renal excretion and 6 contraindicated in advanced chronic kidney disease. Consider switching to alternatives (often insulin) once estimated glomerular filtration rate 40mL/ min and certainly once 30mL/min. 2 Accumulation in renal insuffi ciency can rarely cause profound lactic acidosis, particularly during episodes of acute-on-chronic Kidney injury ( (cid: 2) contrast) or during intercurrent illnesses involving hypoxaemia (e. g. sepsis, myocardial infarction). Sulfonylureas Gliclazide and glipizide undergo minimal renal clearance and require no dose adjustment. However, since they increase insulin secretion, which itself may have a prolonged action in chronic kidney disease, they should be titrated with caution. (cid: 2) The metabolites of glibenclamide and glimepiride may accumulate and cause unpredictable hypoglycaemia, so these agents are best avoided. Acarbose Avoid if estimated glomerular filtration rate 25mL/min, as metabolites accumulate. Metglitinides Repaglinide and nateglinide can be used without a dose adjustment. Thiazolidinediones Undergo biliary excretion and do not require dose adjustment.",

    "text": "Thiazolidinediones Undergo biliary excretion and do not require dose adjustment. However, they have been associated with problematic fl uid retention and oedema in patients with NYHA class III or IV Heart failure. Given the incidence of cardiac disease and volume overload in chronic kidney disease, they should be avoided or used with extreme caution. Gliptins predominantly undergo renal excretion (except linagliptin-bile and GI tract). Sitagliptin requires dose reduction; e. g. 50mg daily for glomerular filtration rate 3050mL/min and 25mg for glomerular filtration rate 30ml/min. Sitagliptin is not dialysed and can be used in hemodialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients (generally 25mg daily). Linagliptins route of elimination means that it does not require dose adjustment. There is less experience with other gliptins. Thyroid disease Thyroid hormone Replacement does not require dose adjustment. However, co-administration with phosphate binders or oral iron impairs absorption. T3 and T4 are both highly Protein-bound. In profound PRESCRIBING IN SPECIFIC SITUATIONS 895 hypoalbuminaemia, such as in the nephrotic syndrome, changes in the unbound fraction of T3 and T4 may cause temporary toxicity. In addition, TFTs should be interpreted with caution in advanced chronic kidney disease, as uraemia is associated with d peripheral enzymatic conversion of T4 l T3, as well as d Protein binding. Practically, this means titrating dose changes more slowly against clinical, not just biochemical, response. Hyperuricaemia and gout Fractional excretion of uric acid falls as glomerular filtration rate declines, and this may be aggravated by drugs that reduce urate clearance (e. g. diuretics, ciclosporin, NSAIDs). Gout is, therefore, highly prevalent in chronic kidney disease. Colchicine Accumulates in renal impairment, so lower doses are recommended to avoid GI and haematological side effects. e. g. 500mcg bd. Allopurinol Is metabolized to oxypurinol, an active metabolite that accumulates in renal impairment. This means it should be introduced at lower dosage (e. g. 100mg daily) and titrated. Side effects include cutaneous reactions and bone marrow suppression. (cid: 2) There is an important drug interaction between azathioprine and allopurinol (l profound bone marrow suppression). Concomitant administration should be avoided. There is limited experience with f ebuxostat, a newer xanthine oxidase inhibitor once glomerular filtration rate 30mL/min. Concomitant use with azathioprine should be avoided. NSAIDs Are best avoided, where possible, but may be useful for brief administration under close supervision. C orticosteroids may be helpful in severe or refractory cases, with no dose adjustments. Rasburicase Is an intravenously administered urate oxidase inhibitor that potently reduces uric acid levels in the prophylaxis and treatment of acute hyperuricaemia during chemotherapy. No dose adjustment is required. Bone metabolism Bisphosphonates Are extensively excreted in the Urine. They are assimilated into bone and promote osteoclast apoptosis. The normal bone remodelling cycle (the coupling of osteoclastic resorption with osteoblastic formation) lasts 7 200 days but may exceed 1, 000 days, following bisphosphonate administration. Impaired clearance in renal insuffi ciency increases the amount incorporated in the skeleton where it may cause or exacerbate Low bone turnover and 6 adynamic bone disorder. Safety in chronic kidney disease 4 5 is unproven, and bisphosphonates should be avoided in this context (b p. 234). Rapid administration of IV bisphosphonates (e. g. pamidronate) without adequate hydration has also been associated with acute nephrotoxicity and acute kidney injury. Nausea Dopamine antagonists Such as domperidone, metoclopramide, and pro chlorperazine, are not renally excreted and can be used in renal insuffi ciency. However, extrapyramidal side effects are more common, so titrate doses carefully. Domperidone does not cross the Blood brain barrier and may be preferred. 5-HT3 antagonists Such as ondansetron and granisetron, do not require dose modifi cation.",

Uraemia may affect autonomic and enteric nervous system function. continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis may delay gastric emptying and promote refl ux. In addition, gastric irritants, such as aspirin, are widely prescribed in this population. Antacids Are safe, although aluminium or magnesium can accumulate if taken in excess. Proton pump inhibitors Can be safely prescribed in standard doses. PPIs have been implicated in the development of interstitial nephritis. Although this is a rare side effect, the number of individuals taking them means that they are now the most important cause of acute interstitial nephritis in many countries. H2 receptor antagonists Are renally excreted but generally prescribed safely, with no dose modifi cation. Cimetidine is best avoided: it interacts with cytochrome P450 enzymes, causing drug interactions, and falsely elevates serum creatinine through the inhibition of active urinary Creatinine secretion. Constipation GI motility is affected by renal failure: uraemia disturbs colonic innervation; diet is often suboptimal, and polypharmacy is common. Both hemodialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients should avoid constipation the former because of increased enteric potassium absorption, and the latter as it impairs infl ow and outfl ow of Dialysis and 6 Dialysis effi ciency. Dietary intervention Can be effective. Dose modifi cations of b ulking agents (e. g. ispaghula), s timulating agents (e. g. senna, bisacodyl), and osmotic agents (e. g. lactulose) are generally not required. Bowel cleansing solutions Should be used with caution in advanced chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury due to the potential risk of hypovolaemia as well as their High phosphate or magnesium content. Psychotropic drugs Mostly lipid-soluble and Liver-metabolized. However, caution is prudent, as side effects may be more common in advanced chronic kidney disease. Slow dose titration is advisable. Often non-dialysed. Serotonin-specifi c reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Are widely prescribed at normal doses, with cautious titration (e. g. citalopram, paroxetine, sertraline). Tricyclic antidepressants Are predominantly hepatically metabolized and may be used with careful titration. However, patients with advanced chronic kidney disease may be more prone to anticholinergic side effects, such as postural hypotension. Benzodiazepines Are Liver-metabolized, but heightened CNS toxicity, particularly sedation, is a concern. Short-acting agents are 6 preferred. Protein binding of midazolam is reduced, so it should be used with caution in advanced chronic kidney disease. Antipsychotics Such as clozapine, olanzapine, and quetiapine, are generally well tolerated. Risperidone and its active metabolites are renally excreted, so initiation and titration are cautious. Lithium is discussed on b p. 904. PRESCRIBING IN SPECIFIC SITUATIONS 897 Haloperidol Is often used in acute agitation as well as an antiemetic. Smaller initial doses should be used in advanced chronic kidney disease because of increased CNS sensitivity. Anticonvulsants Carbamazepine Is dosed as normal. However, it is a potent enzyme inducer with multiple interactions, so particular care must be taken post-transplantation. (cid: 2) Gabapentin and pregabalin require s ignifi cant dose reduction, according to glomerular filtration rate, as well as clinical vigilance for evidence of toxicity (confusion, dizziness, ataxia, drowsiness). Both are dialysable (useful in overdose). The pharmacokinetic behaviour of p henytoin is signifi cantly altered in renal insuffi ciency ( l variable absorption, d Protein binding, and i V ). Modest dose changes may 6 result in disproportionate side effects. d Therapeutic drug monitoring is also more complicated. Many laboratories measure total drug (i. e. Protein-bound and unbound). However, the proportion of free drug may be higher, so total levels are often misleading.",

Measurement of free drug levels may be available. (cid: 2) Phenytoin is also a potent enzyme inducer, with several important drug interactions. Valproate is not signifi cantly renally excreted and has fewer interactions. However, changes to the Protein binding may cause increased sensitivity. Levetiracetam, topiramate and vigabatrin undergo signifi cant renal excretion, and dose modifi cation is required. L amotrigine has metabolites that are renally excreted and should be used with caution.

Dialysis may also be helpful in overdose situations. 898 CHAPTER 12 Drugs and the Kidney Drug-related nephrotoxicity Introduction The kidneys role in the excretion of many drugs means that they are particularly vulnerable to drug-related toxicity. High renal Blood fl ow and 6 High renal drug delivery intensify this. The concentration of a drug in tubular fl uid and the medullary interstitium may be many times higher than that in plasma or other tissues. A variety of renal presentations and syndromes may result from drug toxicity ( b see Chapter 1, p. 7). This means that the drug history is an absolutely fundamental component of renal medicine. Antifungals Amphotericin Is associated with frequent and severe toxicity (50%). Risk factors: cumulative dose, infusion rate (continuous infusion appears less toxic), pre-existing renal disease, older age, concomitant diuretic use, electrolyte disturbances. Usually causes reversible acute kidney injury during treatment. Mechanisms: afferent vasoconstriction and increased tubular permeability. Prevention: adequate hydration, continuous infusion, correct electrolyte imbalances. Liposomal formulations appear less nephrotoxic (if signifi cantly more expensive). Distal renal tubular acidosis and urinary Mg2 and potassium wasting may also occur. d potassium is common and often signifi cant, requiring replacement. Note: beware the difference in doses across the different formulations. Antiviral therapy Aciclovir, valaciclovir, famciclovir, ganciclovir and valganciclovir May crystallize in renal tubules, causing reversible acute kidney injury, particularly in the setting of volume depletion and after IV bolus administration. Urine microscopy reveals birefringent crystals under polarized light (and haematuria). (cid: 2) All require signifi cant dose reduction in renal impairment and are freely dialysed ( b Table 12. 2). Cidofovir Causes reversible dose-dependent toxicity through the induction of proximal tubular apoptosis (l proteinuria, d glomerular filtration rate, interstitial nephritis, Fanconi syndrome, nephrogenic DI). Administer with hydration. Co-administration of probenecid has been used to slow renal tubular excretion and ameliorate toxicity. Foscarnet Frequently causes acute kidney injury, especially if given to volume-depleted patients. Pre-hydrate. Indinavir Is only poorly soluble at Urine pH 5. 5 7. 0. Precipitation causes crystalluria and tubular obstruction (l dysuria, haematuria, renal colic, fl ank Pain, and signifi cant renal impairment). Stones (radiolucent) may form. Pre-hydrate.",

Tenofovir A reverse transcriptase inhibitor, has been associated with a proximal tubulopathy. DRUG-RELATED NEPHROTOXICITY 899 Chemotherapeutic drugs Anti-cancer drugs are often given at High dose and have a relatively narrow therapeutic index. Toxic effects include acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, tubular dysfunction, and thrombotic microangiopathy. Methotrexate Is primarily renally excreted and requires a dose reduction, according to glomerular filtration rate. Renal toxicity is rare with chronic Low-dose administration (e. g. rheumatoid arthritis) but more common with High-dose regimens (e. g. cancer treatment). Best avoided if glomerular filtration rate 30mL/ min. Removed by hemodialysis ((cid: 2) but not continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis). Intrarenal drug precipitation causes tubular obstruction (l ATN and acute kidney injury). The administration of the recombinant bacterial enzyme carboxypeptidase (glucarpidase) can reduce toxic serum levels when renal impairment compromises clearance. Cisplatin Toxicity can restrict its clinical utility. Multiple mechanisms are involved (l vasoconstriction, i proinfl ammatory cytokines, tubular cell necrosis and apoptosis). Renal impairment may persist and progress despite cessation of therapy. Usually avoided if pre-existing renal disease. Other presentations: d magnesium 2, d calcium 2, tubular proteinuria, and (rarely) TTP. Prevention: hydration; maintain Good Urine output; use modifi ed daily dosing regimens, and restrict cumulative dose. Carboplatin is considered less nephrotoxic and may be preferred in many situations. Cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide May cause haemorrhagic cystitis (prevention: hydration and concomitant Mesna administration). Also: irreversible tubular toxicity (including Fanconi syndrome). Mitomycin and gemcitabine Have been associated with severe thrombotic microangiopathy. Immunomodulation therapy Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) Is generally well tolerated, but acute kidney injury can result from toxic tubular effects of carbohydrates in many formulations ( l cell vacuolization and Edema l progressive luminal obstruction). Diabetes and pre-existing renal disease appear to be risk factors. Prevention: avoid sucrose-containing products, slow infusion rate, adequate hydration. Interferon alfa Causes proteinuria ( 7 25%) and i serum creatinine ( 7 10%). A variety of glomerular lesions, including minimal change disease and crescentic glomerulonephritis, have been described. TTP also reported. (cid: 2) In addition, interferons can upregulate the expression of class II histocompatibility antigens, provoking rejection of transplanted organs. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) Ciclosporin and tacrolimus are widely used in transplantation, glomerular disease, and infl ammatory disorders. Both are associated with important nephrotoxicity. 900 CHAPTER 12 Drugs and the Kidney Acute toxicity Haemodynamically mediated and reversible. Often no structural damage. Responds to dose adjustment or drug withdrawal. Presents as an asymptomatic i serum creatinine (even where serum level is in the desired therapeutic range). This can mimic rejection in transplant recipients, triggering further investigation, e. g. a transplant biopsy ( b p. 416). Histology may be normal or reveal indicative tubular changes, such as vacuolization, tubular microcalcifi cation, or giant mitochondria. acute kidney injury is relatively common in post-Heart, lung, and bone marrow transplantation (although is not exclusively s to CNIs in this situation). CNI-induced thrombotic microangiopathy is an uncommon, but important, syndrome post-transplantation ( b p. 412). Chronic toxicity Characterized by irreversible and progressive tubulointerstitial fi brosis. Fibrosis typically a striped pattern from the medulla to the cortical medullary rays. Degenerative afferent arteriolar changes may be present. In non-renal transplantation, CNIs are linked to the development of chronic kidney disease, e. g. end-stage renal disease occurs in 7 1 8% of cardiac transplant recipients. Nephrotoxicity may increase with concurrent use of mTOR inhibitors, e. g. sirolimus, everolimus. Prevention: Therapeutic drug monitoring.

DRUG-RELATED NEPHROTOXICITY 901 Herbal medicines Herbal medicines, often dispensed in an unregulated manner, are a ubiquitous part of healthcare provision in many developing countries, and their use in the developed world has expanded considerably (see Table 12. 3). The Kidney is the primary route of excretion for many such compounds, and their potential for nephrotoxicity is increasingly recognized. The true global incidence of chronic kidney disease related to the ingestion of herbal remedies is currently unknown but could be very signifi cant. When suspected, reporting is desirable. Causes of toxicity Consumption of herbs known to have toxic potential. Consumption of herbs with unknown, or underappreciated, toxicity. Incorrect identifi cation l inadvertent ingestion of a toxic herb. Deliberate or accidental contamination of herbal products, e. g. NSAIDs or heavy metals (such as cadmium). Interaction with prescribed drugs.

There are at least two COX isoforms: most NSAIDs inhibit both, but COX-2 inhibitors (the -coxib family) are selective for COX-2 ( X and 6 possibly cause fewer GI side effects). Side effects Potent anti-infl ammatory and analgesic properties make these drugs amongst the most ubiquitous in the world. Adverse effects include: Renal toxicity ( b see below). GI side effects: dyspepsia, ulceration, and small and large bowel toxicity. Cardiovascular: i risk of CV disease and i blood pressure (X COX-2 non-selective NSAIDs). Bronchospasm. Liver toxicity: abnormal LFTs (although serious Liver failure is rare). Antiplatelet effects (d thromboxane A production). Benefi cial when 2 aspirin is given to modify CV risk but a potential adverse effect in other situations. Renal toxicity 2 NSAIDs should generally be avoided in the presence of either acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease, except in very select and carefully monitored situations. (cid: 2) NSAIDs are a very signifi cant cause of hospital-based acute kidney injury. NSAIDs and renal haemodynamics: NSAIDs have only a marginal effect on renal haemodynamics when Kidney function is normal. However, when renal Blood fl ow is impaired, they abolish prostacyclinand prostaglandin E -mediated compensatory afferent 2 arteriolar vasodilation, causing reduced glomerular perfusion. Clinically relevant situations include: pre-existing chronic kidney disease, CCF, sepsis, nephrotic syndrome, hypovolaemia, concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker use, concomitant gentamicin or other nephrotoxin use, increasing age.",

    "text": "NSAIDs also ameliorate the antagonistic effect of prostaglandins on ADH action. This antidiuretic effect can cause salt and Water retention, i blood pressure, and blunt the action of diuretics. Many of the renal effects of NSAIDs are mediated by COX-2, so COX-2 inhibitors appear equally nephrotoxic. (cid: 2) In general, always beware claims of more renal friendly NSAIDs, as there is limited supporting evidence.

Chronic interstitial nephritis (and 6 chronic kidney disease) with long-term use. Analgesic nephropathy ( b p. 584).

NSAIDS AND THE Kidney 903 Sulfasalazines Sulfasalazine is 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) coupled to a carrier sulfapyridine molecule that assists GI absorption. 5-ASA shares structural similarities with aspirin. Second-generation sulfasalazines (e. g. mesalazine) were designed to minimize troublesome haematological side effects. Such agents are effective and important treatments for infl ammatory bowel disease (IBD). There has been signifi cant historical concern regarding an association with acute interstitial nephritis. However, available data suggest this is actually relatively uncommon. Case control data from a UK primary care database suggested an adjusted odds ratio for renal disease of 0. 86 for current 5-ASA users and 2. 48 for recent users. Mesalazine and sulfasalazine appeared to carry comparable risks. Causality was unclear in the majority of cases. What is more important is to keep in mind that patients with IBD are at increased risk of renal disease, in general. In addition to 5-ASA toxicity, the differential of renal impairment in patients with IBD includes: Glomerulonephritis (e. g. membranous glomerulonephritis). Amyloidosis. Oxalate stone disease. If suspected, acute interstitial nephritis usually requires a diagnostic renal biopsy for confi rmation. In summary, all patients with active IBD are at higher risk of renal dysfunction and should have their renal function and urinalysis checked intermittently. This is particularly true of those treated with 5-ASA derivatives, who should have their renal function monitored every 7 3 6-monthly. 904 CHAPTER 12 Drugs and the Kidney Lithium and the Kidney Introduction Lithium is a very effective treatment for uniand bipolar affective disorders, allowing many patients to stabilize their symptoms and enjoy an excellent quality of life. Lithium clearance mirrors that of sodium: it is freely fi ltered at the glomerulus and predominantly reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. 7 20% is excreted unchanged in the Urine. Accumulation can occur in principal cells of the collecting duct, particularly if glomerular filtration rate falls ( l hypovolaemia, concomitant diuretics, NSAIDs, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor). Long-term exposure can cause tubular atrophy, tubular cyst formation, progressive interstitial fi brosis, and, eventually, glomerulosclerosis. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic window, and therapeutic drug monitoring is mandatory. The goal should be the lowest serum concentration that maintains adequate control of affective symptoms (e. g. 0. 4 0. 8mmol/L). Once-daily dosing regimens appear to have less potential to cause toxicity. Renal damage is related to both the average serum lithium concentration and cumulative dose. Any patient receiving lithium should have their renal function measured 6 12-monthly. Toxic effects Renal Nephrogenic Diabetes insipidus ( b p. 789). Lithium causes ADH resistance ( d aquaporin-2 expression). 7 50% of patients have impaired urinary concentrating ability and 7 25% develop polyuria and polydipsia (although these do not generally require cessation of treatment). Amiloride can be used to d Urine volumes in this situation, as it blocks lithium uptake through the collecting duct epithelial sodium channel (ENaC).",

Lithium use is a rare cause of hypercalcaemia (and mild hypermagnesaemia), which may further perpetuate renal damage. Chronic interstitial damage: Leads to progressive chronic kidney disease. Uncommon, although the true incidence is diffi cult to ascertain, as patients may have non-lithium-related causes of chronic kidney disease. Kidney biopsies are often not undertaken or reveal non-specifi c, non-diagnostic change only. Histological clues: microcytic change in distal tubules, with only limited interstitial infl ammation or vascular change. The mechanism of renal damage is unclear, but tubular cell uptake with impairment of cell proliferation appears important. LITHIUM AND THE Kidney 905 Once established, drug withdrawal may not stabilize renal function. Diagnosis does not necessarily mandate lithium withdrawal. Many patients will prefer to remain on lithium, rather than risk destabilization of their symptoms, particularly if their glomerular filtration rate is declining slowly. Careful individual assessment and explanation are necessary. Other GI disturbance. Goitre and thyroid dysfunction. Neurological including tremor and cognitive impairment. Treatment of acute lithium intoxication Complications: Common: tremor, thirst, polyuria, diarrhoea, and Vomiting. More severe: d GCS, hypertonia, seizures, focal neurological signs, cardiac arrhythmias, d blood pressure. Investigations: Serum lithium concentration. UE, serum creatinine. Management: Protect airway and monitor cardiac rhythm. Consider gastric lavage if early presentation post-ingestion (1h). No role for activated charcoal. Fluid-resuscitate: correct hypovolaemia using 0. 9% NaCl 9 0. 45% NaCl (if hypernatraemic). Haemodialysis ( b p. 906): Effectively removes lithium. Use High pump speed and large membrane for 4 6h. Indications for haemodialysis: Lithium level 3. 5mmol/L. Lithium level 2mmol/L with severe symptoms 9 d glomerular filtration rate. Rebound is common, as lithium moves from the intracellular to extracellular space. Recheck lithium concentration after 6h, and repeat Dialysis treatment, as necessary. 906 CHAPTER 12 Drugs and the Kidney Dialysis treatment of poisoning Introduction Although rarely necessary (0. 05% of all cases), Dialysis can be an effective way to treat drug overdoses and toxicity. Standard supportive measures for poisoning must still always be undertaken. Indications The poison (or its toxic metabolites) is removed by Dialysis. Favourable characteristics: Low MW (500Da). Relatively Low Protein binding. Small volume of distribution (i. e. confi ned to plasma volume). Water-soluble. Severe toxicity. Elimination is quicker via Dialysis, or native clearance is impaired (e. g. renal or hepatic impairment is present). Examples Methanol and ethylene glycol (b pp. 910912), lithium (b p. 904), aspirin (salicylic acid) (b p. 908), theophylline, barbiturates, antibacterials, antivirals, star fruit poisoning ( Averrhoa carambola ). Techniques Haemodialysis The goal is to remove as much of the drug/toxin as possible. Use a High effi ciency dialyser with a large surface area (1. 5m2 ). High pump speeds; Blood fl ow 300mL/min. Long treatment (4 8 hours). Complications: The patient often does not have renal impairment, so overcorrection of electrolyte imbalances may occur. d PO may occur and require correction (phosphate is not present 4 in standard dialysate solutions). d potassium. Metabolic alkalosis. Haemofi ltration Haemofi ltration is less effective than hemodialysis for drug and toxin elimination but is often the only technique immediately available. Haemodiafi ltration improves clearance and is the preferred continuous technique. Peritoneal Dialysis peritoneal dialysis is less effi cient and rarely used in this context. Dialysis TREATMENT OF POISONING 907 Haemoperfusion Involves circulation of Blood through an extracorporeal circuit, containing an adsorbent (activated charcoal, carbon, or a polystyrene resin). Requires a similar circuit to hemodialysis, but without dialysate, and generally with the adsorbent contained within a cartridge. The circuit requires anticoagulation with heparin.",

Complications: hypocalcaemia, hypoglycaemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia. Less widely available than Dialysis or fi ltration. 908 CHAPTER 12 Drugs and the Kidney Salicylate poisoning Introduction Salicylate poisoning remains relatively common. In addition to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), methyl salicylate is present (in large amounts) in oil of wintergreen preparations used topically for musculoskeletal ailments. After absorption, salicylate is rapidly converted to salicylic acid. In overdose, absorption may be delayed 4 6h as a consequence of pylorospasm, delayed gastric emptying, tablet clumping, or the ingestion of extended-release formulations. Salicylate handling Under normal circumstances it is highly Protein-bound (90%) and undergoes hepatic metabolism to salicyluric acid, which is both less toxic and more rapidly excreted by the Kidney than salicylate. Only a small amount is excreted unchanged by the kidneys. However, in overdose, Protein binding falls; Liver conjugation pathways are saturated, and renal excretion (via the anion secretory pathway in the proximal tubule) becomes more important. Drug t increases from 7 2 4h to 20h. 1/2 Salicylate actions Medullary trigger zone stimulation l nausea and Vomiting. Medullary respiratory centre stimulation l hyperventilation. Cyclo-oxygenase inhibition ld prostaglandin, d prostacyclin, and d thromboxane synthesis ( l platelet dysfunction and gastric injury). Cellular injury l disturbed metabolism (including oxidative phosphorylation) l metabolic acidosis. Acidbase considerations An assortment of acid base disturbances are possible, following salicylate overdose: Direct salicylates stimulation of the respiratory centre l hyperventilation l initial d pCO l respiratory alkalosis. 2 Accumulation of organic acids (including lactic acid and keto-acids) l i anion gap l metabolic acidosis. Salicylate itself has an insignifi cant effect on pH, as serum concentrations are relatively Low. A p respiratory acidosis is unusual and indicates severe poisoning ( (cid: 2) or the co-ingestion of a respiratory depressant). Most patients present with either a p respiratory alkalosis or mixed p respiratory alkalosis and p metabolic acidosis. Symptoms and signs May correlate poorly with serum levels (esp. in the elderly): Nausea, Vomiting, diarrhoea, epigastric Pain. i respiratory rate. Tinnitus, vertigo, blurred vision, SALICYLATE POISONING 909 Agitation, swearing, tremor, confusion, seizures, respiratory depression, coma, hyperthermia, cerebral oedema (esp. if severe acidosis l salicylate crosses the Blood brain barrier more easily if non-ionized). Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema ( i vascular permeability), arrhythmias. 3 Treatment of salicylate poisoning Monitor in HDU setting. O as required. 2 Investigations: UE ( i or d potassium, d HCO ), ABG ( 2 4-hourly ), lactate, 3 glucose (hypoglycaemia common), LFT, FBC (GI bleeding is rare), i INR, ECG, and CXR (pulmonary oedema). Salicylate level e very 2h until falling: Therapeutic level are 300mg/L (2. 2mmol/L). Moderate toxicity 500 750mg/L (3. 6 5. 4mmol/L). Severe overdose 750mg/L (5. 4mmol/L). Exclude other drug ingestions ( (cid: 2) paracetamol and respiratory depressants, such as benzodiazepines). Gastric lavage if presenting within 1h of ingestion. Later if delayed gastric emptying suspected. Activated charcoal (50g x 3 at 4-hourly intervals) may be effective. Optimize fl uid status: Aim for Urine output 100mL/h. Alkalinize the Urine (salicylate is more soluble at i pH). Give NaHCO 1. 26% IVI (e. g. 1L over 4h, repeated, as necessary, with 3 regular clinical assessment of fl uid status) until Urine pH 7. 5 8. 5.

Repeat Dialysis treatment may be required if levels rebound (s to delayed salicylate absorption). 910 CHAPTER 12 Drugs and the Kidney Ethylene glycol poisoning Introduction Ingestion of ethylene glycol (EG) is usually accidental when imbibed as an ethanol substitute. It is widely used in antifreeze and solvents. EG is rapidly absorbed and metabolized in the Liver (by alcohol dehydrogenase) to glycolaldehyde, then to various acids (including glycolic, glyoxylic, and oxalic). Ingestion of just 50 100 mL can be lethal. These acids are responsible for EG toxic effects. Glycolic acid is cleared by the Kidney and is the dominant cause of the anion gap acidosis, characteristic of severe cases. Tissue calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals are the cause of cerebral oedema and renal failure. Concomitant ethanol ingestion will be protective by blocking the metabolism of glycol to toxic metabolites. Symptoms and signs (cid: 2) Patients may not admit to ingestion and can present in any of the following stages. Stage 1 (30min 12h): inebriation, although often no alcoholic fetor, nausea and Vomiting, convulsions (may be focal), nystagmus, ataxia, visual disturbance, ophthalmoplegia, papilloedema, hypotonia, hyporefl exia, myoclonic jerks, cranial nerve palsies, altered conscious level, coma. Metabolic acidosis (with i AG). Stage 2 (12 24h): i respiratory rate, tachycardia, i blood pressure, pulmonary oedema. Stage 3 (24 72h): fl ank Pain, renal tenderness, acute kidney injury, d Ca2 , crystalluria (calcium oxalate), i potassium, d Mg2 . Investigations ABG: i AG metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation (mainly glycolic acid, but lactate may contribute). Lactate may also be spuriously High, as many analysers report an elevated glycolate as lactate). 2 The degree of acidosis correlates with tissue injury and outcome. Ethylene glycol level: may be normal if ingestion 12h prior to measurement. 500mg/L (8mmol/L) indicates severe toxicity. Check ethanol, methanol, and isopropyl alcohol levels if suspected co-ingestion. Other: UE, Ca2 , FBC ( i i WCC). LFTs, paracetamol, and salicylate levels ((cid: 2) beware co-ingestion), Urine microscopy for crystals (needle-shaped calcium oxalate monohydrate). If undertaken, a renal biopsy would show widespread tubular crystal deposition with ATN. Osmolality and anion gap: measured serum osmolality is raised, but calculated osmolality (2 x sodium urea glucose) is often normal. The difference between the two is termed the osmolar gap (often 10mOsmol/kg). This develops as patients absorb glycol over the fi rst few hours post-ingestion. Subsequently, as glycol is metabolized to acids, the osmolar gap falls while the anion gap increases and systemic acidosis worsens. (cid: 2) Other toxic alcohols also raise the osmolar gap. ETHYLENE GLYCOL POISONING 911 Management Gastric lavage if 1h since ingestion. If within 12h of ingestion, administer fomepizole (4-methypyrazole). Competes with EG for alcohol dehydrogenase, preventing rapid accumulation of toxic metabolites (8, 000 x greater affi nity than ethanol). It is relatively easy to use. Loading: 15mg/kg IVI in 100mL normal saline over 30min. Maintenance: 12-hourly doses of 10mg/kg (increase frequency 4h if Dialysis is required fomepizole is dialysable). The dose is increased to 15mg/kg 12h after 48h treatment. Continue until acidosis has resolved and EG level 200mg/L (3. 2mmol/L), or preferably undetectable. If fomepizole is not available, then administer ethanol. Ethanol is much more diffi cult to use: (cid: 2) intoxication and respiratory depression.",

Each Kidney contains 7 1 million nephrons. There are fi ve parts to the nephron (see Fig. 13. 1): The glomerulus, which acts as the Blood Kidney interface. Plasma is fi ltered from capillaries into Bowman s capsule before heading off down the nephron. The proximal convoluted tubule where most of the fi ltered load is reabsorbed ( 7 60%). The loop of Henle, which is able to concentrate Urine because of the High osmolality of the surrounding medullary interstitium. This High concentration of solutes is maintained by the countercurrent multiplier system. The distal convoluted tubule, which fi ne-tunes solute and Water reabsorption. The collecting system is formed by the convergence of several nephrons to create a collecting duct. These progressively amalgamate, as they cross the medulla, until opening into papillary ducts in the renal pelvis. There are two types of nephrons, those localized to the cortex and those extending into the medulla, the latter characterized by longer loops of Henle and additional metabolic activity. Renal Blood supply: Renal artery l renal sinus l interlobar arteries (occupy the space between the renal pelvis and adjacent cortical tissue) l divide at the corticomedullary junction l branching arcuate arteries l interlobular arteries (traverse the cortex). No arteries penetrate the medulla. The kidneys are unique for possessing two capillary beds in series. The glomerular capillaries are maintained at the High Hypertension required for fi ltration.

This arrangement allows for large volumes of fl uid to be fi ltered and reabsorbed. Functions of the Kidney Glomerular fi ltration rate ( b p. 30): This refers to the fi ltrate of plasma crossing the glomerular barrier into the urinary space per unit time across all functioning nephrons (usually expressed in milliliters per minute). Tubular function: The renal tubules reabsorb 7 99% of the glomerular fi ltrate, enabling them to regulate electrolyte excretion and to concentrate or dilute Urine, according to physiological circumstances. RENAL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION 915 Production of Urine The production of Urine is the result of three processes within the Kidney: Glomerular fi ltration. Selective and passive reabsorption within the renal tubules. Excretion from the distal nephron into the urinary tract. Acid base regulation ( b p. 818). The kidneys and lungs work together to maintain an arterial pH of 7. 35 7. 45. The lungs excrete CO. The kidneys: (i) prevent HCO 2 3 loss; (ii) excrete H ; and (iii) buffer urinary H. Endocrine functions: Renin: produced by specialized cells within the juxtaglomerular apparatus ( b p. 456). Erythropoietin: produced by the peritubular interstitial fi broblasts in the outer medulla and deep cortex ( b p. 218). The kidneys are also an important site of action of several hormones, e. g. aldosterone (promotes sodium reabsorption), ANP (promotes sodium loss), and ADH (increases distal tubular permeability, allowing urinary concentration). Autocrine function: Production of NO, endothelins, prostaglandins, natriuretic peptides. Protein and polypeptide metabolism, e. g. metabolism of insulin.

The glomerulus comprises a tuft of specialized capillaries attached to the mesangium, both of which are enclosed in a pouch-like extension of the tubule called Bowman s capsule. Bowman s capsule is a pocket of epithelial cells in continuity with the epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT). Blood is fi ltered through the capillaries of the glomerulus into Bowman s capsule, and it can then start its journey down the remainder of the nephron (see Fig. 13. 2). Bowman s capsule contains: Capillaries A knot of capillaries lined by endothelial cells. Blood fl ows in via the afferent arteriole and out via the efferent arteriole (for a capillary bed to have arterioles on both ends is unique in the circulation). Changes in afferent and efferent arteriolar tone are powerful ways of regulating Blood fl ow and Hypertension within the glomerulus (b p. 920). The capillary endothelium contains large fenestrae. This renders it considerably more permeable ( 7 100 x ) than most capillary beds. A strong ionic glycocalyx helps with charge selection. The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) The GBM is a non-cellular layer, consisting mainly of glycoproteins (esp. type IV collagen), sialoglycoproteins (e. g. laminin, fi bronectin), proteoglycans (e. g. heparin sulfate). It is manufactured mainly by podocytes and is the principal fi ltration barrier.",

    "text": "It is manufactured mainly by podocytes and is the principal fi ltration barrier. On electron microscopy, it consists of three layers: the lamina interna, lamina densa, and lamina externa. Epithelial cells (podocytes) Podocytes are specialized epithelial cells that produce the components of the GBM (under cytokine control). They have specially adapted foot processes (hence the name podocyte ) that possess a contractile apparatus. Interdigitating podocytes are separated from each other on the GBM by slit diaphragms , which constitute the key mechanical and signalling barrier to fi ltration. Podocytes produce podocalyxin (a sialoglycoprotein) to form a highly anionic coating that allows charge selectivity. Abnormal podocyte function is considered central to proteinuric nephropathies. Mesangial cells Mesangium is the remaining structural component of the glomerulus. Mesangial cells have an important regulatory function. Two main types have been identifi ed; most are derived from a smooth muscle lineage (and respond to similar stimuli). These are situated adjacent to the endothelium (within the GBM) and are active in signalling, recruitment of non-resident cells, and maintenance of vascular tone. Other mesangial cells are derived from macrophages and monocytes and possess phagocytic properties. Mesangial cells are embedded in an extracellular matrix containing collagen IV and V, fi bronectin, laminin, and proteoglycans. Mesangial cell activation and proliferation occur in response to immune-mediated glomerular injury. THE GLOMERULUS 917 The glomerular fi lter See Figs 13. 3 and 13. 4. The glomerular fi lter is composed of four layers: Charged endothelial glycocalyx. Endothelial fenestrations. The glomerular basement membrane. The inter-podocyte slit diaphragm. The inter-podocyte slit diaphragm offers a mesh of interlocking proteins and lipids, including nephrin, podocin, CD2AP, and podocalyxin. Podocyte dysfunction (at the Heart of many proteinuric nephropathies) impairs both the slit diaphragm and foot process adhesion. Filtration is principally determined by molecular size and, to a much lesser extent, by charge. The glomerular barrier is very permeable to Water. Substances with a MW 5, 000Da are freely fi ltered (unless albumin-bound in plasma). Larger molecules are partially fi ltered, with fi ltration fraction depending on both size and charge. Negatively charged molecules have a lower fi ltration fraction than similarly sized cationic molecules. Albumin (MW 61kDa) is polyanionic and scarcely fi ltered under normal circumstances. Approximately 70, 000g passes through the glomerulus every 24h, of which just 7g (0. 01%) appears in the fi ltrate (and this is usually reabsorbed further down the nephron). 918 CHAPTER 13 Renal physiology Extra-glomerular matrix Mesangial cells Macula densa Efferent arteriole Afferent arteriole Glomerular basement membrane Fenestrated Podocytes endothelium Foot process Urinary space Parietal epithelium elubut lamixorP Fig. 13. 2 Glomerular structure.

Oxford, Oxford University Press. 920 CHAPTER 13 Renal physiology Regulation of glomerular filtration rate Introduction glomerular filtration rate is dependent on the net hydrostatic and colloid osmotic Hypertension gradients between glomerular plasma and the fl uid in Bowman s space. This will be determined by: Renal Blood fl ow (RBF): Renal Blood fl ow represents 20 25% of cardiac output (1. 25L/ min). Two to three million nephrons produce an ultrafi ltrate of plasma (125mL/min or 7 170L/day). Most Water and solutes are all reabsorbed into the tubular epithelium. Glomerular structure (fi ltration surface area and permeability). Transglomerular capillary Hypertension (afferent efferent tone). Plasma oncotic Hypertension. Physiological regulation Autoregulation Preserves renal Blood fl ow and glomerular filtration rate despite variations in systolic blood pressure. Predominantly effected by the afferent arteriole: local stretch receptors quickly adjust afferent arteriolar tone via a myogenic refl ex . Afferent and arteriolar tone Controls intra-glomerular Hypertension and fl ow: Increased afferent arteriolar tone (vasoconstriction) leads to r educed fl ow and reduced Hypertension within the glomerulus. Increased efferent arteriolar tone (vasoconstriction) leads to r educed fl ow and increased Hypertension within the glomerulus. Tubuloglomerular feedback TGF allows tubular fl ow sensing to change glomerular filtration rate: chloride delivery to the juxtaglomerular apparatus is sensed at the macula densa (b p. 921). i distal chloride delivery l afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction l d glomerular filtration rate (mediators include adenosine, adenosine triphosphate, thromboxane, NO, and A2). The importance (and beauty) of this mechanism can be appreciated if large quantities of chloride (and thus sodium ) are pathologically delivered to the distal tubule (e. g. non-oliguric ATN). Through TGF, d renal Blood fl ow leads to d glomerular filtration rate, safeguarding against profound diuresis and volume depletion. In other words, TGF basically aims to avoid volume depletion/ overload if glomerular filtration rate i or d. Systemic factors The sympathetic nervous system (noradrenaline/norepinephrine) is a key mediator of vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole. Thus, in systemic hypotension ( l i sympathetic activity), renal Blood fl ow is reduced (allowing Blood to be diverted to the brain and Heart). Noradrenaline also stimulates production of renin and A2.

    "text": "It comprises the macula densa, extra-glomerular mesangium, and arterioles (the last part of the afferent and the fi rst part of the efferent). The macula densa is situated toward the end of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (i. e. in the distal nephron) (see Fig. 13. 1). The cells of the macula densa are closely packed with large nuclei and attached to a basement membrane that is intimately related to the extra-glomerular mesangium. They contain large amounts of NO and cyclo-oxygenase. Modifi ed smooth muscle cells, called granular cells, surround the afferent arteriole. Granular refers to conspicuous cytoplasmic granules containing renin that is ready for exocytosis into the surrounding interstitium. Granular cells have dense sympathetic innervation. Tubular chloride is sensed in the macula densa as part of tubuloglomerular feedback ( b p. 920). This instigates changes in glomerular Blood fl ow and glomerular filtration rate via arteriolar haemodynamics. Renin release is also controlled by this system, although the exact mechanisms are unclear. 922 CHAPTER 13 Renal physiology Tubular function: overview Introduction The tubular epithelium is a single cell layer. The cells have a distinct polarity (determined by their cytoskeleton). Their luminal (apical or tubular) surface is exposed to fi ltrate and their basolateral surface to interstitial fl uid (and capillary beds). Specifi c transporters are located in the membranes at each of these surfaces. There is a tight junction between cells near the luminal side. Solute and Water movement may be passive via paracellular routes (regulated via the tight junction) or active via transcellular routes (regulated via the membrane transporters). This movement may be from tubular fl uid to Blood (reabsorption) (see Table 13. 1) or from Blood to tubular fl uid (secretion). The four sections of the renal tubule are described on b p. 914. Basic concepts The tubules: Reabsorb the majority of the fi ltrate (mainly the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT)). Given that 7 180L of plasma is fi ltered each day, an enormous amount of reabsorption is required. Regulate solute and Water balance (PCT, loop of Henle (LH), distal tubule (DT), and collecting ducts (CD)). Regulate acid base balance (DT and CD).

Carrier-mediated diffusion where a specifi c membrane carrier assists transport across the cell membrane. A specifi c membrane channel. Active transport refers to an ion being moved against a concentration, or charge, gradient. It requires energy (from enzymatic hydrolysis of ATP). The most important active transporter is the Sodium pump (sodium potassium -ATPase). Another example of an active transporter in the tubule is the H ATPase (excretes H in the distal nephron). TUBULAR FUNCTION: OVERVIEW 923 The Sodium pump (sodium potassium -ATPase) Transfers three sodium from inside a cell in exchange for two potassium (this imbalance means it moves a net positive charge). In the Kidney, it is found exclusively at the basolateral (capillary) surface of the tubule and plays a prime role in tubular reabsorption. It keeps intracellular sodium concentration very Low (10 30mmol/L) and potassium concentration very High ( 7 150mmol/L). sodium will then want to move back into the cell down the electrochemical gradient that has been created this occurs either through specifi c Sodium channels or via carrier proteins.",

    "text": "These carrier proteins provide an opportunity for co-transport of other ions into the cell (e. g. potassium and chloride ) or countertransport out of the cell (e. g. H and calcium 2 ) against concentration, or charge, gradients, i. e. to take advantage of the movement of sodium. Glomerulo-tubular balance The process whereby a change (i or d ) in glomerular filtration rate is compensated for by a corresponding change in absorption by the rest of the nephron. This prevents changes in the fi ltered load having major consequences for solute excretion. For example, the amount of Sodium reabsorbed in each nephron segment is, in general, proportional to the amount of Sodium delivered to that segment. The mechanisms underlying this are poorly understood. 924 CHAPTER 13 Renal physiology The proximal convoluted tubule Introduction The PCT reabsorbs the bulk of Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, amino acids, urate, Water ( 7 60%), and Low molecular weight proteins (e. g. B 2 microglobulin). Appreciable amounts of Ca2 and PO are also 4 reabsorbed here (see Table 13. 1). It is not homogenous it consists of two parts, a convoluted (cortical) section and a straight (medullary section). The average PCT is 7 14mm long and offers a large surface area (due to the villous-like arrangement at the apical surface of epithelial cells). The normal Kidney contains around 1, 000, 000 glomeruli; this equates to a potential surface area for reabsorption of 50m2. The PCT is rich in mitochondria. The PCT is able to reabsorb up to 65% of the 24, 000mmol of sodium and 180L of Water fi ltered per day. Sodium and chloride In the early part of the PCT, most Sodium is reabsorbed via specifi c transporters (see Fig. 13. 5), coupled with absorption of glucose and organic molecules. A further transporter exchanges sodium with H ions. The energy for these processes comes from the Sodium gradient into the cell, itself generated by the sodium potassium -ATPase ( b p. 923). The gap junctions between epithelial cells are slightly leaky, so the PCT is highly permeable to Water. In the early PCT, chloride (an excess is generated when Sodium is absorbed with other anions or molecules) is reabsorbed via the paracellular route. Further along the PCT, sodium and H are exchanged, while chloride is exchanged for another base (e. g. formate, bicarbonate, oxalate) (see Fig. 13. 6). The base and H are then reabsorbed, so the net result is reabsorption of NaCl. chloride leaves the cell in exchange for potassium or via specifi c chloride pumps. Potassium In this area of the nephron, potassium is mostly reabsorbed down a concentration gradient via the paracellular space. Bicarbonate (see also b p. 818) The PCT reabsorbs 90% of fi ltered HCO but does not acidify the 3 Urine. HCO reabsorption is accomplished by means of H secretion. 3 Dissociation of carbonic acid (H CO ) within epithelial cells yields an H 2 3 ion that enters the fi ltrate via the sodium /H exchanger in the luminal membrane (see Fig. 13. 5). The H combines with HCO in the fi ltrate to form 3 carbonic acid, which is rapidly converted to CO and H O by carbonic 2 2 anhydrase. This recycling of H means there is no net acid excretion at this point. CO enters the cell by simple diffusion and is converted back 2 to carbonic acid to start the cycle again. Within the cell, the HCO gener3 ated from carbonic acid dissociation leaves via the basolateral surface in exchange for chloride or in association with sodium.",

This allows the concentration of Urine to be varied widely. Structure The loop dives deep into the renal medulla and then back out into the cortex. It consists of a thin descending limb, a thin ascending limb (in some nephrons), and a thick ascending limb. There are important solute and Water permeability differences along the loop. The macula densa ( b p. 921) is found close to the thick ascending limb. Capillaries serving the loop accompany it on its journey. These vasa recta have a bespoke hairpin arrangement, as a standard capillary network would simply allow the medullary osmotic gradient to dissipate through equilibration with capillary Blood. This U-shaped organization allows Water loss and solute entry in the descending limb to be offset by Water entry and solute loss in the ascending. This passive exchange of Water and solutes perpetuates the hypertonic extracellular environment of the medulla that is crucial for Water homeostasis. It is referred to as countercurrent exchange . The thick ascending limb contains cells rich in mitochondria, enabling the active transport of electrolytes. The reabsorption of sodium, potassium , chloride, calcium 2 continues in this section of the nephron, and the majority of Mg2 is recovered here. Solute transport (See Fig. 13. 7) The descending limb is impermeable to sodium, but Water moves into the interstitium down the osmotic gradient. The result is a High luminal sodium and chloride concentration. sodium reabsorption is passive in the thin ascending limb (sodium and chloride move into the interstitium down a concentration gradient) and active in the thick ascending limb. The active process is again driven by the basolateral sodium potassium -ATPase (the Low intracellular sodium concentration it generates allows sodium entry from the lumen). This sodium enters principally through the sodium, potassium , chloride, chloride (NKCC) co-transporter, which is unique to this section of the nephron (and the target of loop diuretics) ( b p. 792).",

In addition, potassium re-enters the lumen through a luminal potassium channel (ROMK channel) a recycling process that is necessary to prevent potassium availability from becoming a limiting factor for the operation of NKCC. This movement of potassium back to the lumen also keeps it electrically net positive, which facilitates the passive paracellular reabsorption of sodium (as well as potassium, Ca2 , NH , and Mg2 ). 4 THE LOOP OF HENLE 927 Lumen Interstitium 3 sodium sodium 2 chloride ATP potassium 2 potassium potassium potassium chloride Ca2 Mg2 sodium Fig. 13. 7 Transport mechanisms in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The NKCC co-transporter is the key. Potassium can leak back into the lumen via the ROMK channel, rendering the lumen positively charged. This charge gradient facilitates passive reabsorption of Ca2 , Mg2 , and more sodium via the paracellular route. 928 CHAPTER 13 Renal physiology The loop of Henle: the countercurrent system Allows the concentration of Urine to be varied, according to physiological circumstances. The U shape of the loop and its capillary network, the differences in permeability (to sodium and Water) between the descending and ascending limbs, and the active reabsorption of sodium in the thick ascending limb all underpin the countercurrent system (see Fig. 13. 8). The system maintains an interstitial osmotic gradient that increases from the renal cortex ( 7 290mOsmol/kg) to the tip of the medulla ( 7 1, 200mOsmol/kg). The thin and thick ascending limbs are both impermeable to Water. Despite this Water impermeability, sodium is reabsorbed in this segment. This reabsorption of sodium (and chloride ), but not Water, leaves the tubular fl uid dilute and hypotonic ( l this region is often called the diluting segment). So: Isotonic fl uid ( 7 290mOsmol/kg) enters the loop from the PCT. As it progresses down the descending limb, it encounters medullary interstitial fl uid of increasing tonicity (the interstitium is hypertonic because of sodium reabsorption without Water in the thick ascending limb). The descending limb is p ermeable to Water (but not sodium ), so Water fl ows out, down an osmotic gradient, into the concentrated milieu of the interstitium. As this occurs, the tubular fl uid progressively equilibrates osmotically with its surroundings and becomes more and more hypertonic as the loop descends into the medulla. The effect is to concentrate the luminal fl uid so that, at the deepest part of the loop, both the luminal and interstitial osmolality reach up to 1, 200mOsmol/kg. In the ascending limb, sodium (and chloride ) are absorbed (via the NKCC transporter) without Water, generating an osmotic gradient of 7 200mOsmol/kg between lumen and interstitium at any given level. By the time the luminal fl uid reaches the distal tubule, it is dilute and hypotonic. It would remain dilute as it passes through the distal nephron and collecting duct, were it not for the action of vasopressin (ADH) ( b p. 933).

Countercurrent fl ow in the two limbs of the loop multiplies this gradient longitudinally. The result is a hypertonic interstitium in the inner medulla (urea also contributes to this hypertonicity see Box 13. 1 ). Thus, fl uid entering the distal tubule is hypotonic. Further sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule can make the fl uid still more hypotonic. If ADH is not present, the collecting duct is impermeable to Water, and dilute Urine is passed. If ADH is present, the collecting duct becomes permeable to Water, and the Urine becomes hypertonic as it passes through the medulla.

The distal convoluted tubule The distal convoluted tubule (DCT) is impermeable to the passive movement of sodium and chloride and Water (vasopressin does not affect Water absorption here). This allows large concentration gradients to develop when necessary (see Fig. 13. 9). Sodium 7 5% of the fi ltered sodium is reabsorbed in the DCT. The thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride co-transporter (NCCT) is the major route. Further sodium is absorbed by sodium /H exchange, and additional chloride by chloride / HCO exchange. H and HCO then combine in the lumen to form CO 3 3 2 and H O (the CO can be reabsorbed and recycled). The energy for the 2 2 action of the NCCT co-transporter is again derived from sodium potassium -ATPase, as the resulting electrochemical gradient permits sodium reabsorption into the cell. Calcium Absorbed via a specifi c epithelial Ca2 channel under the infl uenced of parathyroid hormone and calcitriol. Thiazide diuretics block the NCCT co-transporter. They also enhance calcium 2 absorption (exact mechanisms unknown), reducing calcium excretion in the Urine. Hypokalaemia occurs, as there will be an increase in sodium delivery to the collecting ducts and 6 additional uptake via ENaCs ( b p. 931). This will increase activity of the basolateral sodium potassium -ATPase, and the resulting intracellular potassium will then move into the lumen and be lost in the Urine.

Intercalated cells secrete H ( A -intercalated cells) or HCO ( B -intercalated cells). 3 Changes in permeability of the collecting duct allow concentration of Urine under the control of vasopressin (ADH). Principal cells ( 7 65% of cells) (See Fig. 13. 10) Sodium Reabsorption from the lumen occurs via a specifi c sodium transporter, the epithelial Sodium channel (ENaC), and it then leaves the cell on the basolateral side via the sodium potassium -ATPase. (see Fig. 13. 10). Although only 7 5% of fi ltered sodium is reabsorbed here, this is the main site of body sodium regulation (see Box 13. 2). In contrast to sodium reabsorption higher in the nephron, it is predominantly the electrical, rather than concentration, gradient that drives sodium from the lumen into the cell (as the luminal sodium concentration may be as Low as 5mmol/L by this stage of the nephron). sodium potassium -ATPase generates a net negative charge within the cell, and sodium moves down this charge gradient via ENaC into the cell. As the tubular fl uid becomes more negatively charged, it favours potassium movement into the lumen. Potassium Enters principal cells on the basolateral side via the sodium potassium -ATPase and then move into the lumen (along the favourable charge gradient discussed previously) via specifi c aldosterone-sensitive potassium channels (aldosterone promotes potassium excretion). High urinary fl ow rates help to maintain Low intraluminal potassium concentrations, allowing the gradient to persist and the channel to operate. Hence, hypovolaemia can l hyperkalaemia. Box 13. 2 Control of sodium excretion Aldosterone, after binding its mineralocorticoid receptor, increases the number of open ENaC channels, regulating sodium absorption (and excretion). It also increases the number and activity of the sodium potassium -ATPase (it can double the surface area of the basolateral membrane). Atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) also acts on ENaC, with i ANP l inactivation of ENaC. sodium delivery: d delivery l i ENaC activity, thereby reducing sodium loss in the Urine (and preventing volume depletion). Vasopressin (ADH) may also be important through an increase in ENaC numbers and activity. Locally produced P GE decreases ENaC activity. 2 2 Amiloride and t riamterene block ENaC, thus reducing both sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. S pironolactone inhibits the effect of aldosterone on its receptor, with similar effects on sodium and potassium. 932 CHAPTER 13 Renal physiology Intercalated cells These cells are essential to acid base homeostasis. There are two functional and morphological types. A -intercalated cells are tall, columnar epithelial cells, containing a luminal H ATPase that enables them to secrete protons. B -intercalated cells are fl atter cells that contain a basolateral H ATPase and a luminal chloride HCO exchanger (called pendrin) that enables 3 them to excrete base, The A -intercalated cells transport H ions out of the cell into the tubular fl uid. This is aldosterone-sensitive (aldosterone l i H excretion). H is generated (along with HCO ) from the dissociation of carbonic acid via 3 carbonic anhydrase. HCO is then returned to the circulation in exchange 3 for chloride ions via a different basolateral chloride HCO co-transporter (called 3 AE1 Protein) (see Fig. 13. 11). Metabolic acidosis converts the collecting tubule from a state of HCO secretion to HCO absorption (and 6 H secretion) that involves a phe3 notypic shift of B -in 3 tercalated cells to A -intercalated cells.",

THE DISTAL NEPHRON 933 Vasopressin (ADH) Vasopressin, or antidiuretic hormone (ADH), is synthesized in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary in response to rising plasma osmolality (sensed by hypothalamic osmoreceptors) and/ or signifi cant hypovolaemia (sensed by arterial baroreceptors and atrial stretch receptors). Vasopressin acts via V receptors to stimulate thirst and systemic 1 vasoconstriction. In the Kidney: Vasopressin binds V receptors located on the basolateral membrane 2 of principal cells in the collecting duct. It acts to reabsorb Water in the collecting duct and 6 to concentrate the Urine. The duct becomes more permeable to Water by the translocation of specifi c Water channels (aquaporin-2) to the luminal membrane. Aquaporin-2 is stored in intracellular vesicles ready for membrane insertion (the basolateral membrane is already Water-permeable by virtue of aquaporin-3 and -4). The High interstitial osmolality, maintained by the countercurrent system, facilitates easy movement of Water ( b p. 928). Vasopressin also increases the permeability of the collecting duct to urea (b p. 929). Defects in aquaporin-2 structure and function underlie X-linked nephrogenic Diabetes insipidus (b p. 789). Increased intraluminal Ca2 concentration interferes with aquaporin-2 membrane insertion. This explains the observation that hypercalcaemia causes defective urinary concentrating ability, polyuria, and dehydration.

The risk of infection increases signifi cantly if in place for longerconsider switching to a tunnelled line if continuing access is required ( b p. 296). Routes of insertion The right internal jugular vein is the preferred route. It is superfi cial, technically easy to cannulate (in a virgin neck), and joins the SVC in a straight line. The left internal jugular is an alternative, but the guidewire and line have to curve in order to reach the SVC. The risk of malposition and malfunction (and perforation of the vein) is 6 greater. The femoral veins are suitable for short-term use and may be the safest and quickest option in an emergency (see b p. 180).",

    "text": "The subclavian route should be avoided: there is a higher risk of subsequent central venous stenoses, potentially rendering the ipsilateral arm unsuitable for permanent access in the form of an arteriovenous fistula. Pre-insertion Is the line really needed? Check that Dialysis is required and whether the patient is suitable for a tunnelled line ( b p. 296) or a peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion. Check FBC and clotting. The operator should obtain consent from the patient (verbal and/or a family member if too unwell). Warn about potential complications: Failure to cannulate vein. Haematoma 9 arterial puncture. Pneumothorax, haemothorax (and potential need for a chest drain). Air embolus. Catheter malfunction. Infection and its complications. Equipment: every renal unit should have a dedicated room for line insertion. It should be a sterile environment, containing a 2D ultrasound probe to facilitate vein cannulation. You will need: An assistant. Sterile gown, gloves, drapes, and towels. Iodine or chlorhexidine to clean the skin. An ultrasound device to guide line insertion. Dressing pack, with a supply of syringes, swabs, and needles. Sterile saline for injection. Lidocaine (1 or 2%): 10mL. Line pack (if pre-packed, will contain introducer needle, guidewire, and the line itself). Choose a shorter line (e. g. 15cm) for the RIJ route, longer line (e. g. 20cm) for the left side or the larger patient. Tri-Sodium citrate lock (Citralock ) (46. 7%) or Duralock have largely replaced heparin (5, 000 units/mL) to lock the line once it is in situ. INSERTION OF TEMPORARY HAEMODIALYSIS CATHETERS 937 Wash and dry hands, as for a surgical procedure; wear sterile gown, mask, and sterile gloves. Position the patient slightly head down (for right-sided insertion). Clean a wide area of skin around the insertion site. Lay out sterile drapes on all sides. Prime both lumens of the line with sterile normal saline solution. Tips for problematic line insertions Stop insertion if the patient is in Pain. Seek senior assistance. Pain probably indicates that the guidewire or line is in the wrong location. Venous Blood looks darker than arterial Blood and does not fi ll a syringe with its own Hypertension: if in doubt, put a 5mL syringe on either hub, and see if it fi lls in a pulsatile fashion. If still in doubt, perform an ABG. 1 Do not take the line out yet (see later in this list). Inadvertent arterial puncture with an 18-gauge needle can usually be controlled by Hypertension for 515min. If the larger introducer needle punctures the artery, it is often safest to abandon the procedure. Do not attempt the other side of the neck after signifi cant arterial puncture and haematoma (risk of airway obstruction, if bilateral). 1 If an artery is accidentally cannulated (i. e. the line is inserted), or if the vein is traversed such that the line tip is found to lie outside the vein, then leave the line in situ and seek expert help. Check FBC, clotting, and cross-match Blood. Confi rm your concern by aspirating Blood (if possible) for ABG from both lumens. If unable to aspirate, you are in the wrong place. Perform a CXR. If there is a rapid deterioration in the patients condition, a haemothorax or pneumothorax is likely, and an urgent chest drain may be required prior to CXR. Monitor closely: pulse blood pressure, and O saturation. 2 Find out where the line is: either a computed tomography or a contrast examination through the line to determine its location.

    "text": "The line must be removed under controlled conditions, with vascular/thoracic surgical input. Insertion technique Establish anatomical landmarks and the planned point of cannulation (see Figs 14. 1 to 14. 3). Ultrasound-guided insertion is now the technique of choice. Insert local anaesthetic under the skin. Always attempt to aspirate before injecting lidocaine to avoid inadvertent IV injection. Once the needle is in the vein, use a Seldinger technique. Pass the guidewire through the needle ( there should be no resistance if resistance is felt, do not force it, but remove the guidewire, and check the needle position. Do not advance the guidewire beyond the line length, i. e. 15/20cm, to avoid arrhythmias. Remove the needle, leaving the guidewire in situ. 938 CHAPTER 14 Appendices Use a scalpel blade to make a small nick in the skin. Pass the dilator over the guidewire until it is in the vein. Remove the dilator, keeping the guidewire in position. Without delay, pass the line over the guidewire until it is in position. Remove the guidewire. Vein localization Ultrasound-guided cannulation Most probes have a sterile disposable cover. Follow the manufac turers instructions. After infi ltration of local anaesthetic, identify the vein with the probe. The introducer needle can be inserted with real-time guidance. Blind insertion (no longer recommended) The approach can be medial to SCM muscle, between the two heads, or lateral to the muscle. Local practice and expertise will dictate the optimal route. Palpate the carotid artery with one hand (the left for a right-sided insertion). Insert the needle just lateral to the carotid pulse, aiming at 45 to the skin, in the direction of the ipsilateral nipple. Aspirate gently on the syringe, as you go, until the vein is reached. If unsuccessful, withdraw the needle slowly (continuing with attempted aspirationyou may have traversed the vein). Reinsert, varying the angle of insertion slightly to the medial side. If still unsuccessful, invite a colleague or senior to have a go before you (and the patient) lose confi dence. Once the vein is identifi ed with a green needle, pass the introducer needle down the same track, in the same manner, into the vein, palpating the carotid pulse at the same time. Check the fl ows in both lumens. A 20mL syringe should fi ll easily with minimal aspiration (general rule of thumb: 20mL should aspirate in 5s ( 240mL/min). Flush both lumens with saline (which should also be easy), and then lock with Citralock, Duralock, or heparin. The priming volume should be written on the line (typically 1. 32. 0mL/lumen). Put caps on the lumens, and suture the line in position. Arrange a CXR and review it yourself: look for line position (tip should be in SVC), and double-check there is no pneumothorax.

Relatively safe (haematoma can be controlled by Hypertension, no risk of airway obstruction or pneumothorax). No CXR required post-procedure (saves time in an emergency). Disadvantages over neck line Femoral line function can be highly positional, particularly in obese patients. Patients are also relatively immobilized. 1 H igh risk of infection lines should only be left in for 23 days max. Insertion technique The technique is identical as that for neck line insertion. Ultrasound guidance should be used. Position the patient horizontally or with feet slightly down. The hips should be partially abducted. Do not shave insertion site; if necessary, hair should be removed by clipping. Wear gown and gloves, prepare the skin, and use sterile drapes. For the right femoral vein, the fi ngers of the left hand should be used to palpate the femoral pulse. Take care to remain below the inguinal ligament so that a haematoma can be controlled with Hypertension. The vein runs just medial to this. Infi ltrate local anaesthetic, and try to identify the vein with a green needle. Use the track of the 18-gauge needle to insert the introducer needle into the vein. Angle the introducer needle towards the head to facilitate the passing of the guidewire. The remainder of the procedure is as for the internal jugular line. Tunnelled Dialysis catheters The dual lumen line is inserted into the internal jugular vein (usually), with a subcutaneous tunnel that acts as a barrier to infection. Tunnelled catheters may be used as semi-permanent access whilst awaiting maturation of an AV fi stula, or as permanent access for the patient unsuitable for an arteriovenous fistula or PTFE graft. Long-term complications include poor fl ows (and thus inadequate Dialysis), infection, and venous stenosis. A trained operator should insert tunnelled lines; ideally, under X-ray screening to ensure the tip of the line lies in the SVC. The complications of insertion are similar to the insertion of any central line.

Extreme care should be taken when preparing for theatre. Pre-admission Full history. Focus on cardiac and respiratory history, Dialysis regimen (if appropriate), and details about previous anaesthesia. Full drug history. Can the procedure be done under local or regional anaesthesia (this may be the case for an AV fi stula)? Examination. Listen for murmurs and bruits (carotids); examine peripheral pulses; check lung fi elds are clear; assess volume status; measure blood pressure, including postural blood pressure (and check blood pressure charts, if available). The anaesthetist will prefer a blood pressure of 150/95mmHg. Investigations. FBC (? anaemia which could be corrected pre-op, if possible), serum creatinine, UE ( i potassium ), LFT, Ca2 , ECG (any patient with advanced chronic kidney disease), CXR if breathless or abnormal cardiorespiratory examination. Echocardiogram if any new murmur or suggestion of poor LV function. Liaise with anaesthetist if any doubt about fi tness for anaesthesia or if further investigations are necessary.

    "text": "In addition, the pathology may differ in advanced chronic kidney disease with diffuse, calcifi c coronary arteries and microvascular disease. Vessels may be stiff and unable to compensate for changes in haemodynamics (e. g. d blood pressure, tachycardia), leaving the myocardium more vulnerable to ischaemic injury (even in the absence of thrombosis). 2 chronic kidney disease predicts mortality in ACS (and vice versa), but the secure diagnosis of ACS, especially in chronic kidney disease 5, can be challenging due to a number of factors. Atypical presentationatypical chest Pain, silent myocardial infarction, and hypotension/ collapse are more common. Atypical ECG typical ischaemic changes, including ST elevation, are less likely. LVH (and strain) may complicate interpretation. New regional wall motion abnormalities on echo may be required to confi rm diagnosis. Interpretation of cardiac enzymes (see Box 14. 2). Joint management between a nephrologist and a cardiologist, experienced with renal patients, is ideal. Management Broadly speaking, the treatment of suspected ACS is the same, but it is important to remember that patients with advanced chronic kidney disease are often excluded from large cardiology trials and have an inherently increased bleeding risk (uraemic platelet dysfunction), and that the underlying pathology may be fundamentally different. Give O to maintain normal saturations. 2 Treat Pain with opiate analgesia. If repeated dosing is required, consider fentanyl or oxycodone to reduce accumulation (b p. 271). Nitrates (sublingual or IV), titrated to Pain and blood pressure. Aspirin and clopidogrel are administered at standard doses. Glycoprotein IIa/IIIb inhibitors require dose reduction. One meta-analysis suggests that clopidogrel and glycoprotein IIa/IIIb inhibitors may increase bleeding risk without improving mortality in chronic kidney disease, 1 but the current consensus is to administer them for standard indications. ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS) IN chronic kidney disease 947 LMWHs are renally excreted. 50% dose reduction is required if glomerular filtration rate 30mL/min (e. g. enoxaparin 1mg/kg od) or use unfractionated heparin instead ( b p. 892). Beta-blockers (may require dose reduction b p. 892) should be titrated to pulse and blood pressure. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/ARBs should be carefully introduced once haemodynamically stable and no further angiography/surgery is planned. Statins ( b p. 893) have not been prospectively evaluated post-ACS in chronic kidney disease. Standard practice is to prescribe them. Anaemia is a predictor of poor outcome in ACS. There is no strong evidence that transfusing patients improves outcomes, and the potential benefi ts need to be weighed against the risks of volume loading and hyperkalaemia (Dialysis may be required). However, it is standard practice to target an hemoglobin 1011g/dL. ACS commonly causes a deterioration in serum creatinine in chronic kidney disease. Temporary RRT may be required. Both acute and chronic hemodialysis patients may be better on CVVHF or SLED initially ( b p. 174). STEMI: the standard of care is emergency PCI (see Box 14. 1). If unavailable, thrombolysis can be performed. Common renal contraindications include recent renal biopsy, recent line insertion (esp. if arterial puncture occurred), uncontrolled blood pressure 200/100mmHg, uraemic pericarditis. Box 14. 1 Angiography and PCI Commonly performed. Standard contrast nephropathy precautions apply, including for Dialysis patients with residual function (b p. 148). It is vital to monitor renal function for 72 hours post-procedure. Dialysis dependence may be precipitated. Calcifi c disease is less amenable to stenting, and rates of restenosis are higher. This may be reduced by drug-eluting stents, but prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy is required, which may complicate subsequent access procedures or transplant listing. Reference 1.

Effects of antiplatelet therapy on mortality and cardiovascular and bleeding outcomes in persons with chronic Kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis. A nnals of Internal Medicine, 156, 44559. 948 CHAPTER 14 Appendices Box 14. 2 Cardiac biomarkers in chronic kidney disease Troponin Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and I (cTnI) are proteins present in cardiac myocytes that may be detectable in serum when released following myocardial injury. Elevated serum troponin (esp. cTnT) is commonly found, even in asymptomatic patients, and does not necessarily indicate acute ischaemia. Contributing factors include LVH, the uraemic milieu itself, endothelial dysfunction, and reduced renal excretion. cTnI is more specifi c for ischaemia. Elevated troponins are not an inevitable consequence of renal impairment and are a poor prognostic marker, even in the absence of ACS. If ACS is suspected, it is best to measure serum troponin as soon as possible and again 12 hours post-event, as dynamic changes are generally more helpful than absolute values. Creatine kinase (CK) CK is frequently elevated in advanced chronic kidney disease. Causes include myopathy, vitamin D or carnitine defi ciency, and reduced renal clearance. Neither total CK, nor the more specifi c CK-MB, are reliable for the diagnosis of ACS. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) BNP is released from the cardiac ventricles in response to volume loading and promotes salt and Water excretion. BNP and its physiologically inert by-product NT-proBNP have been used in the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of Heart failure. BNP and NT-proBNP are commonly elevated in renal failure for a number of reasons, e. g. salt and Water handling is impaired, leading to volume overload and ventricular stretch, chronic i blood pressure and LVH, reduced renal excretion (esp. of NT-proBNP). As such, their utility in chronic kidney disease is very limited. ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS) IN chronic kidney disease 949 950 CHAPTER 14 Appendices Plasma exchange Introduction A technique in which plasma is separated from the rest of the Blood so that it can be removed and replaced. There are two main methods (see Fig. 14. 4): Centrifugation: removing plasma by centrifuging the Blood. Filtration: uses highly permeable membranes through which Blood is pumped at 7 100150mL/min. Plasma readily passes through the membrane pores (MW cut-off 7 2, 000kDa), but cells do not. In general, all immunoglobulins will pass through the membrane. A third technique involves two pumps and membranes and selectively removes large molecules, including antibodies (double fi ltration). This may be used when there is no doubt about the molecule that needs removing, such as anti-HLA antibodies in transplantation. However, in other diseases, such as ANCA-associated vasculitis, this is not so clear, and one of the non-selective methods is recommended. Anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit with heparin (e. g. 3060IU/ kg loading dose, followed by 1, 000IU/h) or citrate ( b p. 186) is required. Indications Diseases in which plasma exchange is used include: Anti-GBM disease. ANCA-associated vasculitis. HUS/TTP. Cryoglobulinaemia. Hyperviscosity syndrome. Recurrent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis post-transplant. Treatment of highly sensitized transplant recipients. Treatment of antibody-mediated transplant rejection. Non-renal conditions, including GuillainBarré syndrome and myasthaenic crises. Replacement fl uid and coagulation monitoring Approximately 60mL/kg, up to a maximum of 4L, of plasma is usually removed during an exchange. The major replacement fl uid in most cases is 5% human albumin solution. A single exchange will lower plasma macromolecules by 7 60% ( 7 90% after fi ve exchanges). In some conditions, such as HUS/TTP, the replacement fl uid is fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or Octaplas, as this provides part of the therapeutic effect.",

    "text": "1 If albumin is the major replacement fl uid, then 12L FFP or Octaplas may be needed at the end of the exchange if there has been a recent biopsy or pulmonary haemorrhage. In all cases, coagulation should be monitored (clotting factors are removed) and FFP or Octaplas given, as indicated. Cryoprecipitate or fi brinogen should be administered if fi brinogen levels are Low. Liaise with your haematology team. PLASMA EXCHANGE 951 Potential complications Hypotension (usually related to volume depletion). Hypocalcaemia: related to the use of citrate as an anticoagulant (and FFP contains citrate). Can be prevented or treated by calcium administration during the exchange, e. g. 24mL 10% calcium gluconate added to 500mL 5% human albumin. Clotting abnormalities and bleeding (see Replacement fl uid and coagulation monitoring). Complications of central venous catheter insertion and use: pneumothorax, haemothorax, infection ( b p. 936). Anaphylactic reactions to FFP (7 2%), infection from plasma products. Alkalosis from the metabolism of citrate. Dilutional d potassium. Immunoadsorption A technique that selectively removes immunoglobulin. This may be useful in particular circumstances, e. g. removal of anti-HLA antibody pre-transplantation. Replacement fl uids are not required, and there is no depletion of clotting factors. Uses Protein A columns that bind IgG (mostly) via the Fc domain. Plasma is fi rst fi ltered, prior to being run through columns containing immunosorbent-coated beads. Antihuman IgG antibody-coated columns are highly specifi c for human Ig but are very expensive. Protein A columns can be reused. 952 CHAPTER 14 Appendices (a) Membrane plasma filtration Arterial To patient Plasma Colloid collection replacement (b) Centrifugal cell separation Colloid replacement From patient To patient Spinning bowl Plasma collection Fig. 14. 4 Techniques of plasmapheresis. (a) Membrane plasma fi ltration: Blood fl ow 100150mL/min. Highly permeable membrane (MW cut-off 2, 000kDa)most Igs are removed, but some larger immune complexes and cryoglobulins may not be well cleared. Cells, along with fl uid replacement, are returned to the patient. (b) Centrifugation: plasma is removed by centrifugation, using a spinning bowl. Blood is (synchronously or intermittently) returned to the patient, along with replacement fl uid. No upper limit to the size of Protein which can be removed.
