Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of end-organ require regular, accurate blood pressure measurement. blood pressure was predominantly recorded using the mercury-based-sphygmomanometer. Recently, oscillometric-based devices have been invented and are commonly used worldwide. blood pressure measurement methods are broadly divided into Office-based and out-of-clinic (home). The patient at home or workplace conducts home blood pressure measurement, either intermittently (Non-ambulatory blood pressure monitoring NABPM) or continuously (Ambulatory blood pressure Monitoring ABPM). Despite the variety of blood pressure measurement methods, the ABPM method is the best method of blood pressure recording, especially in unstable (liable) blood pressure readings. NABPM is conducted less frequently in the nighttime, whereas ABPM is conducted day and night and gives more frequent stable blood pressure records. In ABPM, the mean of the measurements is automatically calculated and stored for later use or sent directly to the physician. Furthermore, some people may have an increase in blood pressure at nighttime or loss of the dipping blood pressure character, which increases the risks of High blood pressure complications. Hence, in this comprehensive review, we will discuss the different methods of blood pressure recording, their advantages and disadvantage, and their differences. Scopus, EMBASE, PubMed, Google, and Google Scholar were searched for the related reviews and original articles cited for blood pressure measurement methods and techniques.
