    "text": "As with prior editions, the writing remains consistently concise, precise, and decisive. I NTERESTINGLY, the booklet was originally conceived and written for the Henry Ford Health System. However, like the automotive industry of the City of Detroit, it has significantly transcended its local borders. All told, more than 30, 000 copies have been distributed within the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Canada since its original publication. From the first edition that provided textually based nuts and bolts management of chronic kidney disease through its fifth edition, the booklet has gained in quality and size, while providing up-to-date information. The first edition brought to the fore the importance of the estimated glomerular filtration rate in the screening of this under-recognized entity, chronic kidney disease. The second and third editions amplified the importance of the cardiovascular complications of chronic kidney disease. The fourth and fifth editions emphasized evidence-based practice across the continuum of chronic kidney disease care and provided colorful easy-to-read diagrams. Essentially, it is not a textbook steeped in information that is outdated by the time of printing, but a periodical that reliably informs Primary Care Physicians about chronic kidney disease essentials. Overall, the content is current and crystallized, ready for translation into clinical practice. D EDICATED readings of the HENRY FORD chronic kidney disease BOOKLET as it is known outside of the Henry Ford Health System are suggested in order to fully comprehend the complexity of chronic kidney disease. It should be on the must have list of Internal Medicine housestaff and Nephrology fellows-intraining as it continues to remain popular among the younger generation of physicians, nurses, and mid-level providers. Its Internet presence accounted for 1, 000 downloads in 2010. Translation into other languages is under consideration and there is clamor for mobile device distribution. Most importantly, the booklet has received plaudits from national organizations and societies, and its format and content have been adapted by multiple agencies, including the Michigan Quality Initiative Consortium (MQIC) and the National Kidney Foundations of Michigan and Illinois. 2 N EW information regarding the estimated glomerular filtration rate is highlighted in the SIXTH EDITION. As the underpinning of the stages of chronic kidney disease, knowledge regarding the functionality of the estimated glomerular filtration rate has matured, with validation across more populations. Standardization of the serum creatinine by isotope dilution mass spectrometry is occurring increasingly across clinical laboratories in the United States. This recalibration lowers the estimated glomerular filtration rate by 6%. Notwithstanding this improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate reporting, combining this parameter with proteinuria more clearly delineates the risk category of a chronic kidney disease patient. Principally, proteinuria of (cid: 1)2 on dipstick analysis or within the macro-albuminuric range portends a poorer renal outcome. Lastly, this edition prominently features an international perspective on chronic kidney disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder. E XPERT and representation of the respective clinical disease domains of chronic kidney disease distinguishes and enhances this version. Now, this mini-compendium renders an even broader perspective to chronic kidney disease with the following contributions: DIABETIC KIDNEY DISEASE by Susanne Nicholas (UCLA) HYPERTENSION by Debbie Cohen and Raymond Townsend (Univ. of Penn) PROTEINURIA by Julie Lin (Brigham and Womens Hospital) ANEMIA OF chronic kidney disease by Anatole Besarab (Henry Ford Hospital) NUTRITION IN chronic kidney disease by M.

KAMYAR KALANTAR-ZADEH, MD, MPH, PHD UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES 3 CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE STAGING AND PROGRESSION by Gregory D. Krol Introduction Optimal management of patients with chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) requires appropriate interpretation and use of the markers and stages of chronic kidney disease, early disease recognition, and collaboration between primary care physicians and nephrologists. Because multiple terms have been applied to chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease), eg, chronic renal insufficiency, chronic renal disease, and chronic renal failure, the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) has defined the all-encompassing term, chronic kidney disease. Using kidney rather than renal improves understanding by patients, families, healthcare workers, and the lay public. This term includes the continuum of kidney dysfunction from mild kidney damage to kidney failure, and it also includes the term, end-stage renal disease (end-stage renal disease). Definition and Interpretation Management of chronic kidney disease requires the clear understanding of its definition as proposed by the National Kidney Foundation (National Kidney Foundation). An informed interpretation of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate) is required, since the glomerular filtration rate is still considered the best overall index of kidney function in stable, non-hospitalized patients. Kidney damage is defined by any one of the following findings: a) pathologic kidney abnormalities b) persistent proteinuria c) other urine abnormalities, eg, renal hematuria d) imaging abnormalities e) estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 on two occasions separated by (cid: 1)90 days and that is not associated with a transient, reversible condition such as volume depletion. The 5 stages of chronic kidney disease are based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (see TABLE). CLASSIFICATION OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE Estimated glomerular filtration rate Stage Comment (milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2) 1 ≥90 Normal glomerular filtration rate w/ proteinuria 2 6089 Age-related decline in glomerular filtration rate w/proteinuria 3A 3059 Low risk of progression to kidney failure 3B 4 1529 High risk of progression to kidney failure 5 5D 15 Kidney failure 5T Because of greater cardiovascular disease risk and risk of disease progression at lower eGFRs, chronic kidney disease Stage 3 is sub-divided into Stages 3A (4559 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2) and 3B (3044 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2. chronic kidney disease Stage 5 includes patients that may require or are undergoing kidney replacement therapy. Designations 5D and 5T indicate end-stage renal disease patients who undergo chronic dialysis (5D) treatment or have undergone kidney transplantation (5T).",

    "text": "4 The estimated glomerular filtration rate is primarily determined by serum creatinine (serum creatinine), and the preferred method for estimating glomerular filtration rate is the body surface area-normalized, 4-variable, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) Equation based on serum creatinine, age, gender, and ethnicity. estimated glomerular filtration rate (milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2) 186 (serum creatinine)1. 154 (Age)0. 203 (0. 742, if female) (1. 212, if African American) Replace the constant 186 with 175, if the laboratory uses a standardized serum creatinine (IDMS method). This reduces estimated glomerular filtration rate by 6%. eGFRs based solely on blood urea nitrogen and creatinine or by 24-h endogenous creatinine clearances, are not required for routine screening of chronic kidney disease. As with all tests, the estimated glomerular filtration rate has limitations. estimated glomerular filtration rate calculations may be inaccurate in the following circumstances: acute hospitalizations, acute kidney injury (acute kidney injury)/acute renal failure (acute renal failure), malnutrition, major limb amputation, cirrhosis, severe obesity, and at the extremes of age. It is not recommended to use estimated glomerular filtration rate in lieu of serum creatinine during acute kidney injury/acute renal failure. Improved estimated glomerular filtration rate equations, chronic kidney disease-EPI and Cystatin-C equations, remain as research tools, and the 4-parameter MDRD estimated glomerular filtration rate remains the current gold standard. Regardless of the measure, most cases require appropriate appreciation of kidney function and must include an assessment of retrospective and prospective markers of kidney function aside from estimated glomerular filtration rate, including blood urea nitrogen and urinary protein excretion, in order to more completely assess etiology, stability, progression, or improvement in renal function, and to guide therapy. Normal physiologic age-related changes in kidney function often lower GFRs to 6090 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2. The age-related decline in glomerular filtration rate is 1 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2/yr, beginning after 3040 y. o. In addition and paradoxically, the reduction of muscle mass associated with aging may overestimate the glomerular filtration rate and potentially mislead the healthcare provider. Notably, the majority of chronic kidney disease Stage 3 or 4 patients will not develop chronic kidney disease Stage 5/kidney failure (1% risk). However, if other evidence of kidney disease is present, eg, proteinuria; imaging study revealing small (9 cm by ultrasonography) or echogenic kidney(s), cysts or stones; resistant hypertension (hypertension); or rapid or acute elevations of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, an etiology of chronic kidney disease must be established and aggressive therapy is warranted. Generally, a kidney-specific imaging study (renal ultrasonogram, computed tomography scan) is not required in the following clinical setting: estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 with no proteinuria because the overwhelming majority of such studies are normal. Epidemiology Persons with chronic kidney disease have significantly higher rates of morbidity, mortality, hospitalizations, and healthcare utilization. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease Stages 25 has continued to increase since 1988 as have the prevalences of diabetes and hypertension, which are respectively etiologic in approximately 40% and 25% of chronic kidney disease cases. The current estimate is that 26 million ultrasound persons 20 y. o. have chronic kidney disease. However, 15. 2 % is the more recent chronic kidney disease prevalence estimate, based on 20032006 NHANES data of U. S. adults aged (cid: 1)20 y. o. , a decrease from the 15. 9% cited in the NHANES data collected from 19992002. This decrease was reflected in chronic kidney disease Stage 1 as Stage 3 increased to 6. 5% from 20032006.",

    "text": "This decrease was reflected in chronic kidney disease Stage 1 as Stage 3 increased to 6. 5% from 20032006. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease Stages 4 and 5 has doubled since 19881999, but has remained stable since 2002 at 0. 6%. 5 chronic kidney disease stage prevalence from NHANES 20032006 by the chronic kidney disease-EPI equation are Stage 1, 4. 1%; Stage 2, 3. 2%; Stage 3, 6. 5%; and Stages 4 and 5 combined, 0. 6%. Stratified by age, all chronic kidney disease stages were more prevalent in persons aged (cid: 1)60 y. o. (39. 4%) than in those aged 4059 y. o. (12. 6%) or 2039 y. o. (8. 5%). By educational level, chronic kidney disease at any stage was more prevalent among persons with less than a high school education (22. 1%) than in persons with at least a high school education (15. 7%). chronic kidney disease prevalence was greater among non-Hispanic blacks (15. 6%), nonHispanic whites (14. 5%), and among other ethnicities (13. 1%). The prevalences of diabetes and hypertension in African Americans with chronic kidney disease were 60. 6% and 96%, respectively, compared to Caucasian prevalences of 45. 7% and 90. 7%, respectively (United States Renal Data Survey, 2010). Also, chronic kidney disease prevalence was higher in diabetics than non-diabetics (40. 2% v 15. 4%), in those with cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease) than in those without it (28. 2% v 15. 4%), and in those with hypertension than in those without it (24. 6% v 12. 5%). For 2010, the estimated cost of end-stage renal disease is 28 billion, and projected as 54 billion by 2020. In the last quarter of 2009, the prevalence of end-stage renal disease (N572, 569, includes kidney-transplanted patients) was greater than in 2005 (N485, 012). In terms of incidence or newly-initiated end-stage renal disease patients, diabetes was etiologic in 37. 5%, hypertension 24. 4%, glomerulonephritis 14. 8%, cystic disease 4. 7%, and others 18. 6%. African American patients are 3. 7 times more susceptible for development of end-stage renal disease, and Native Americans and Asians are 1. 9and 1. 3 times more likely to develop end-stage renal disease. Recognition, Screening and Stratification of chronic kidney disease Only 5% and 10% of the general Medicare population undergoes a screening urinalysis or a serum creatinine, respectively. The National Kidney Foundation KEEP (Kidney Early Evaluation Program) screening program is a free community-based survey that identified individuals with chronic kidney disease over the past 10 years. Since its inception, KEEP has screened 150, 000 at-risk individuals with diabetes and/or hypertension or those with a first-order relative with known kidney disease, diabetes, or hypertension. Urine was evaluated for hematuria, pyuria and microalbuminuria. The KEEP population was better educated, had more insurance, and a higher prevalence of hypertension, obesity, and diabetes than the NHANES cohort. Specifying chronic kidney disease as a low estimated glomerular filtration rate and/or presence of microalbuminuria, 26% of KEEP/high risk participants had chronic kidney disease nearly twice that noted in the general population NHANES study. Strikingly, only 2. 0% of these high risk patients self-reported a history of kidney disease. These consistent findings over the past decade underscore the lack of recognition and education regarding chronic kidney disease and the missed opportunities to better manage, prevent, and reduce chronic kidney diseases associated premature and increased comorbidties, mortality, and high healthcare costs. Stratification of chronic kidney disease into 5 stages focuses the clinician on chronic kidney disease management aspects. The metabolic abnormalities of chronic kidney disease evolve in a fairly well established pattern.",

Hypertension is aggravated in chronic kidney disease Stages 35 and acid-base balance, dyslipidemia, and glucose homeostasis become deranged later. During Stages 35, reductions in medication dosages may be required because of a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate. The disease domains of hypertension, proteinuria, and hyperlipidemia may appear at any stage and therapy must be targeted to specific levels. Lastly, screening for metabolic complications of chronic kidney disease is typically not recommended in persons with estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 and no albuminuria, unless a genetic disorder with a high degree of penetrance is present (autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease). The development of chronic kidney disease multiplies the mortality risk associated with cardiovascular disease, particularly in chronic kidney disease Stages 4 and 5. chronic kidney disease increases cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality risks in diabetics by 2to 4-fold and 6 in patients with hypertension and diabetes by 4to 8-fold. Further, chronic kidney disease-attributable cardiovascular disease risk increases rapidly through chronic kidney disease Stages 35 by several-fold. At-Risk Groups chronic kidney disease carries a 3-fold higher risk of death. Therefore, clinical risk factors for the initiation and/or progression of chronic kidney disease should be ascertained during routine healthcare encounters and periodically, thereafter. Individuals at increased risk for chronic kidney disease must be tested for kidney damage and have their eGFRs evaluated more frequently. In addition, aggressive risk factor reduction should be carried out in individuals at increased risk for chronic kidney disease even when chronic kidney disease is not clinically apparent. A chronic kidney disease risk factor classification, based on a cardiovascular scheme follows (see Table, p. 9). Hypertension (prevalence 74. 5 million) and diabetes (prevalence 23. 6 million) are the two most important chronic kidney disease risk factors. Overall, diabetes is prevalent in 44% of the end-stage renal disease population and in hypertension 28%. Together, these two disorders constitute 72% of the causes of end-stage renal disease. Recently, insulin resistance, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome have been implicated as risk factors. A family history of kidney disease is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease. Nearly 24% of end-stage renal disease patients have an afflicted first-degree relative, an association that is much stronger in African Americans than whites. Other chronic kidney disease risk factors include the following: a prior history of acute kidney injury/acute renal failure, urinary tract obstruction, stones, reduced kidney mass (solitary kidney), nephrotoxins (analgesics, aminoglycosides, amphotericin, radiocontrast), autoimmunity (SLE), low birth weight, preeclampsia, sociodemographics (older age, male gender, reduced access to healthcare, low income/education level, hazardous chemical or environmental exposures), and certain ethnicities: African American, Native American, Hispanic, and Asian. Acute Kidney Injury (acute kidney injury)/Acute Renal Failure (acute renal failure) The term acute renal failure is being increasingly supplanted by the term acute kidney injury, but precise and consensus-based definitions of acute kidney injury have only recently been introduced. acute kidney injury is common and occurs at a rate of 522 cases/100, 000 patient-yr. Thus far, acute kidney injury staging systems that define renal risk, injury, and failure have not consistently predicted renal or morbid outcomes due to select patient-specific demographics, preexisting chronic kidney disease and comorbidities (see TABLE, P. 8). Such systems require further refinement. acute kidney injury often complicates chronic kidney disease, particularly in Stages 35.",

    "text": "Such systems require further refinement. acute kidney injury often complicates chronic kidney disease, particularly in Stages 35. Persons with or without preexistent kidney disease may incur permanent decrements in kidney function after single or repeated episodes of acute kidney injury/acute renal failure. The optimal method of establishing chronic kidney disease is by examining medical records; renal imaging is the next best method, eg, kidney ultrasonography (ultrasound) or computed tomography scan. By ultrasound, normal, adult kidney sizes are 1012 cm in the sagittal plane; however, size discrepancies up to 37% may be found. acute kidney injury represents a substantial risk factor for progressive chronic kidney disease. A single episode of acute kidney injury may generate a steeper decline in renal function than normally expected from aging alone. Therefore, patients who develop severe acute kidney injury or recover slowly from acute kidney injury must be closely monitored, even when the estimated glomerular filtration rate returns to baseline. Rapid recovery of acute kidney injury (7 d) generally requires minimal follow-up, unless there was pre-existing chronic kidney disease. acute kidney injury is categorized as prerenal, parenchymal, and postrenal etiologies. To eliminate the latter from the differential diagnosis, always rule out urinary outlet obstruction when establishing an etiology for acute kidney injury/acute renal failure, particularly in males with clinically undiagnosed prostatic hyperplasia. acute kidney injury continues to occur with increasing frequency and constitutes 70% of Nephrology inpatient 7 consultations. The increased utilization of pharmaceuticals has increased the frequency of immune-mediated (allergic) tubulointerstitial nephritis, particularly from antibiotics. When challenged by sodium (volume) depletion, chronic kidney disease patients often develop acute kidney injury more rapidly than normal individuals. The consequent prerenal azotemia, from absolute (vomiting, overdiuresis) or relative volume depletion (cirrhosis, nephrosis or heart failure) accounts for nearly 40% of cases of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury. Administration of pharmaceuticals such as NSAIDs, antibiotics (aminoglycosides), or iodinated radiocontrast media can induce acute kidney injury/acute renal failure. Lastly, volume depleted patients are more susceptible to radiocontrast-induced nephropathy. This disorder accounts for 317% cases of hospital-acquired acute renal failure, and this is often preventable (see MEDICATION-RELATED PROBLEMS IN chronic kidney disease, P. 51). CLASSIFICATION OF ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY / ACUTE RENAL FAILURE Stage Serum Creatinine Urine Output 1 serum creatinine(cid: 1) of ≥0. 3 milligrams per deciliter 0. 5 mL/kg/h for 6 h Risk serum creatinine (cid: 1) of ≥1. 5-2. 0-fold 2 serum creatinine (cid: 1) of ≥2. 03. 0-fold 0. 5 mL/kg/h for 12 h Injury 3 serum creatinine (cid: 1) of ≥0. 3 milligrams per deciliter or 3-fold from baseline 0. 3 mL/kg/h for 24 h Failure serum creatinine ≥4. 0 milligrams per deciliter with acute (cid: 1) ≥0. 5 milligrams per deciliter Anuria for 12 h chronic kidney disease patients undergoing cardiothoracic and/or other emergent surgical procedures that occur with blood loss, sepsis and/or radiocontrast administration have highly increased risk for acute kidney injury/acute renal failure. In these circumstances, the glomerular filtration rate cannot be reliably determined since it depends on steady-state creatinine generation and elimination. chronic kidney disease patients treated with anti-RAAS medications commonly develop elevations of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine. The potential benefits of chronic anti-RAAS treatment likely outweigh a mild stable decline of glomerular filtration rate from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker use. Generally, increases in serum creatinine of up to 30% and serum potassium levels of 5. 5 milliequivalents per liter can be tolerated. However, unless moderate hyperkalemia (potassium 5. 5 milliequivalents per liter), oliguria, relative hypotension, or a substantial glomerular filtration rate reduction occurs, these agents should generally be continued.",

    "text": "Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (chronic kidney disease) Fortunately, most patients do not progress from chronic kidney disease Stage 3 to 5, but 17% of chronic kidney disease Stage 4 patients will progress to Stage 5 and 1% of chronic kidney disease Stage 3 patients will. However, the transition to chronic kidney disease Stage 4 is often insidious and under-recognized. Importantly, this transition represents a clinical event similar to a stroke or acute myocardial infarction because chronic kidney disease Stage 4 is marked by a major increase in cardiovascular mortality and progression to chronic kidney disease Stage 5. During chronic kidney disease Stage 4, death is a competing risk for progression to end-stage renal disease. Comprehensive systems targeting early recognition, prevention and management, and treatment by primary care physicians and physician extenders are required at this critical stage in collaboration with nephrologists. 8 Aside from uncontrolled hypertension, one of the strongest prognosticators for declining kidney function is proteinuria. A spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPC) or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio) quantifies proteinuria. Generally, UPCs 0. 51 g protein per g creatinine predict a more favorable prognosis, while UPCs 1 predict more rapid functional decline and more intensive evaluation, ie, kidney biopsy. Modifiable risk factors for chronic kidney disease progression are hypertension, diabetes, morbid obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypercholesterolemia, heavy consumption of non-narcotic analgesic preparations, anemia, and cigarette smoking. Perhaps the best prognosticator for chronic kidney disease progression is the rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate. Rates of decline 4 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 per year are associated with greater progression risk. In diabetics, annual estimated glomerular filtration rate rates of decline (cid: 1)1012 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 may occur. In heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate declines (cid: 1)15 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 per year are associated with worse anemia and progression to chronic kidney disease Stage 5. African American ethnicity is a major risk factor for progressive chronic kidney disease from type 2 diabetic kidney disease, hypertension (nephrosclerosis), and HIV. In general, Native Americans, Hispanics, and Asians have increased risk for type 2 diabetic chronic kidney disease. Cigarette smoking aggravates chronic kidney disease. Risk factors that promote the accelerated atherosclerosis of chronic kidney disease include elevated angiotensin II levels, proteinuria, secondary hyperparathyroidism, dysregulated calcium and phosphate metabolism, ECF volume expansion, and the intrinsic chronic inflammatory state of chronic kidney disease. Strategies that retard the progression of chronic kidney disease includes optimizing antihypertensive therapy; stringent glycemic control; cigarette smoking cessation; avoidance of cocaine, NSAIDs, and exposure to nephrotoxic agents; and dietary protein and phosphorus restrictions.

Int J Clin Pract 64(13): 1784, 2010 10 CONSULTATION by Jerry Yee Introduction In a survey, family medicine physicians (N89), general internists (N89), and nephrologists (N129) evaluated a case of progressive chronic kidney disease. Family medicine and internal medicine doctors recognized and recommended subspecialist care for progressive chronic kidney disease less frequently than nephrologists. Their opinions also differed from nephrologists regarding evaluations by and expectations of nephrologists. The survey recommended the following: a) greater dissemination of existing clinical practice guidelines b) targeted chronic kidney disease-specific education c) consensus-building and guideline development by family medicine physicians, internists, and nephrologists. Data from dedicated chronic kidney disease clinics corroborate these findings. Currently, there is a concerted effort from many nephrology societies, including AMA, AHRQ, and ABIM to improve chronic kidney disease education for those who must engage and practice it. Timely consultation by the nephrologist in chronic kidney disease promotes improved clinical outcomes and reduces the total cost of care for the patient and the public. It has been estimated that healthcare savings of 18. 5 to 60. 6 billion would accrue by reducing the chronic kidney disease progression rate by 1030% over the next decade. The optimal time for consultation is during chronic kidney disease Stages 34. As estimated glomerular filtration rate falls below 45 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 (chronic kidney disease Stage 3B), there is a significant increase in cardiovascular disease risk. Crossing this estimated glomerular filtration rate threshold is equivalent to experiencing a major cardiovascular event. This risk is worsened at any chronic kidney disease stage by the presence of persistent proteinuria. Estimating the glomerular filtration rate is important because this process not only optimizes the time of referral, but also delineates the progression rate of chronic kidney disease. Urinary abnormalities, electrolyte imbalances, uncontrolled hypertension, or metabolic abnormalities constitute reasons to initiate nephrological consultation. Certain conditions such as malignancy, dementia, multiple comorbidities, or an advanced directive may preclude referral to a nephrologist.",

Nicholas Diabetic kidney disease (diabetic kidney disease) refers to renal disease specific to diabetes that may be biopsyproven. This term may supplant diabetic nephropathy or diabetic chronic kidney disease and is the terminology used by the National Kidney Foundation. Introduction The worldwide prevalence of diabetes mellitus (diabetes mellitus) is expected to be 366 million by the year 2030, more than 2 times that from the year 2000. In the United States, 23. 6 million people have diabetes mellitus and another 57 million have pre-diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, and, in general, diabetes mellitus is linked primarily to obesity, aging, tobacco use, physical inactivity, and urbanization. diabetes mellitus accounts for 50% of prevalent and 40% of ultrasound incident end-stage renal disease (end-stage renal disease) ( renal disease), and diabetic end-stage renal disease is significantly higher in certain ethnic and racial populations (eg, African American, Mexican American, American Indian, Inuit, Hispanic). However, the majority of people with diabetes mellitus are more than 64 y. o. It is well known that diabetic end-stage renal disease is associated with excess morbidity and mortality. In a prospective German study, the 5-yr survival rate was 10% in elderly type 2 diabetics and 40% in the younger type 1 cohort. The elderly, including patients (cid: 1)75 yr, are less likely to survive long enough to receive a deceased donor kidney transplant compared with non-diabetic patients. Natural History, Diagnosis, and Screening of diabetic kidney disease The natural history of diabetic kidney disease has been attenuated by the advent of agents that block the renin angiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS). However, if left untreated, there is progression through phases of asymptomatic mesangial extracellular matrix accumulation, microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, and finally, overt proteinuric nephropathy. This sequence occurs more frequently in genetically predisposed individuals. During the asymptomatic phase, glomerular hyperfiltration occurs with mesangial scarring. Later, in types 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, the annual rate of glomerular filtration rate decline accelerates during the proteinuric phases: 1. 23. 6 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2/yr with microalbuminuria and up to 5. 412 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2/yr in overt nephropathy. Due to the hyperglycemia-induced accumulation of matrix, diabetic kidneys are frequently normally sized when examined by ultrasound (normal: 1012 cm).",

    "text": "Due to the hyperglycemia-induced accumulation of matrix, diabetic kidneys are frequently normally sized when examined by ultrasound (normal: 1012 cm). Hypertension (hypertension) occurs in 80% of adult diabetics, and a lack of nocturnal blood pressure dipping may precede the microalbuminuric phase, with clear-cut hypertension developing during the macro-albuminuric phase. Importantly, hypertension may be present in 70% of patients initiating dialysis for end-stage renal disease due to diabetic kidney disease. Microvascular disease is much more prevalent in type 1 diabetic kidney disease than in type 2 diabetic kidney disease. Specifically, retinopathy marked by the development of new retinal vessels is present in almost all type 1 diabetic kidney disease and 60% of type 2 diabetic kidney disease. Therefore, the absence of retinopathy or the presence of small kidneys by ultrasound in the latter group should prompt a search for a different etiology of chronic kidney disease since other primary renal disorders such as focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis and minimal change disease, among others, may exist in patients with diabetes mellitus. In addition, IgA nephropathy, and membranous nephropathy may co-exist with diabetic kidney disease. In some series, diabetic nephropathy may be accompanied by another non-hypertension-related kidney disorder in 515% of cases. In the United States, it is estimated that 50% of diabetic patients will develop diabetic kidney disease. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, there is an incidence of 3%/yr for the development of nephropathy (overt proteinuria) after 1020 yr of poorly controlled disease. In general, the key markers of chronic kidney disease are increased urine albuminto-creatinine ratio (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio) and increased serum creatinine estimates of glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate), 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2, 15 from 2 abnormal readings at least 3 months apart. Microalbuminuria (30300 magnesium/24 h; urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 3-30 magnesium/g) is the earliest clinical sign of diabetic kidney disease and is typically present in 2030% of type 1 diabetics 15 yr after the onset of diabetes mellitus. Progression to macroalbuminuria (300 magnesium/24 h; urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30 magnesium/g) is associated with increased progression of chronic kidney disease and possibly, end-stage renal disease. The level of proteinuria 2g/24-h may be identified qualitatively by (cid: 1)3 urine dipstick or followed quantitatively by the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPC; normal 0. 2 g/g), or a 24-h urine collection. The 24-h urine protein is considered the gold standard of urine protein determination as protein excretion may vary with the circadian rhythm, particularly in patients with glomerular disease. Afternoon (after 1600 h) UPC testing may significantly underestimate the morning UPC or 24-h urine protein. Proteinuria 3. 5g/24-h is considered nephrotic range proteinuria. A spot morning (08001200 hours) UPC has been shown to correlate well with the 24-h urine collection in patients with diabetic kidney disease, and therefore is also a good screening test for diabetic kidney disease and for monitoring patients on a stable treatment regimen. Benign proteinuria that occurs due to fever, intense exercise, postural changes, volume depletion, or acute illnesses should be reevaluated during stable conditions. The typical annual rates of progression of diabetic kidney disease from the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus to microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, and then to advanced chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease are 2. 0%, 2. 8%, and 2. 3%, respectively. diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria represent independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In addition, nearly 7080% of diabetic chronic kidney disease patients are hypertensive.",

    "text": "In addition, nearly 7080% of diabetic chronic kidney disease patients are hypertensive. Thus, routine screening for diabetic kidney disease is recommended for diabetic patients as follows: a) annual testing of urinary albumin excretion by spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate in type 1 diabetic patients with (cid: 1)5 yr duration of diabetes mellitus and b) annual testing of all type 2 diabetic patients from the time of diagnosis. Because several factors may cause transient increases in microalbuminuria, the diagnosis requires at least 2 serial first-morning urine specimens over 23 weeks. Occasionally, proteinuria in diabetes mellitus may herald other possible causes of chronic kidney disease, particularly glomerular disorders as described above. Suspect other causes when one or more of the following is present: a) absence of diabetic retinopathy or neuropathy b) presence of low or rapidly decreasing glomerular filtration rate c) presence of rapidly increasing proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome d) refractory hypertension e) active (blood and protein) urinary sediment f) manifestations of other systemic disease g) presence of 30% reduction in glomerular filtration rate within 23 months of the initiation of anti-reninangiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS) therapy. The rate of improvement in renal function following this initial expected physiologic decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate will depend on several patient-related factors, such as disease severity and ethnicity. For example, African Americans typically display earlier and more rapid declines in renal function. The presence of one or more of these clinical scenarios should prompt urgent patient referral to a nephrologist for confirmatory and/or additional diagnoses. Clinical remission of renal disease has taken place when proteinuria declines to 1 g/24-h, and regression is defined by a decline in proteinuria to 0. 3 g/24-h. 16 Treatment Considerations Due to increased cardiovascular disease risk in diabetic patients, prompt treatment of diabetic kidney disease and other CV risk factors is critical. Therefore, treatment of diabetic kidney disease toward therapeutic targets (eg, hemoglobin hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, lipids, body mass index) involves risk factor reduction to prevent diabetic kidney disease progression and a multimodal approach that addresses lifestyle modification. Such modifications include a DASH (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension), restricted dietary sodium intake at 1. 5 g/24 h, smoking cessation, restricted dietary intake of saturated fat and cholesterol (200 magnesium/24-h), and regular aerobic exercise. Spontaneous remission of microalbuminuria may occur in some patients with types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus. This may be attributable to improved blood pressure control and/or glycemic control. The strongest predictors of progressive diabetic kidney disease are the presence of poor glycemic control, hypertension, and glomerular hyperfiltration. Importantly, as diabetic kidney disease progresses, the requirements for insulin to maintain glycemic control diminish as renal metabolism and excretion of insulin concomitantly and progressively decreases. A reduction in insulin and/or other antihyperglycemiant medications (not metformin) may be required to prevent hypoglycemia. Thus, the three mainstays of optimal diabetic kidney disease treatment are: a) strict glycemic control b) tight blood pressure control c) maximal proteinuria reduction with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, singly or in combination. There are multiple, well-conducted clinical studies which indicate that these strategies retard the progression of diabetic kidney disease. The non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, diltiazem and verapamil) are anti-proteinuric and may potentiate the anti-proteinuric effects of anti-RAAS treatment(s). Even greater inhibition of the RAAS by the addition of a direct renin inhibitor (eg, aliskiren) or an aldosterone receptor antagonist (eg, aldosterone or eplerenone) may achieve improved anti-proteinuric effects. New research has uncovered an antioxidant drug, bardoxolone methyl that induces genes that suppress inflammatory mediators as a potential anti-proteinuric agent in the treatment of diabetic kidney disease.",

Aging and obesity are the two most important reasons behind this increasing prevalence. Hypertension frequently accompanies advancing chronic kidney disease, and it is often improperly assumed as the cause rather than the effect of chronic kidney disease. In fact, more patients develop hypertension from chronic kidney disease than develop chronic kidney disease from hypertension, ie, hypertensive nephrosclerosis. In one observational study, chronic kidney disease and hypertension increased the risk of stroke by 22% compared to equally hypertensive individuals without chronic kidney disease. By contrast, there was more than a 2-fold increase in stroke risk when the SBP was 120 mmHg. Further, in chronic kidney disease, heart failure and cardiovascular deaths increased as SBP approached 120 mmHg and below this threshold (J curve relationship). At-Risk Groups African Americans develop hypertensive chronic kidney disease (nephrosclerosis) much more frequently than Caucasians. Genetic susceptibility to hypertensive nephropathy associated with genetic polymorphisms (eg, APOL1, MYH9) in African Americans may contribute to this risk. In addition, hypertensive kidney disease in African Americans may not always be attributable to high blood pressure and may reflect an underlying glomerular disorder. Suspect these in non-diabetic individuals diagnosed with hypertensive nephropathy when their UPCs are 1 or UACRs are 300 magnesium/g. African Americans also tend to respond less well than Caucasian patients to monotherapy with beta blockers (BBs), ACEIs (angiotensin-convertingenzyme inhibitors) and/or ARBs (angiotensinreceptor blockers). However, ethnicity-related differences in therapeutic response are usually nullified by concomitant diuretic therapy.",

    "text": "However, ethnicity-related differences in therapeutic response are usually nullified by concomitant diuretic therapy. For example, the response to combined thiazide diuretic-angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker therapy is equivalent among the various ethnicities. Therefore, no particular agent should be avoided in patients of African American ethnicity. Since non-diabetic chronic kidney disease patients have equivalent or greater risk for the development of cardiovascular disease as diabetic patients without chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular protective measures in addition to antihypertensive therapy must always be considered. Since a given individuals blood pressure response to high sodium intake (salt sensitivity) is not predictable, sodium restriction should generally be enforced in all chronic kidney disease patients, ie, 1500 magnesium sodium (65 mEq sodium) per day. Blood Pressure Profile Hypertension in chronic kidney disease is considered by default as resistant hypertension, ie, treatment requires 3 or more antihypertensive agents at maximally tolerated doses and one of which must be a diuretic. The typical blood pressure profile is a SBP greatly exceeding DBP, manifested as an elevated pulse pressure (55 mmHg). Either the SBP or pulse pressure may be increased in hypervolemic/edematous individuals who must often be treated with diuretics. Proteinuria Evaluation for and quantitation of albuminuria/proteinuria is recommended when there is a family history of chronic kidney disease or the estimated glomerular filtration rate is 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2. Achievement of target blood pressure goals, particularly for the more important systolic pressure, will require two or more antihypertensive medications in most cases, if the initial SBP is (cid: 1)150 mmHg, two antihypertensive agents should be initiated, an anti-reninangiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS) drug such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and either a diuretic (eg, thiazide or loop diuretic, the latter predicated by the glomerular filtration rate) or calcium channel blocker (calcium channel blocker). Lastly, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (NDHPCCBs: diltiazem, 19 verapamil) are preferred in proteinuric chronic kidney disease, with appropriate caution during concomitant beta blocker therapy, or with contraindication due to bradycardia. Proteinuria accelerates the rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive, diabetic, and non-diabetic individuals. Hypertension exacerbates proteinuria and promotes tubulointerstitial inflammation, fibrosis, and tubular atrophy, further elevating blood pressure. Also, proteinuria, more specifically, albuminuria is an independent risk factor for stroke, LVH, and death. In the presence of 12 g/d proteinuria, the risk for progressive chronic kidney disease rises steeply after SBP (cid: 2)130 mmHg. All of the antireninangiotensinaldosterone system (anti-RAAS) agents are anti-fibrogenic, including aldosterone receptor antagonists (ARAs). Patients with a SBP of 115130 mmHg and proteinuria 1 g/d have a relatively lower risk of progression. However, a SBP of 120130 mmHg may be considered optimal for patients with hypertension and proteinuria since SBPs (cid: 1)120 have been associated with an enhanced risk of adverse cardiovascular events in proteinuric chronic kidney disease patients, particularly those with stroke or heart failure. Treatment The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC 7) issued a set of Compelling Indications (see TABLE) for the treatment of hypertension, which should also be followed in chronic kidney disease patients. Modification of lifestyle and dietary interventions should always be enforced in hypertensive chronic kidney disease patients. Sodium restriction can produce substantial blood pressure reductions, and primarily entails reducing the intake of salty processed foods. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support a SBP goal 130 mmHg in chronic kidney disease with urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 0. 22. In patients with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria that is 1 g/d, a SBP of 120130 mmHg is recommended.",

Elevated albuminuria/proteinuria portends worsening chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease risk, particularly in diabetic, hypertensive and patients with glomerular disorders. The prevalence of proteinuria is 48% worldwide and 1020% in hypertensive, obese, and/or diabetic populations. Diabetics and persons with eGFRs 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 should undergo proteinuria testing. Individuals with higher eGFRs should only undergo proteinuria evaluation(s), if there is a strong suspicion for chronic kidney disease (ie, strong family history of chronic kidney disease or other renally associated condition). Proteinuria must be quantified in chronic kidney disease patients by UPC (urine protein-to-creatinine) ratio or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio; also termed albumin-creatinine ratio). Using urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio more reliably classifies individuals with higher risk chronic kidney disease (ie, those who might develop progressive disease) who have been stratified into chronic kidney disease Stages 3 and 4 by the MDRD 4variable estimated glomerular filtration rate equation. Using the combination of estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 and proteinuria by urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio reduces the prevalence of chronic kidney disease Stages 3 and 4 patients by 76%, from 16. 3 million to 3. 9 million. Note that UPC testing is not nationally standardized due to variation in laboratory methodology; however, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio testing is standardized. The presence of even small amounts of albuminuria (10 magnesium/g) is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. While angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (angiotensin-convertingenzyme inhibitor) and/or angiotensin receptor blocker (angiotensin-receptor blocker) therapies reduce albuminuria and are associated with reduced risk for developing end-stage renal disease (especially in diabetes and hypertension), they are underutilized. Ideally, 70% or more of patients should be treated with these drugs. Types of Proteinuria Traditionally, normal urinary protein excretion is considered to be 150 magnesium/24-h; total urinary proteins measured are comprised of immunoglobulins, assorted globulins, and Tamm-Horsfall mucoprotein. Persistently elevated total urinary protein signifies: a) defect(s) in the glomerular basement membrane b) impaired tubular protein reabsorption, eg, tubulointerstitial nephritis c) increased filtration of low molecular weight protein(s), ie, overflow proteinuria as may occur with light chains.",

    "text": "Persistent proteinuria is defined as two or more positive quantitative tests of protein excretion, separated by at least 2 weeks. Common, benign sources of albuminuria/proteinuria include orthostatic proteinuria, intense activity/exercise, and fever. Serious causes of proteinuria include glomerular disorders and myeloma. False positive albuminuria results by urine dipstick include highly alkaline urine, concentrated urine, gross hematuria and the presence of mucus, semen or white cells. Individuals at increased risk for chronic kidney disease should undergo testing for proteinuria. The urinalysis dipstick may not register proteinuria when the urine is highly dilute, (ie, specific gravity (cid: 1)1. 015). In addition, the dipstick preferentially detects albumin, which is the major urinary protein excreted in proteinuric chronic kidney disease disorders, eg, diabetes, glomerular disorders. 24 Evaluation of Proteinuria Early or first morning spot UPC ratio (urine protein and urine creatinine expressed as milligrams per deciliter) correlates with the daily protein excretion rate (g/24-h). A UPC 2 correlates with 2 g of proteinuria per 24-h and approximates the 24-h urine total protein collection, a collection fraught with error(s). Since the majority of protein excretion in glomerular disease is albumin, albuminspecific tests have been devised, eg, albumin-specific dipsticks and the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, traditionally classified as normal (30 magnesium/g), microalbuminuria (30300 magnesium/g) and macroalbuminuria (300 magnesium/g). Notably, a new classification system that eschews the terms microand macroalbuminuria may be established in the near future. Quantitative urinary protein (principally albuminuria) testing by UPC or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is recommended within 3 months of documentation of (cid: 1)1 proteinuria by dipstick analysis. Two or more positive quantitative tests, preferably on first morning urine specimens, should be documented before diagnosing persistent proteinuria (see chronic kidney disease PROTEINURIA EVALUATION, P. 27). The urine dipstick favors albumin detection and is relatively insensitive for tubular proteinuria, eg, immunoglobulin light chains. If tubular proteinuria is suspected, specific qualitative and quantitative examinations may be required, eg, serum free light chain analysis (Freelite) and serum and urine immunofixation. For screening purposes, a 24-h urine is unnecessary, but if a serum monoclonal protein is detected, a 24-h urine collection for immunofixation is indicated. Consultation with a clinical laboratory expert is advised to optimize diagnostic yield in such cases. Anti-Proteinuric Therapy Anti-proteinuric therapy reduces tubulointerstitial fibrosis and thus, progression of chronic kidney disease. Patients with stable, persistent proteinuria of 1 g/24-h have a very small risk of progression to kidney failure compared to individuals with greater proteinuria. However, glomerular proteinuria in the nephrotic range (2 g/m2/d; 3. 03. 5 g/24-h in adults) has an ominous prognosis and is associated with edema, hypercholesterolemia, hypoalbuminemia, anemia, lipiduria, vitamin D deficiency, and greater risk for progression to end-stage renal disease. Irrespective of the degree of proteinuria, all therapies that reduce proteinuria should be optimized for blood pressure control of 130/80 mmHg as tolerated. Anti-renin angiotensinaldosterone (RAAS) agents, ACEIs and ARBs, represent first-line anti-proteinuric drugs and should be utilized whenever possible. These agents are indicated in the treatment of diabetic and non-diabetic proteinuric chronic kidney disease. Antihypertensive regimens that include anti-RAAS therapy are more efficacious than regimens that do not include ACEIs or ARBs, and their benefit is maximized in chronic kidney disease patients that manifest either 0. 5 g/d of proteinuria, UPCs 0. 22, or microalbuminuria by urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. The anti-RAAS therapies exert differential, beneficial effects on glomerular structural proteins, intraglomerular pressures, local and systemic sympathetic nervous systems, inflammatory pathways, and the systemic blood pressure. Notably, no specific agent reduces tubular proteinuria. Recently, aldosterone receptor antagonists (ARAs) and direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) have demonstrated anti-proteinuric properties.",

    "text": "Recently, aldosterone receptor antagonists (ARAs) and direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) have demonstrated anti-proteinuric properties. Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (calcium channel blockers), diltiazem and verapamil, also reduce proteinuria and complement the anti-RAAS agents. Combinations of such agents (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker) frequently reduce proteinuria by an additional 25 40%. However, dual-agent anti-RAAS therapies involving ACEIs or ARBs (VA NEPHRON-D) with other antiproteinuric agents, eg, (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker) ARA or (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker) DRI (ALTITUDE) should be initiated and monitored by a nephrologist. The goal of attaining target blood pressure supersedes additional use of antiproteinuric agents. Recent data suggest that pentoxifylline and HMG-Co synthetase inhibitors, simvastatin and atorvastatin, may reduce proteinuria. 25 Finally, high sodium intake and poor glycemic control may retard blood pressure-lowering and proteinuriareducing effects of antihypertensive agents. Sodium intake of (cid: 1)1500 magnesium daily is recommended for patients with chronic kidney disease. Therapeutic Targets for Proteinuria Reduction UPC 0. 2 (dimensionless ratio; units as milligrams per deciliter) UPC 200 magnesium/g (protein as milligrams per deciliter; creatinine as grams per deciliter) urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30 magnesium/g First-line Agents for Proteinuria Reduction Non-diabetic proteinuria angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (angiotensin receptor blocker, if angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-intolerant) Diabetes, type 1 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (angiotensin receptor blocker, if angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-intolerant) Diabetes, type 2 angiotensin receptor blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor Second-line Agents for Proteinuria Reduction Diabetes, types 1 or 2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker) calcium channel blocker COMMENTS Repeat quantitation of proteinuria by a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio or a UPC at 812 wk intervals after therapeutic interventions that aim to reduce proteinuria to minimize urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio or UPC. 24-h urine protein collections are rarely required for proteinuria evaluations as spot UPCs are usually sufficient. False-positive UA dipstick protein reactions may result from alkaline urine (pH 7), gross hematuria, mucus, semen, leukocytes, radiocontrast, exogenous creatine supplementation, and contamination by certain cleansing solutions, eg, chlorhexidine or benzalkonium. Optimal timing of urine protein determination is the first morning void following recumbency, which should help rule out orthostatic proteinuria. UPC and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio tests may underestimate protein excretion in muscular patients, but may overestimate excretion in cachectic patients. REFERENCES 1. G Leoncini, et al.

In chronic kidney disease Stage 5, the ferritin target is 200 ng/mL. Anemia of chronic kidney disease usually begins during chronic kidney disease Stage 3, ie, GFRs 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2. Anemia occurs in 42%, 54% and 76% of chronic kidney disease Stage 3, 4 and 5 patients, respectively, and is more severe in diabetics. Anemia multiplies the mortality risks of diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. Treatment of anemia of chronic kidney disease is associated with improved vitality and socialization, but has not been shown to decrease LVH or cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Iron deficiency should be corrected before administration of any erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (erythropoiesis stimulating agent). The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ANEMIA IN CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE: 2007 UPDATE OF HEMOGLOBIN TARGET states a Clinical Practice Recommendation for a hemoglobin target of 11. 0 to 12. 0 grams per deciliter and a top-level hemoglobin of 13. 0 grams per deciliter in chronic kidney disease. To obtain reimbursement for erythropoiesis-stimulating agent therapy, the hemoglobin must be 10 grams per deciliter on the date that an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent is first prescribed, and reimbursement is dependent upon payors coverage policies. Lastly, an attestation of medical necessity for erythropoiesis-stimulating agent treatment may be required for reimbursement by third party payors. Pathophysiology The primary reason for anemia in chronic kidney disease is an absolute or relative deficiency of renal erythropoietin (erythropoietin) synthesis. Individual sensitivity and responsiveness to an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent is highly variable and dosing requirements are heterogeneous. Occult causes of blood loss and iron deficiency must be ruled out in all patients as a cause of hyporesponsivenss to erythropoiesis-stimulating agent treatment. Less commonly, vitamin deficiencies, eg, B and folate, and inflammatory causes of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent resistance should be ruled out 12 secondarily. Inflammation upregulates hepcidin, a liver-synthesized protein that reduces gut iron absorption and impedes iron release from the reticuloendothelial system to the developing erythron. Finally, effective iron delivery is required for optimal erythropoiesis-stimulating agent-stimulated production of fully hemoglobinized red blood cells. Iron Deficiency Iron deficiency is common in chronic kidney disease. chronic kidney disease patients should be iron replete before initiating ESAs. To correct iron deficiency, oral iron should always be tried initially, and multiple iron salt preparations are available. However, to achieve iron repletion, parenteral iron may be required in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients. Multiple studies attest to the safety of several parenteral iron preparations, including iron sucrose FDA-approved, ferumoxytol FDA-approved, and low molecular weight iron dextran used off label. 28 Safety During anemia treatment, hemoglobin elevations of 12 grams per deciliter per month are generally well tolerated. More rapid increments are not advised. Recent clinical trials describe an increased risk of blood clots, strokes, and heart attacks in chronic kidney disease and dialysis patients, in association with treatment to hemoglobin levels of 13 grams per deciliter, particularly at high doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent. FDA and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent manufacturers have agreed to revised product labelings that include a black box warning with an FDA-approved target hemoglobin of 1012 grams per deciliter (see below). However, the heterogeneity of responses to erythropoiesis-stimulating agent/iron-based anemia therapy among patients and even over time in the same patient makes the targeting of an exact hemoglobin difficult. Lastly, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent dosing has been extended to once monthly intervals in several clinical trials.",

In hemodialysis patients, administration of vitamin D may reduce erythropoiesis-stimulating agent utilization. 29 COMMENTS Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) should be co-administered with iron in achlorhydric patients (250 magnesium per iron tablet), during H antagonist or proton pump inhibitor therapy, or after gastric ulcer surgery (eg, 2 Billroth II surgery). calcium-based P-binders bind iron salts. Consult a nephrologist before initiating erythropoiesis-stimulating agent treatment, if oral iron therapy does not achieve hemoglobin (cid: 1)10 grams per deciliter or if parenteral iron is considered. Dose conversion ratio of epoetin alfa to darbepoetin alfa is 225260 to 1. erythropoietin levels should not be measured as part of a routine anemia evaluation. ESAs are contraindicated during acute blood loss. Iron salts should only be ingested on an empty stomach. Iron salts bind fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, calcium-based P-binders, and levothyroxine. Administer thyroid hormones separately from iron. Parenteral iron is contraindicated during active infection. REFERENCES 1. A Besarab, et al. J Am Soc Nephrol 10: 2029, 1999 2. T Ganz.

J Nephrol (in press) 30 chronic kidney disease-MINERAL AND BONE DISORDER by L. Tammy Ho Introduction Renal osteodystrophy (renal osteodystrophy) defines the presence of altered bone structure and composition in chronic kidney disease and is but one aspect of chronic kidney disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder), a multi-system disease entity involving abnormalities of mineral metabolism, renal osteodystrophy, and extraskeletal calcification. The understanding of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder as a systemic disorder is evolving and emphasizes monitoring and interventions to correct alterations in calcium (serum calcium), P (serum phosphorus), parathyroid hormone (parathyroid hormone), and vitamin D. No single procedure or test establishes the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder. Data indicate that chronic kidney disease-related bone loss is associated with extraskeletal calcification and may contribute to the excessive cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality of chronic kidney disease. Calcification occurs most frequently in coronary arteries, aorta, and cardiac valvular leaflets. Initial evaluation of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder includes assessing and establishing baseline calcium, P, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D as 25(OH)D, alkaline phosphatase, and serum HCO levels. 3 Bone Disorders The TMV (turnover/remodeling, mineralization, and volume) classification of renal osteodystrophy relies on bone histology from transiliac biopsy and has 4 subtypes that may overlap: osteomalacia, adynamic bone disease, osteitis fibrosa, and mixed uremic osteodystrophy (see TABLE). Historically, the most common lesion was secondary hyperparathyroidism (secondary hyperparathyroidism), and this is still the most prevalent lesion in non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease. However, therapeutic interventions have increased the prevalence of adynamic bone disease. Osteoporosis in chronic kidney disease, as defined by WHO criteria for non-chronic kidney disease patients, is difficult to diagnose, especially in late chronic kidney disease stages. Bone densitometry, commonly used in the general population, provides no information on bone quality or turnover, and these are frequently abnormal in progressive chronic kidney disease. Nonetheless, bone loss should be monitored periodically. Lastly, metabolic acidosis (HCO 3 22 milliequivalents per liter) increases net bone resorption (osteoclasts) and reduces calcitriol synthesis and should be corrected.

Ionized calcium regulates the parathyroid gland (PTG) calcium-sensing receptor (CaR), vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone. Low ionized calcium levels reduce CaR stimulation and increase parathyroid hormone secretion, elevating ionized calcium and renal P excretion and calcitriol synthesis. An average daily dietary P intake is 8001400 magnesium, 80% of which is renally excreted via parathyroid hormone action. In an individual with normal renal function, low P stimulates calcitriol independently leading to decreased parathyroid hormone and increased gut absorption of P. Progressive chronic kidney disease leads to progressive elevation in P; low P levels in a patient with significant chronic kidney disease should lead to consideration of other additional underlying issues such as malnutrition. High P levels raise parathyroid hormone and are associated with greater cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.",

    "text": "High P levels raise parathyroid hormone and are associated with greater cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. The traditional thought has been that increased P is one inciting factor in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism and chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder, and goals of therapy have debated the maintenance of a 31 normal P range versus reduction to the normal range. Dietary P restriction is beneficial in early chronic kidney disease, and renal dietary consultation may be sought at any chronic kidney disease Stage. As chronic kidney disease progresses, diet alone is likely to be an ineffective intervention to prevent or correct hyperphosphatemia. Currently, P binders remain a mainstay of therapy in patients with elevated levels. secondary hyperparathyroidism may develop in late chronic kidney disease Stage 2. parathyroid hormone levels are elevated in nearly one-third of chronic kidney disease Stage 3 patients and may be increased despite normal calcium and P levels. Vitamin D as 25(OH)D deficiency is frequent in chronic kidney disease and may further elevate parathyroid hormone. In chronic kidney disease Stage 4, hyperphosphatemia from renal P retention occurs. To prevent progressive PTG growth and parathyroid hormone secretion as chronic kidney disease worsens, screen for and begin treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism early. Please note the developing story of Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23). Bone-derived FGF23 is one of an undefined number of circulating peptides known as phosphatonins. FGF23 acts on kidney proximal tubular cells and decreases P reabsorption, thereby increasing urinary P excretion. FGF-23 apparently directly suppresses parathyroid hormone and decreases calcitriol synthesis by inhibiting proximal tubular 1α-OHase inhibition. FGF-23 is significantly elevated in chronic kidney disease and is the subject of much current research aimed at determining its significance as a chronic kidney disease biomarker or parameter of successful therapy, with other phosphatonins. Metabolic acidosis defined as a serum HCO 3 22 milliequivalents per liter that is not generated by respiratory alkalosis is under-recognized. Acidosis potentiates bone-lytic parathyroid hormone effects, thereby increasing calcium and P bone resorption. It also increases SNS activity, aggravating hypertension, induces insulin resistance, and promotes muscle-protein catabolism. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate generally does not produce ECF volume expansion (eg, edema) or worsen hypertension. If edema or blood pressure elevation occurs, loop diuretic therapy is recommended. Once established, the treatment of metabolic acidosis should always be initiated with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO) or another alkali. 3 CALCIUM, PHOSPHORUS, PARATHYROID HORMONE, AND VITAMIN D ACTIONS Compound Source/Distribution Action Bone mineralization, (cid: 1)Ionized calcium Diet, bone resorption CaR activation (cid: 1)CaR stimulation Kidney, PTG, other (cid: 2) secondary hyperparathyroidism, (cid: 2) PTG growth Diet, renal P retention, bone (cid: 1)P (cid: 1) parathyroid hormone, complexes calcium, (cid: 1)FGF23 resorption (cid: 1) ionized calcium, (cid: 1) P excretion (cid: 1)parathyroid hormone PTG (cid: 1) calcitriol synthesis (cid: 1)parathyroid hormone receptor Bone (osteoblast), kidney See parathyroid hormone stimulation Endogenous synthesis; (cid: 2) secondary hyperparathyroidism, (cid: 1) gut calcium/P absorption (cid: 1)Vitamin D exogenous administration (cid: 1) kidney calcium absorption Bone, kidney, PTG, gut and other (cid: 1)VDR stimulation (cid: 2) parathyroid hormone gene activity tissues Abbreviations: CaR, calcium-sensing receptor; PTG, parathyroid gland; secondary hyperparathyroidism, secondary hyperparathyroidism; P, serum phosphorus; VDR, vitamin D receptor.

Currently, 25(OH)D levels 30 ng/mL represent vitamin D insufficiency. However, these agents may not sufficiently suppress parathyroid hormone elevations in chronic kidney disease Stages 35, despite replenishing vitamin D stores. Consequently, active vitamin D sterols may be required to suppress parathyroid hormone to target levels. Any of these compounds can be used concomitantly with vitamin D2 or D3. Oral vitamin D is recommended in chronic kidney disease Stages 3 and 4, and active vitamin D sterols are recommended to prevent and treat early secondary hyperparathyroidism and chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder. Treatment (with active vitamin D sterols) is indicated when 25(OH)D levels are 30 ng/mL; Corrected calcium (Corr calcium) is 9. 5 milligrams per deciliter; P 4. 6 milligrams per deciliter; and parathyroid hormone levels are elevated and continue to rise with time. The optimal parathyroid hormone levels in chronic kidney disease are unknown and likely vary with a number of factors, not limited to stage of chronic kidney disease and race. An intact parathyroid hormone range that is 29 (cid: 1) ULN (130600 pg/mL) may be acceptable, with the growing acceptance that therapy of mineral metabolism should be individualized, ie, trend analysis of the above parameters is favored over absolute values. Corr calcium (milligrams per deciliter) Total serum calcium 0. 8 (4 Albumin) Doxercalciferol, a vitamin D2 prohormone, requires hepatic hydroxylation for activation. Paricalcitol, a calcitriol analog, is active upon administration and does not require in vivo activation. Doxercalciferol and paricalcitol exert vitamin D-like actions and are less prone to induce hypercalcemia than calcitriol. calcium-based P-binders are recommended in chronic kidney disease Stages 3 and 4 for P 4. 6 milligrams per deciliter when the corrected calcium is 10. 2 milligrams per deciliter and there is no evidence of coronary, peripheral vascular/cardiac valvular calcification. During calcium-based P-binder therapy, the total daily elemental calcium intake (dietary prescribed) should not exceed 2000 magnesium daily. This limit is imposed to prevent excessive calcium loading and extraskeletal calcification and dystrophic medial arterial calcification that occur earlier 33 in diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Sevelamer hydrochloride, a non-metal anion exchange resin, and lanthanum carbonate are non-calcium-based P-binders. These agents may be used as initial P-binder therapy, if arterial/cardiac vascular calcification is present or, if the corrected calcium is 10. 2 milligrams per deciliter. These drugs do not alter calcium or parathyroid hormone levels and do not affect treatment by vitamin D or its analogs. Sevelamer typically reduces LDL-C by 30% and raises HDL-C. Lastly, the calcium (cid: 2) P product as a therapeutic parameter is no longer used.",

Hypercholesterolemia, obesity and cigarette smoking have been shown to negatively influence chronic kidney disease outcomes. Moreover, some HMG-CoA synthetase inhibitors (statins) have recently been associated with slowing the decline of kidney function in chronic kidney disease and a reduction in proteinuria. Despite these observations, dyslipidemia therapy in chronic kidney disease has been suboptimal. Most of the knowledge regarding lipids in chronic kidney disease is based on studies of hemodialysis patients and has been extrapolated to earlier stages.

    "text": "Lipid Levels chronic kidney disease dysregulates normal triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol (C) metabolism. High TG (triglyceride) levels stem from reduced endothelial lipoprotein lipase activity and lipoprotein abnormalities that reduce receptor binding and lipoprotein uptake, with apoC-III-enriched lipids. Other metabolic defects result in increased VLDL remnants (IDL) and ApoB-rich lipids (eg, LDLC). These defects combine with lowered HDL-C levels (low apoA-1 and II) to generate a highly atherogenic profile, with elevated Lp(a). In end-stage renal disease, LDL-C 130 milligrams per deciliter are present in 1045% of non-nephrotic patients and TG levels are 200 milligrams per deciliter in 4050% of these individuals. Importantly, non-HDL-C Total-C HDL-C, which reflects serum TGs, correlates best with overall cardiovascular disease risk in chronic kidney disease and does not require assessment in the fasted state. Nephrotic range proteinuria stimulates LDL-C synthesis, and high LDL-C may be the dominant abnormality. Lipid-Lowering Benefits chronic kidney disease clinical practice recommendations for lipid-lowering therapy in chronic kidney disease are less evidencebased than NCEP ATP III guidelines due to a lack of large randomized, controlled trials. Two large trials (4D and AURORA) in end-stage renal disease patients demonstrated no cardiovascular or mortality benefits. A recent large, randomized controlled trial (SHARP) of chronic kidney disease patients treated by simvastatin/ezetimibe demonstrated a positive effect of LDL-Clowering therapy in non-dialysisdependent chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 27 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2) and end-stage renal disease patients. Major atherosclerotic events (combination of non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary death, ischemic stroke, or any revascularization event) were reduced by 17% compared to placebo. There was no effect on reducing the progression of chronic kidney disease. Lipid-Lowering Strategies Lipid-lowering therapy in chronic kidney disease is recommended, if TGs 200 milligrams per deciliter and/or LDL-C 100 milligrams per deciliter after 3 months of therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC). Lipid evaluation should be conducted at initial evaluation, 23 months after treatment changes, and at least, annually afterward. Treatment goals are equivalent to ATP III criteria for CHD and/or diabetes. LDL-C should be lowered to 100 milligrams per deciliter, with an optional, more aggressive goal of 70 milligrams per deciliter. Statins are first-line therapy in chronic kidney disease patients with elevated LDL-C, but there is no preferred agent. Ezetimibe may be added to statin therapy. Bile acid sequestrants and niacin may be used, if statins cannot be used. Lastly, the target for combined dyslipidemia in chronic kidney disease (TGs 200 milligrams per deciliter; non-HDL-C (cid: 1)130 milligrams per deciliter) is a nonHDL-C 130 milligrams per deciliter (see chronic kidney disease DYSLIPIDEMIA TREATMENT). Gemfibrozil is considered the fibric acid derivative (fibrates) of choice for chronic kidney disease patients with elevated TGs. Fibrates must be administered cautiously with statins in chronic kidney disease to avoid hepatic toxicity or myopathy. However, there is no evidence that statins induce a greater incidence of rhabdomyolysis in chronic kidney disease patients, compared to the general population. Muscle pain from statin therapy is genetically predisposed and is not an effect of chronic kidney disease. 40 Therapeutic Targets TG 150 milligrams per deciliter LDL-C 70100 milligrams per deciliter (diabetes: optional goal is 70 milligrams per deciliter) Non-HDL-C (cid: 1)130 milligrams per deciliter ( Total-C HDL-C) Evaluation TG, LDL-C Every 23 mo until treatment goal achieved, then every 612 mo Non-HDL-C Every 23 mo until treatment goal achieved, then every 612 mo Treatment Statin Dose that reduces LDL-C to (cid: 1)70100 milligrams per deciliter Gemfibrozil Limit to 300 magnesium twice daily for glomerular filtration rate 50 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 COMMENTS Baseline hepatic transaminase levels should be determined before initiating statin therapy, after 23 months of treatment and periodically afterward.",

Cristina Kilates Introduction Malnutrition evolves during the progression of chronic kidney disease with electrolyte abnormalities, muscle mass reduction, and depressed immunological function. These problems are compounded by anorexia that often accompanies advanced chronic kidney disease and poor food choice(s), ie, lack of high biological value protein. Hypoalbuminemia and related nutritional disorders, including vitamin and mineral deficiencies are common. Preventing malnutrition through periodic visits to a trained renal nutritionist for nutrition surveillance is recommended and may avert complications. Protein Intake High biological value protein intake should be maintained, while sodium, potassium, and phosphorus intake are restricted. Protein targets vary depending on chronic kidney disease Stage (see NUTRITIONAL TARGETS FOR chronic kidney disease). A controlled protein diet slows the decline of kidney function more than one with more liberal protein intake. Fluid restriction should only be instituted, if hyponatremia is present. The reduction of sodium and phosphate intake is much more important than restricting fluid intake, unless there is hyponatremia (S sodium 130 milliequivalents per liter). Monitoring A 24-h urine collection for sodium (goal 100 mEq sodium per 24-h), urea nitrogen and creatinine is highly informative regarding the level of compliance with a dietary prescription. To preserve lean body mass, a supervised exercise regimen should be considered in conjunction with dietary recommendations. Patients with high blood pressure are advised to follow a DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, which has proven efficacy. Modification of a DASH diet will be required in chronic kidney disease patients because of its high potassium and phosphate contents. Lastly, patients with proteinuria at any stage of chronic kidney disease should be referred to a Renal Dietitian/Nutritionist.

J Renal Nutr 20(1): e1, 2010 44 IMMUNIZATIONS IN CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE by Jerry Yee Introduction chronic kidney disease patients are immunocompromised in chronic kidney disease Stage 5 and end-stage renal disease; however, the degree of immunocompromise is less certain and documented in earlier stages. Nonetheless, chronic kidney disease patients are immunized less frequently against influenza virus and S. pneumoniae than the general population. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines may be co-administered. chronic kidney disease patients should receive the following immunizations: a) Trivalent, inactivated influenza A/B (TIV) vaccine b) 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal (Pneumovax, PPV23) vaccine c) Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine Hepatitis B Virus HBV vaccination is advised in patients with progressive chronic kidney disease, and immunization in chronic kidney disease Stage 4, pre-end-stage renal disease, is recommended because late Stage 5 vaccination produces lesser rates of seroconversion. In chronic kidney disease Stage 5, antigen presenting cell and CD4 cell defects occur. HBVantibody responses to HBV are less intense and less durable. Immunocompetence, measured by achievement of an antibody titer 10 mIU/mL, occurs in just 5070% of end-stage renal disease patients. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive patients can be safely immunized against HBV. Lastly, booster vaccinations with tetanus toxoid, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccines (Tdap) may be administered alone or co-administered with any of the vaccines listed below.

Nearly 43% of chronic kidney disease Stage5/end-stage renal disease patients have no pre-end-stage renal disease evaluation by a nephrologist and often begin KRT in-hospital via a hemodialysis (hemodialysis) catheter. In these cases, healthcare expenditures during the initial 3 months of end-stage renal disease therapy increase by an average of 30, 000 per patient. To prevent this untoward clinical scenario, advanced chronic kidney disease Stage 4 patients should be referred to a vascular access surgeon at estimated glomerular filtration rate 20 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 for timely planning of appropriate hemodialysis vascular access or peritoneal dialysis (peritoneal dialysis) catheter placement.",

    "text": "73 m2 for timely planning of appropriate hemodialysis vascular access or peritoneal dialysis (peritoneal dialysis) catheter placement. In the ultrasound, lack of timely (early) vascular access planning, type of medical care prior to onset of end-stage renal disease, and socioeconomic factors result in a disproportionately high proportion of patients beginning KRT with in-hospital hemodialysis via temporary, non-tunneled, non-cuffed hemodialysis catheters that are associated with significant and costly morbidity (infections, venous stenosis) and mortality. To offset this trend, in 1997 the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended earlier referral of chronic kidney disease patients to nephrologists to facilitate vascular access evaluation and construction to optimize clinical outcomes and costs. Timing of Kidney Replacement Therapy The decision to treat patients with chronic kidney disease by KRT as kidney transplantation, peritoneal dialysis, or hemodialysis should be made collaboratively by patients and their healthcare team. KRT is an expensive government entitlement program: minimum annual per patient cost, 36, 000; annual average cost 77, 000. Recent data reveal that starting KRT early does not increase patient survival. Although chronic kidney disease Stage 5 begins at estimated glomerular filtration rate 15 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2, KRT does not have to begin then, if the patient is well. The number of comorbidities that a patient has must be taken into consideration before initiating KRT. Patients 75 y. o. , particularly, if male, with multiple comorbidities managed conservatively fare just as well as those on dialysis because death versus dialysis is a competing survival risk. Therefore, conservative management, when chosen, focuses the shift from simply attempting to prolong life to providing quality of life and alleviation of symptoms. This includes optimization of all parameters associated with chronic kidney disease care (see CHECKLIST). Education An informed patient fares better than the non-informed one. chronic kidney disease education entails information of various kidney replacement therapies: transplantation, peritoneal dialysis, in-center hemodialysis, and home hemodialysis. Physical conditions such as vision and manual dexterity, motivational level to actively participate in care, and family/social circumstances all play roles in the decision-making process. chronic kidney disease educational materials are widely distributed over the Internet. Patient advocacy groups have authored numerous, helpful informational materials written at an appropriate reading level (see chronic kidney disease WEBSITES OF INTEREST). When adequately informed about end-stage renal disease modalities, 38% of chronic kidney disease Stage 5 patients choose peritoneal dialysis in comparison to 5% of patients who had not received more intensive end-stage renal diseasemodality training. The provision of dedicated chronic kidney disease education classes for patients and families, in conjunction with chronic kidney disease clinics, has resulted in improved clinical outcomes, particularly in end-stage renal disease-modality training, vascular access placement, blood pressure control, and anemia of chronic kidney disease. 48 Peritoneal Dialysis Peritoneal dialysis (peritoneal dialysis) is a viable option for most end-stage renal disease patients; however, it was chosen by just 10. 9% of end-stage renal disease patients who began end-stage renal disease care between 2005 and 2007. Peritoneal dialysis as a modality option was discussed with 61% of patients before initiation of dialysis. Instillation of a hypertonic glucose-containing solution via a trans-abdominal peritoneal dialysis catheter provides uremic solute (diffusion) and excess sodium and water removal (convection). peritoneal dialysis catheters should be implanted at least 4 weeks prior to the date of their anticipated use. blood pressure and P control are superior with peritoneal dialysis compared to conventional hemodialysis. peritoneal dialysis involves diffusion of uremic solutes and electrolytes from capillaries lining the peritoneal membranes into the externally infused dialysate.",

    "text": "peritoneal dialysis involves diffusion of uremic solutes and electrolytes from capillaries lining the peritoneal membranes into the externally infused dialysate. The continual nature of peritoneal dialysis is suited for heart failure patients and/or volume-dependent hypertension. Contraindications to peritoneal dialysis include extreme obesity, multiple abdominal surgeries, and recurrent peritonitis. Complications of peritoneal dialysis catheters include peritonitis, catheter malfunction, and failure of peritoneal dialysis due to membrane loss/fibrosis. Peritonitis can be treated with intra-peritoneal or iv antibiotics and may require catheter exchange. Catheter removal is absolutely indicated when pseudomonal, MRSA, or fungal peritonitis occurs. Hemodialysis About 92% of the incident dialysis patients in the United States undergo conventional hemodialysis, typically carried out thrice-weekly in a designated hemodialysis unit, ie, in-center dialysis, with typical treatment times of 34 h. Some centers offer nocturnal hemodialysis where patients sleep during treatment by slow, low-efficiency dialysis. Home hemodialysis is conducted in the home environment, 56 sessions weekly for 2. 53 h. Control of blood pressure and phosphorus are superior with peritoneal dialysis, nocturnal peritoneal dialysis, and home hemodialysis compared to conventional thrice-weekly hemodialysis. Optimal hemodialysis requires a well-functioning vascular access and this can be provided via an autogenous arteriovenous fistula (arteriovenous fistulas), bioprosthetic arteriovenous graft (arteriovenous grafts), or hemodialysis catheters. The arteriovenous fistula is the best hemodialysis vascular access and most closely satisfies the requirement for adequate blood flow delivery to the dialysis machine, and has the lowest maintenance cost among all vascular access types. Notably, the failure of access function limits the delivered dose of dialysis, a major survival determinant. Vascular Access Planning and Construction Key issues include timely nephrology referral; vein preservation; vascular access creation planning; timely referral to a surgeon specialized in access construction; post-construction followup; and appropriate intervention(s). Protection of superficial hand and forearm veins, particularly of the non-dominant arm, is critical in chronic kidney disease patients. The dorsum of the hand should be used for peripheral lines and blood draws. The patient should be evaluated by venous mapping, preferably by ultrasound duplex scanning of the non-dominant arm (non-hand writing); if unsuitable, the dominant arm may be used for access creation. The patient and healthcare workers must know the intended surgery site. Therefore, vein preservation during hospitalizations and outpatient care must occur. Subclavian vein catheter placement(s) and PICC lines are discouraged and are associated with high central vein stenosis rates, and their use may preclude access creation(s). Cardiac AICD and pacemaker placements should be contralateral to the planned vascular access arm. Educational programs reinforcing the above should be provided to patients, their families and healthcare providers. 49 Preparation of the hemodialysis patient includes surgical vascular access construction. An arteriovenous fistula, typically created from a native artery and vein in the distal non-dominant upper extremity, is the optimal hemodialysis vascular access. Placement of an arteriovenous fistula should precede the time of anticipated hemodialysis by 6 months, to ensure sufficient fistula maturation before hemodialysis needle cannulation. When arteriovenous fistula creation is not feasible, arteriovenous graft construction should proceed 36 weeks before anticipated hemodialysis. REFERENCES 1.

Am J Kidney Dis 56(6): 1032, 2010 50 MEDICATION-RELATED PROBLEMS by Carol Moore Introduction Potentially adverse complications of drugs or medication-related problems that commonly occur in chronic kidney disease are enumerated. Such adverse effects may occur in the context of acute kidney injury/acute renal failure or in chronic kidney disease. Caution is warranted when using any of the listed agents in chronic kidney disease. Alternative therapies should be explored in each clinical circumstance and the risk-to-benefit ratio of any agent must be determined by the prescribing individual. The clinician is advised to determine all medications that require dose adjustments based upon glomerular filtration rate in steady-state conditions. Pharmacy consultation is advised to optimize drug dosing, particularly in cases of acute kidney injury. Acute Kidney Injury / Acute Renal Failure Azotemia: exenatide (Byetta) has been associated with acute kidney injury. Crystalluric tubular damage: acyclovir (Zovirax), indinavir (Crixivan), sulfadiazine, triamterene, triamterene/HCTZ combinations (Dyazide, Maxzide), topiramate (Topamax), and orlistat (Xenical). Decreased creatinine secretion: trimethoprim (Proloprim, Bactrim, Septra, Sulfatrim, Polyprim), probenecid (Benemid), spironolactone (Aldactone), amiloride (Midamor), triamterene (Dyrenium), pyrimethamine (Daraprim), salicylates, and cimetidine (Tagamet). glomerular filtration rate is not reduced, although estimated glomerular filtration rate will be lowered; blood urea nitrogen does not change. Decreased glomerular filtration rate: ACEIs and ARBs reduce efferent arteriolar resistance. ARBs produce less serum creatinine elevations than ACEIs. Intratubular calciumP precipitation: oral sodium phosphate solutions (OSPS) may induce acute kidney injury in chronic kidney disease patients via intratubular calcium-phosphate precipitation with nephrocalcinosis and are contraindicated in chronic kidney disease patients. OSPS include Visicoland Osmo-Prep. Intrarenal vasoconstriction with decreased glomerular filtration rate: NSAIDs, COX-1/-2, selective COX-2 inhibitors, and calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs, eg, cyclosporine, tacrolimus) may reduce glomerular filtration rate, promote sodium retention (edema), and aggravate hyperkalemia. Long-term use of CNIs can result in nephrotoxicity in 2560% of patients and is often associated with elevated blood concentrations underscoring the importance of monitoring CNI blood levels. Tubulointerstitial nephritis (Interstitial nephritis): This disorder may represent 917% of cases of in-hospital acute renal failure and is often the etiology of acute kidney injury/acute renal failure of unknown origin. The most common sign of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis is hematuria, although classically, leukocyte casts are associated with this disorder. Microscopic evaluation of the urine should be used to confirm this often missed disorder. Allergic antibiotic-associated interstitial nephritis is common. Lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid) is associated with tubulointerstitial nephritis and in some cases, nephrotic syndrome. Idiosyncratic reactions to NSAIDs may induce immune-mediated acute or chronic interstitial nephritis. 51 Idiosyncratic reactions to NSAIDs may induce interstitial nephritis, typically in association with minimal change disease and heavy proteinuria (see above). Acute interstitial nephritis that has not improved within 24 weeks, following withdrawal of the offending agent, may be empirically treated with a 30-d course of glucocorticoid steroids. Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN): prophylactic volume expansion with sodium chlorideor sodium bicarbonate-based solutions reduces the incidence of acute kidney injury in non-edematous, stable chronic kidney disease patients. Stage 35 patients (glomerular filtration rate 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2), with or without diabetes. Saline: Isotonic (normal) saline or isotonic sodium bicarbonate prophylaxis is recommended for non-diabetic and diabetic chronic kidney disease patients. Hospitalized, non-edematous, hemodynamically stable chronic kidney disease patients should receive an infusion of isotonic sodium bicarbonate or 0. 9% saline at 1 mL/kg bodyweight for up to 12 h before, during and 12 h after contrast administration. Drugs: stop diuretics (if feasible), NSAIDs, and metformin 48 h pre-contrast delivery.",

    "text": "Drugs: stop diuretics (if feasible), NSAIDs, and metformin 48 h pre-contrast delivery. Radiocontrast medium: isosmolal radiocontrast (iodixanol, Visipaque, 290 mOsm/kg) has reduced the risk of acute kidney injury/acute renal failure in higher risk patients, ie, diabetes. Diabetes: glycemic control should be achieved prior to acute contrast delivery, eg, serum glucose 150 milligrams per deciliter. N-acetylcysteine (NAC): this agent has not been definitively proven to reduce the risk of developing radiocontrast-induced nephropathy. If used, administer 1200 magnesium po q-12 h for 4 doses: 1200 magnesium 13 h pre-contrast administration, 1200 magnesium 1 h pre-contrast and 1200 magnesium twice daily following contrast administration. Dialysis: dialysis/hemofiltration is not recommended as prophylaxis. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy: withdrawal pre-contrast administration may be beneficial. Gadolinium (Gd): Gd-based contrast agent (GABCA) procedures, eg, magnetic resonance imaging/MRA, are rarely associated with acute kidney injury. However, Gd-chelates used for magnetic resonance imaging contrast enhancement, are associated with a fibrotic skin disorder, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) that may also involve visceral organs. The risk of developing NSF is estimated at 14% in advanced chronic kidney disease. Alternatives to Gdbased imaging studies should be aggressively sought in chronic kidney disease Stages 4 and 5 and end-stage renal disease patients. Three GBCA, gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist), gadodiamide (Omniscan), and gadoversetamide (Optimark) are contraindicated for patients with acute kidney injury (acute kidney injury) or severe chronic kidney disease because NSF risk is deemed higher in these individuals. 4 GBCAs that are approved for MRIs carry new labeling explicitly warning of the risk of NSF associated with GBCA: gadofosveset trisodium (Ablavar, Vasovist); gadoxetate disodium (Eovist); gadobenate dimeglumine (Multihance); and gadoteridol (Prohance). Clinicians are advised to screen for acute kidney injury or severe chronic kidney disease before GBCA administration and to monitor kidney function post-receipt of Gd-chelates. Serial hemodialyses to remove GBCA rapidly may be required in chronic kidney disease Stages 4 and 5 patients and end-stage renal disease patients. NB: Gadodiamide and gadoversetamide may cause spurious hypocalcemia by interfering with total serum calcium assays. Avoid calcium measurements for several hours post-GBCA administration. 52 Hyperkalemia Decreased cellular potassium uptake: α/β blockers, eg, labetalol (Trandate, Normodyne) and nonselective β-adrenergic blocking agents, eg, propranolol (Inderal, Inderal LA). Decreased renal potassium secretion: Anti-RAAS therapy with ACEIs and ARBs: ARBs produce less severe potassium elevations and reduce glomerular filtration rate less than ACEIs. Decreased distal nephron potassium secretion: Amiloride (Midamor), pentamidine (Pentam-300, Pentacarinat), triamterene (Dyrenium) and triamterene/HCTZ combinations (Dyazide, Maxzide), trimethoprim (Proloprim) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole combinations (Bactrim, Septra, Sulfatrim, Polyprim). Interference with prostaglandin metabolism: NSAIDs, COX-1/-2 and selective COX-2 inhibitors decrease renal potassium secretion by interfering with prostaglandin metabolism, which produces intrarenal vasoconstriction. ARAs: Spironolactone (Aldactone) and epleronone (Inspra). High potassium-containing foods: Patients should be counseled on the avoidance of high-potassium containing foods (see NUTRITION IN chronic kidney disease). COMMENTS Renal dietary consultation is advised for persistent hyperkalemia (potassium 5. 5 milliequivalents per liter) and/or when polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexelate) is considered for treatment of hyperkalemia. The routine use of polystyrene sulfonate is not recommended. Rule out pseudohyperkalemia from elevated platelet counts, eg, 750, 000 platelet/mm3, severe leukocytosis, eg, 50, 000 white blood cell/mm3, or most commonly, prolonged tourniquet time, before treating hyperkalemia. Consult Nephrology prior to initiating hyperkalemia therapy with polystyrene sulfonate (this compound may cause bowel perforation/necrosis). Mild hyperkalemia (potassium, 5. 05. 5 milliequivalents per liter) usually requires no treatment, and dietary potassium restriction is the primary therapy. Diabetic Kidney Disease Hypoglycemia: chronic kidney disease decreases renal elimination of the active moiety or metabolite(s) of certain agents, thereby increasing the risk for hypoglycemia. The following agents may require dose reductions.",

    "text": "The following agents may require dose reductions. Insulin is eliminated/metabolized by the kidney often requiring a dose reduction of insulin of 2550%. Meglitinides: nateglinide (Starlix) requires no dose adjustment in chronic kidney disease, but repaglinide (Prandin) does require dose adjustment in chronic kidney disease. Sulfonylureas: glipizide (Glucotrol), glyburide (Diabeta, Micronase); Glipizide is preferred in chronic kidney disease as it lacks active metabolites (glyburide has active renally eliminated metabolites). Other: sulfonamide antibiotics, quinine, disopyramide, and gabapentin (Neurontin). 53 Fluid retention/Heart failure exacerbation: thiazolidinediones, eg, pioglitazone (Actos), rosiglitazone (Avandia) should be used cautiously in chronic kidney disease. Other: DPP-IV inhibitors, eg, sitagliptin (Januvia) and saxagliptin (Onglyza) have a low-risk for hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin requires dose-adjustment in chronic kidney disease. Metformin is generally contraindicated in moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (see below). COMMENTS (cid: 1)-glucosidase inhibitors: acarbose (Precose) and miglitol (Glyset) do not cause hypoglycemia, but are not recommended for estimated glomerular filtration rate 25 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 GLP-1 receptor agonists: exenatide (Byetta) is contraindicated for estimated glomerular filtration rate 30 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2; liraglutide (Victoza) may be preferred as it requires no dose adjustment in chronic kidney disease. Metabolic Acidosis Bicarbonate loss in urine: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, eg, glaucoma therapy drugs: dorzolamide (Trusopt), dorzolamide/timolol (Cosopt), and brinzolamide (Azopt). Acetazolamide (Diamox) and methazolamide (Neptazane) dosages should be reduced in chronic kidney disease and are ineffective at glomerular filtration rate 10 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2. Lactic acidosis: metformin hydrochloride (Glucophage XR, Fortamet, Riomet), and metformin-containing drug combinations: glyburide/metformin (Glucovance), glipizide/metformin (Metaglip), rosiglitazone/metformin (Avandamet), saxigliptin/metformin (Kombiglyze XR). Metformin is contraindicated, if glomerular filtration rate 50 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2, ie, serum creatinine (cid: 1)1. 5 milligrams per deciliter in males or 1. 4 milligrams per deciliter in females in chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury. Stop metformin before iodinated radiocontrast delivery and hold for 48 h post-procedure. Restart drug after kidney function returns to baseline. Mitochondrial damage: nucleoside analogs, eg, zalcitabine (ddC, Hivid), didanosine (ddI, Videx), stavudine (d4T, Zerit), lamivudine (3TC, Epivir), abacavir (Ziagen), and tenofovir (TDF, Viread), alone or in combination with other anti-HIV drugs. 54 Neurotoxicity Extrapyramidal side effects: metoclopramide (Reglan) should be reduced by 2550% in chronic kidney disease Stages 35 and only used short-term. Mental status changes/Neurotoxicity/Seizures: Acyclovir (Zovirax) and valacyclovir (Valtrex) should undergo total daily dose reductions of 5075% in chronic kidney disease Stages 35. Cefipime (Maxipime): reduce total daily dose by 50% in chronic kidney disease Stages 4 and 5. Meperidine hydrochloride (Demerol) metabolite, nor-meperidine, accumulates and can induce seizures; contraindicated in advanced chronic kidney disease. Neuropathy: Colchicine (Colcrys): relatively contraindicated in chronic kidney disease and may induce myopathy and/or neuropathy. Use no more than 0. 6 magnesium daily in chronic kidney disease Stages 4 and 5. Limit duration of use to 6 consecutive months. Nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin): absolute contraindication in chronic kidney disease Stages 4 and 5 due to risk of irreversible peripheral neuropathy. Hepatotoxicity Hypersensitivity (DRESS syndrome): This syndrome usually develops 24 weeks after initiation of treatment with allopurinol when standard dosages (20400 magnesium/day) are administered to patients with chronic kidney disease. Allopurinol (Zyloprim) should generally not be administered at total daily doses exceeding 200 magnesium in chronic kidney disease Stages 35.

PACKAGE INSERT: 56 Iron Therapy (on empty stomach) Iron therapy may be initiated at any level of hemoglobin. The degree and mode of replenishment depend on the degree of deficiency and tolerability of the patient to oral iron or iv iron therapies. Iron should be administered to replenish and maintain iron stores to the following levels: transferrin saturation 20% and ferritin 100 ng/mL in chronic kidney disease Stages 35 (end-stage renal disease: 200 ng/mL). Consult a nephrologist for assistance in appropriate dosing of parenteral iron and ESAs, which should not be initiated until the hemoglobin is 10 grams per deciliter. Oral formulations These agents should only be taken on an empty stomach. Take oral iron 2 h before or 4 h after antacids and at least 1 h after thyroid hormone. When effective at replenishing and maintaining iron stores, oral iron formulations are preferred in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients. However, oral iron agents are tolerated poorly by many patients and also, the dose required to replenish iron stores is often greater than can be delivered in a timely fashion, thus necessitating parenteral iron.",

FDA Statement on Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agents: Available at URL: Accessed 1/10/2011 62 DIAGNOSTIC CODING PRINCIPLES by Jerry Yee Introduction Coding errors are frequent in chronic kidney disease. For patients with GFRs 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 (chronic kidney disease Stage 3), the sensitivity and specificity of kidney disease diagnostic codes are 11% and 96%, respectively. Sensitivity increases to 14% in diabetic, hypertensive patients 60 y. o. with cardiovascular disease. Since chronic kidney disease is associated with multiple comorbid conditions, most chronic kidney disease patients can be assigned multiple ICD-9-CM codes: anemia of chronic kidney disease (285. 21), benign hypertension with chronic kidney disease (403. 1x), proteinuria (791. 0), dyslipidemia (272. x), metabolic acidosis (276. 2), and renal edema formation (276. 6), without heart failure. Diagnoses must be first established and documented for appropriate coding and billing. For example, a chronic kidney disease Stage 4 patient might have chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder, with associated bone disease, eg, renal osteodystrophy (588. 0), vascular calcification, hypovitaminosis D (268. 9), and secondary hyperparathyroidism of renal origin (588. 81). However, to code all of these problems, an appropriate combination of abnormal radiographs, DEXA scans or bone biopsy, elevated bonespecific alkaline phosphatase or parathyroid hormone, and low vitamin D levels would be required. Code only what you know and what you can document. Classification Kidney diseases are found in the ICD-9-Clinical Modification Tabular Index under Section 10: Diseases of the Genitourinary System (580629), principally as codes 580589. Hypertensive disorders are defined as codes 401405 in Section 7: Diseases of the Circulatory System (390 459). Complicating features of chronic kidney disease such as acid-base, fluid and electrolyte disorders are primarily found as codes 275276 in Section 3: Endocrine, Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases and Immunity Disorders (240279). Notably, this section includes codes for diabetic kidney disease, with additional specification by the level of glycemic control (250. 4x). Approach to Diagnostic Coding in chronic kidney disease Diagnostic coding of chronic kidney disease typically follows one of these patterns: a) diabetic kidney disease; b) hypertensive kidney disease; c) glomerular diseases, primary or secondary; d) vascular disorders (renal artery disease, microangiopathy); e) tubular and interstitial disorders (urinary tract infection, stones, urinary tract outlet obstruction, drug toxicity); f) cystic diseases; g) acute kidney injury; and h) kidney transplantation-related problems. Coding should be applied as specifically as possible, with appropriate utilization of 4th and 5th digits. For example, codes are specific for types 1 and 2 diabetes and their complications. Diabetic complications are assigned 4th digits (250. x), and the degree of glycemic control is assigned a 5th digit (250. xx). Diagnoses of electrolyte disorders should be completely spelled out, ie, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia must not be documented with shorthand forms or symbols: hyponatremia must be used instead of sodium and hyperkalemia must be used instead of potassium.",

    "text": "Lastly, symptoms and signs of chronic kidney disease also have specific codes, eg, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia, tenesmus, etc. 63 chronic kidney disease Codes ICD-9-CM codes for chronic kidney disease have been reclassified and parallel clinical stratification of chronic kidney disease. Before 3 months, use the acute renal failure code. After 3 months of kidney disease, a chronic kidney disease Stage-specific code should be used. The invalid Code 585 has been replaced by chronic kidney disease Stage-specific codes, 585. 1585. 6 and 585. 9 (see Tables). Specifically, code 585. 5 denotes chronic kidney disease Stage 5, but not end-stage renal disease (585. 6) or chronic kidney disease, unspecified (585. 9). If chronic kidney disease results from systemic illness, that disorder is coded first. For example, a hypertensive SLE patient with diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis of 5 months duration and laboratory findings: serum creatinine 2. 5 milligrams per deciliter, glomerular filtration rate 43 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2, blood pressure 153/90 mmHg, intact parathyroid hormone 220 pg/mL, 25(OH)D 18 ng/mL, hematocrit 29%, and UPC 5. 3, is coded as follows. Systemic disorder: SLE (710. 0); Etiology, proliferative glomerulonephritis (581. 0) and chronic kidney disease Stage 3 (585. 3). Complications: benign hypertension of chronic kidney disease (403. 1x), secondary hyperparathyroidism of renal origin (588. 81), hypovitaminosis D, unspecified (268. 9), anemia of chronic kidney disease (285. 21), and proteinuria (791. 0). Hypertension Codes Codes for hypertension are grouped as 401405. When documenting hypertension, the adjective benign or malignant should always precede the diagnosis of hypertension. Primary (essential or benign) hypertension without chronic kidney disease is coded 401. 9. However, if high blood pressure is the cause of chronic kidney disease, benign hypertension of chronic kidney disease often termed hypertensive nephrosclerosis (403. 1x) is coded first followed by a chronic kidney disease Stagespecific code. For example, an individual with hypertension for 20 years, glomerular filtration rate 50 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2, and microalbuminuria should be assigned codes 403. 10, 585. 3, and 791. 0. If hypertension follows the onset of diabetic chronic kidney disease and is not malignant (asymptomatic, not requiring hospitalization or associated with acute target organ damage), then the code for benign hypertension associated with chronic kidney disease Stages 15 but not end-stage renal disease (403. 10) should follow coding of the primary disorder with a chronic kidney disease Stage code (eg, 250. 40, 403. 10, and 585. x). In this case, the diabetic nephropathy code (250. 4x) is followed by the benign hypertension of chronic kidney disease code (403. 10), and the chronic kidney disease stage code (585. x). Hypertensive nephrosclerosis cannot be coded concurrent with primary hypertension (401. 9) or secondary hypertension (405. 0405. 9). Generalized or regional atherosclerosis often accompanies hypertension and these disorders can also be coded when actively managed. However, coding here may be more appropriately coded as unspecified hypertension, with chronic kidney disease (403. 90, 403. 91). chronic kidney disease Complication Codes This section describes under-coding of chronic kidney disease-associated complications. Mineral, electrolyte and acid-base disturbances of chronic kidney disease are often diagnosed and managed, but not coded. Hypotonicity/hyponatremia, hypertonicity/hypernatremia, dyskalemias, dyscalcemias, phosphorus disorders, and acid-base disturbances should be coded when present, appropriately documented and addressed in the treatment plan (see above). Hyperuricemia is coded as abnormal blood chemistry (790. 6) and is frequent in chronic kidney disease, but it does not define gout (274. 0274. 9) or uric acid stone disease (274. 11). 64 chronic kidney disease Code Omissions Coding omissions are frequent in chronic kidney disease. For example, the codes for hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease (404. x) are underutilized.",
