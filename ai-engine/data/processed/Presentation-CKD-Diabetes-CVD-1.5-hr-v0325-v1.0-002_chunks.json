Reduction in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is reno-protective. Importantly Elevated urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is a more common sign of chronic kidney disease than a decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate and is often missed as part of a Kidney Health Check in practice.

Not to be reproduced without permission from Kidney Health Australia 3366 How to detect albuminuria An initial urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio test should be repeated on a first void sample if the results are positive for albuminuria as urinary Protein excretion follows a circadian pattern. Where first morning void not possible, random spot specimen for urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is acceptable. Dipsticks for Protein in the Urine are now no longer recommended due to poor sensitivity and specificity. urine protein-to-creatinine ratio tests may miss microalbuminuria, resulting in false-negative results. 24-hour Urine collection is not warranted to quantify proteinuria. urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio criteria for chronic kidney disease is not applicable in pregnancy.
