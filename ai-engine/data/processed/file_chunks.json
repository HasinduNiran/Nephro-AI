In a sample of 3313 non-chronic kidney disease Iranian adults 20 years the estimated glomerularfiltrationrate(estimated glomerular filtration rate)wascalculatedatbaselineandatthreeyearintervalsduringthreeconsecutivephases. The estimated glomerular filtration rate, 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 was defined as chronic kidney disease. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independentvariablesassociatedwithincidentCKD. TheincidencedensityratesofCKDwere285. 3and132. 6per10, 000 person-year, amongwomenandmen, respectively. FemalegenderpersewasassociatedwithhigherriskofCKD, compared with males. Among women, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, known Diabetes, being single or divorced/widowed, hypertension (marginally significant)andcurrentsmokingwereindependentriskfactorsforCKD; howevertheintermediatedegreeofeducationand familyhistoryofdiabetesdecreasedtheriskby40%(P, 0. 05). Amongmalesubjects, independentpredictorsofdeveloping chronic kidney disease included aging and hypertension (with significantly higher risk than in women, P for interaction, 0. 05), estimated glomerular filtration rate, new diagnosed Diabetes, High normal Blood Hypertension; abdominal obesity decreased the risk of chronic kidney disease about 30% which was marginally significant. In the Iranian population, . 2% of individuals develops chronic kidney disease each year. Our findings confirmed that sexspecific riskpredictors shouldbeconsidered in primary preventionforincident chronic kidney disease.
