    "text": "Kidney Nighttime Blood Hypertension and Nocturnal Dipping Are Associated With Daytime Urinary Sodium Excretion in African Subjects Lise Bankir, Murielle Bochud, Marc Maillard, Pascal Bovet, Anne Gabriel, Michel Burnier AbstractBlood Hypertension (blood pressure) follows a circadian rhythm, with 10% to 15% lower values during nighttime than during daytime. TheabsenceofanocturnalBPdecrease(dipping)isassociatedwithtargetorgandamage, butthedeterminants of dipping are poorly understood. We assessed whether the nighttime blood pressure and the dipping are associated with the circadian pattern of Sodium excretion. Ambulatory blood pressure and daytime and nighttime urinary electrolyte excretion were measuredsimultaneouslyin325individualsofAfricandescentfrom73families. Whendividedintosex-specifictertiles ofday: nightratiosofurinarysodiumexcretionrate, subjectsintertile1(withthelowestratio)were6. 5yearsolderand had a 9. 8-mmHg higher nighttime systolic blood pressure (SBP) and a 23% lower SBP dipping (expressed in percentage of day value) compared with subjects in tertile 3 (P for trend (cid: 1)0. 01). After adjustment for age, the SBP difference across tertilesdecreasedto5. 4mmHg(P(cid: 2)0. 002), andtheSBPdippingdifferencedecreasedto17%(P(cid: 2)0. 05). Asimilartrend across tertiles was found with diastolic blood pressure. In multivariate analyses, daytime urinary Sodium and Potassium concentrations were independently associated with nighttime SBP and SBP dipping (P(cid: 1)0. 05 for each). These data, based on a large number of subjects, suggest that the capacity to excrete Sodium during daytime is a significant determinantofnocturnalBPanddipping. Thisobservationmayhelpustounderstandthepathophysiologyandclinical consequences of nighttime blood pressure and to develop therapeutic strategies to normalize the dipping profile in hypertensive patients.
