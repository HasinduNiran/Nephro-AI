Ferro; E-mail: Charles. ferrouhb. nhs. uk ABSTRACT The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) 2024 Guideline for Identification and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (chronic kidney disease) is a welcome development, coming 12 years after the paradigm-changing 2012 guidelines. We are living in an unprecedented European Renal Association in nephrology with novel therapies, including Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, now being proven in multiple randomized controlled clinical trials to reduce both the progression of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes 2024 chronic kidney disease Guideline is aimed at a broad audience looking after children and adults with chronic kidney disease and provide practical and actionable steps to improve care. This commentary reviews the guideline sections pertaining to the evaluation and risk assessment of individuals with chronic kidney disease from a European perspective. We feel that despite the last guideline being published 12 years ago, and the fact that the assessment of chronic kidney disease has been emphasized by many other national/international nephrology, cardiology and diabetology guidelines and societies, the diagnosis and treatment of chronic kidney disease remains poor across Europe. As such, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes 2024 chronic kidney disease Guideline should be seen as an urgent call to action to improve diagnosis and care of children and adults with chronic kidney disease across Europe. We know what we need to do. We now need to get on and do it.
