    "text": "Ask your doctor or kidney dietitian which dietary pattern is best for you. Tip If you need help finding a kidney dietitian who specializes in kidney disease, you can ask your doctor for a referral or contact the National Kidney Foundation at kidney. org/ckdrd or the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics at 800. 877. 1600 or eatright. org KIDNEY. ORG 7 Why do I need protein? Protein is an important nutrient. Your body needs protein to help build muscle, repair tissue, and fight infection. But if you have kidney disease, you may need to closely watch the amount of protein you eat to prevent protein wastes from building up in your blood. This can help your kidneys work longer. Your doctor will tell you if you need to limit how much protein you eat each day. Decisions are based on your stage of kidney disease, level of nutrition, muscle mass, and other things. Let your kidney doctor and kidney dietitian help you. Protein comes from the following: lentils and dried beans poultry (chicken and turkey unsalted nuts meats (beef, veal, fish and other seafood lamb, pork) eggs This food list is not complete. Your kidney dietitian can help you learn how to maintain good nutrition and eat the right amount of protein to help your kidneys and prevent muscle breakdown. 8 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Important Reminder There are two kinds of protein, animal protein and plant protein. Animal protein is found in products like meat, poultry, fish, and eggs. Plant protein is found in dried beans, lentils, and nuts. A wellbalanced diet for kidney patients may include either kind of protein every day. KIDNEY. ORG 9 How many calories do I need? Every person is different. Calories are like fuelthey provide your body with the energy you need to live. They are important because they: help you stay at a healthy body weight give you energy to do your daily tasks and remain active help your body use the protein in food to build muscles and tissues 10 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION It is important to plan meals that give you enough calories each day. Otherwise, your body may not have energy to stay healthy. Your kidney dietitian can help you do this. Some people may be told to eat more calories. They may need to eat extra sweets like sugar, jam, jelly, hard candy, honey, and syrup. Other good sources of calories come from fats such as unsalted nuts and oils like canola or olive oil. How do I get enough vitamins and minerals? Most people get enough vitamins and minerals to stay healthy by eating a wide variety of foods each day. However, if you have kidney disease, you may need to limit some foods that would normally give you these important vitamins and minerals. If so, you may need to take special vitamins or minerals instead. Your doctor and kidney dietitian will tell you what choices are good for you. Other Tips Take only the vitamins and minerals your doctor recommends, because some vitamins and minerals may be harmful to people with kidney disease. Check with your doctor before taking any vitamins, herbal supplements, nutrition supplements, or medicines you can buy without a doctors prescription. Some may be harmful to people with kidney disease. KIDNEY. ORG 11 How will I know if I am getting enough calories and nutrients? Your doctor will test your blood and urine. These tests will help show whether or not you are getting enough nutrients. Your kidney dietitian may also ask you about the foods you eat.",

To learn more about the tests used to check your nutrition, visit kidney. org or call National Kidney Foundation Cares at 1. 855. National Kidney Foundation. CARES (855. 653. 2273). 12 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION What if I dont want to eat or dont like my food choices? When you have kidney disease, it may be difficult to get enough nutrients from food, especially if you are on a limited-protein diet. Many people with kidney disease also find it hard to eat enough calories each day. Many supplements are available, and some are made just for people with kidney disease or diabetes. Check with your doctor or kidney dietitian before taking any supplements. Important Tip If you have diabetes and chronic kidney disease, ask your kidney dietitian how many calories you should have and what you should do to keep your blood sugar under control. Adding sweet, high-calorie foods to your meals may not be a good choice for you. Will I need nutritional supplements? Remember, not all people with kidney disease have the same dietary needs. Your doctor and kidney dietitian will tell you if you need to take nutritional supplements. Use only the supplements recommended by your doctor or kidney dietitian. KIDNEY. ORG 13 Other Nutrients Will I need to control any other nutrients? You may need to balance fluids and other important nutrients. They are: sodium phosphorus calcium potassium 14 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION SODIUM Sodium is a mineral found in most foods. It is also found in table salt. Sodium affects blood pressure and water balance in your body. Healthy kidneys can control sodium. But, if your kidneys do not work well, sodium and fluid build up in your body. This can cause high blood pressure and other problems, like swelling of your ankles, fingers, or eyes. Your doctor or kidney dietitian will tell you if you need to limit sodium. You can limit sodium by limiting table salt and foods such as: seasonings like soy sauce, sea salt, teriyaki sauce, garlic salt, onion salt, or seasoned salt most canned foods and frozen dinners (unless they say low sodium check the label) processed meats like ham, bacon, hot dogs, sausage, and deli meats salted snack foods, like chips and crackers canned or dehydrated soups (like packaged noodle soup) most restaurant foods, takeout foods, and fast foods This food list is not complete. Your kidney dietitian can teach you how to choose lower sodium foods. Learning how to read food labels can help you find foods with less sodium. KIDNEY. ORG 15 Tips Learn to read food labels so you know what you are eating. Reading labels can help you shop for foods with lower sodium and to check for added nutrients that may be bad for you. Do NOT use potassium chloride salt substitutes unless approved by your doctor. Try fresh or dried herbs and spices instead of table salt to bring out the flavor of foods. Also, try adding a dash of hot pepper sauce or a squeeze of lemon juice for flavor. 16 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION PHOSPHORUS Phosphorus is a mineral found in many foods. People with kidney disease may need to closely watch how much phosphorus is in their food. As kidney disease gets worse, the kidneys are not able to remove extra phosphorus.",

    "text": "As kidney disease gets worse, the kidneys are not able to remove extra phosphorus. Large amounts of phosphorus are found in: dairy products such as milk, cheese, yogurt, ice cream, and pudding nuts and peanut butter nondairy creamer beverages such as cocoa, beer, and dark cola drinks pancake mix processed, convenience, and fast foods, including meats that have phosphate additives to make them tender This food list is not complete. Eating high-phosphorus foods can raise the level of phosphorus in your blood. However, phosphorus from plant foods is less absorbed than phosphorus from animal foods or phosphate additives. What happens when phosphorus builds up in your blood? Your blood calcium levels drop and calcium is pulled from the bones. Over time, your bones will become weak and break easily. A high level of phosphorus in your blood may also cause calcium to KIDNEY. ORG 17 build up in your blood vessels, heart, joints, muscles, and skin, where it does not belong. This may cause serious problems such as: damage to the heart and other organs poor blood circulation bone pain skin ulcers To keep phosphorus at safe levels in your blood, you may need to limit phosphorus-rich foods. You may also need to take a type of medicine called a phosphate binder. These binders are taken with your meals and snacks to block some of the phosphorus from the foods you eat from entering your body. Your doctor and kidney dietitian will tell you if you need to limit high-phosphorus foods or take phosphate binders. Tips Using recommended milk substitutes without added phosphorus is one way to lower the amount of phosphorus in your diet. 18 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION CALCIUM Calcium is a mineral that is important for building strong bones. However, foods that are good sources of calcium are often high in phosphorus. The best way to prevent calcium loss from your bones is to limit high-phosphorus foods. You may also need to take phosphate binders and avoid eating calcium-fortified foods. Your doctor may also recommend that you take a special form of vitamin D to help keep calcium and phosphorus levels in balance, and to prevent bone disease. Do not take over-the-counter vitamin D or calcium supplements unless recommended by your kidney doctor. KIDNEY. ORG 19 POTASSIUM Potassium is another important mineral found in most foods. Potassium helps your muscles and heart work properly. Large amounts of potassium are found in: certain fruits and vegetables (like bananas, melons, oranges, potatoes, tomatoes, dried fruits, nuts, avocados, dark colored and leafy green vegetables, and some juices) milk and yogurt dried beans and peas potassium chloride salt substitutes protein-rich foods, such as meat, poultry, pork, and fish This food list is not complete. A simple blood test can check your potassium level. Too much or too little potassium in the blood can be dangerous. Some people with kidney disease need more potassium; others need less. How much you need depends on how well your kidneys are working. It also depends on whether or not you are taking any medicine that changes the level of potassium in your blood. 20 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Tips Choose low potassium fruits and vegetables such as tangerines, grapes, cherries, berries, apples, canned fruit, lettuce, cucumber, green beans, cabbage, celery, corn, peas, and cauliflower. Use long moist cooking methods that lower the potassium amount in food. Example: peel, cut, and double boil potatoes to lower potassium by half. KIDNEY.

If your kidney disease gets worse, your doctor will let you know if you need to limit fluids and how much fluid is okay for you each day. To avoid dehydration, let your doctor and kidney dietitian help plan your fluid intake. To learn more about chronic kidney disease contact the National Kidney Foundation 855. National Kidney Foundation. CARES (855. 653. 2273). 22 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION What if I have diabetes? You may need to make a few changes in your diet if you have diabetes and kidney disease. If your doctor says that you should eat less protein, your diet may need to include more carbohydrates or high-quality fats to give you enough calories. Work with your kidney dietitian to make a meal plan that is right for you. Ask your doctor how often to test your blood sugar levels. Try to keep your levels under control. Your dosage of insulin or other medicines may need to change if your kidney disease gets worse. Contact your doctor if your blood sugar levels are too high or too low. What about plant-based or meatless diets? Plant-based or meatless diets may have a positive effect on health. Eating a variety of plant foods and getting enough calories is important. Without enough calories, your body will break down the protein you eat to create energy instead. If protein is broken down, more waste products have to be removed by your kidneys. Ask about ways to check that the amount of protein you are eating is right for you. Talk with your kidney dietitian about the best sources of plant protein that have the right amounts of potassium and phosphorus to best meet your dietary needs. Your doctor or kidney dietitian can check your blood to make sure you are getting the right amount of protein and calories. KIDNEY. ORG 23 How is nutritional health is checked? You will be checked regularly by your doctor and dietitian to make sure you are getting the right nutrients that you need. Some tests are: PHYSICAL NUTRITION EXAM Your dietitian may give you an exam to check your body for signs of nutrition problems. This exam is called a Subjective Global Assessment (SGA). Your dietitian asks you about the foods you eat and looks at the fat and muscle levels in your body. The dietitian notes: changes in your weight changes in the tissues around your face, arms, hands, shoulders, and legs your food intake your activity and energy levels problems that might interfere with eating DIETARY INTERVIEWS AND FOOD DIARIES Your dietitian will ask about what you eat. You may also be asked to keep a food diary of everything you eat and drink each day. Your dietitian wants to see if you are getting the right amount of protein, calories, vitamins, and minerals. 24 NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION Questions for your healthcare professional If you have questions or are unsure about anything, write down your questions before you go to your doctor or kidney dietitian because it is easy to forget what you wanted to talk about. Make sure you ask what each test result means and what your options are. You need to understand the treatment plan that your doctor or dietitian thinks is good for you.
