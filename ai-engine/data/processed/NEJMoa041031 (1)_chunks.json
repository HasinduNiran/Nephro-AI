After adjustment, the risk of death increased as the glomerular filtration rate decreased below 60 ml per minute per 1. 73 m2 of body-surface area: the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 1. 2 with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 45 to 59 ml per minute per 1. 73 m2 (95 percent confidence interval, 1. 1 to 1. 2), 1. 8 with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30 to 44 ml per minute per 1. 73 m2 (95 percent confidence interval, 1. 7 to 1. 9), 3. 2 with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15 to 29 ml per minute per 1. 73 m2 (95 percent confidence interval, 3. 1 to 3. 4), and 5. 9 with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 15 ml per minute per 1. 73 m2 (95 percent confidence interval, 5. 4 to 6. 5). The adjusted hazard ratio for cardiovascular events also increased inversely with the estimated glomerular filtration rate: 1. 4 (95 percent confidence interval, 1. 4 to 1. 5), 2. 0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1. 9 to 2. 1), 2. 8 (95 percent confidence interval, 2. 6 to 2. 9), and 3. 4 (95 percent confidence interval, 3. 1 to 3. 8), respectively. The adjusted risk of hospitalization with a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate followed a similar pattern. conclusions An independent, graded association was observed between a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate and the risk of death, cardiovascular events, and hospitalization in a large, communitybased population. These findings highlight the clinical and public health importance of chronic renal insufficiency. 1296 n engl j med 351; 13 www. nejm. org september 23, 2004 The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.
