Early detection and management of chronic Kidney disease Zoom webinar Wednesday 16 October 7. 00 pm to 8. 00 pm Acknowledgement of traditional owners We acknowledge the Tasmanian Aboriginal people as the traditional owners and ongoing custodians of the land on which we are meeting today. We pay our respects to Elders past and present. We would also like to acknowledge Aboriginal people who are joining ultrasound today. Learning outcomes After this session, I will be able to: Outline the importance of early detection for those at risk of chronic Kidney disease Describe the elements of the assessment for chronic Kidney disease (Kidney Health Check) Define the treatment options to delay progression of Kidney disease Some housekeeping Tonights webinar is being recorded Please use the Zoom QA feature to ask questions At the end of the webinar your browser will automatically open an evaluation survey.

Where first morning void not possible, random spot specimen for urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is acceptable. Dipsticks for Protein in the Urine are now no longer recommended due to poor sensitivity and specificity. urine protein-to-creatinine ratio tests may miss microalbuminuria, resulting in false-negative results. 24-hour Urine collection is not warranted to quantify proteinuria. urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio criteria for chronic kidney disease is not applicable in pregnancy.
