Whether there have been changes in the prevalence of earlier stages of chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) during this period is uncertain. Objective To update the estimated prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional analysis of the most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES 1988-1994 and NHANES 1999-2004), a nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized adults aged 20 years or older in 1988-1994 (n 15 488) and 1999-2004 (n 13 233). Main Outcome Measures Chronic Kidney disease prevalence was determined based on persistent albuminuria and decreased estimated glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate). Persistence of microalbuminuria (30 magnesium/g) was estimated from repeat visit data in NHANES 1988-1994. The glomerular filtration rate was estimated using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation reexpressed to standard serum Creatinine. Results The prevalence of both albuminuria and decreased glomerular filtration rate increased from 1988-1994 to 1999-2004. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease stages 1 to 4 increased from 10. 0% (95% confidence interval CI, 9. 2%-10. 9%) in 1988-1994 to 13. 1% (95% CI, 12. 0%-14. 1%) in 1999-2004 with a prevalence ratio of 1. 3 (95% CI, 1. 2-1. 4). The prevalence estimates of chronic kidney disease stages in 1988-1994 and 1999-2004, respectively, were 1. 7% (95% CI, 1. 3%-2. 2%) and 1. 8% (95% CI, 1. 4%-2. 3%) for stage 1; 2. 7% (95% CI, 2. 2%-3. 2%) and 3. 2% (95% CI, 2. 6%-3. 9%) for stage 2; 5. 4% (95% CI, 4. 9%-6. 0%) and 7. 7% (95% CI, 7. 0%-8. 4%) for stage 3; and 0. 21% (95% CI, 0. 15%-0. 27%) and 0. 35% (0. 25%-0. 45%) for stage 4. A higher prevalence of diagnosed Diabetes and hypertension and higher body mass index explained the entire increase in prevalence of albuminuria but only part of the increase in the prevalence of decreased glomerular filtration rate. Estimation of glomerular filtration rate from serum Creatinine has limited precision and a change in mean serum Creatinine accounted for some of the increased prevalence of chronic kidney disease. Conclusions The prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the United States in 1999-2004 is higher than it was in 1988-1994. This increase is partly explained by the increasing prevalence of Diabetes and hypertension and raises concerns about future increased incidence of Kidney failure and other complications of chronic kidney disease. Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) is now recognized as a common condition that elevates the risk of cardiovascular disease as well as Kidney failure and other complications. 1-3 The number of patients with Kidney failure treated by Dialysis and transplantation (the end stage of chronic kidney disease) has increased dramatically in the United States from 209 000 in 1991 to 472 000 in 2004. 4 The age-, sex-, and race-adjusted incidence of end-stage renal disease increased by 43% during the decade following 1991.",

    "text": "4 The age-, sex-, and race-adjusted incidence of end-stage renal disease increased by 43% during the decade following 1991. 4 Estimation of the prevalence of earlier stages of chronic kidney disease in the ultrasound population and ascertainment of trends over time is central to disease management and prevention planning, particularly given the increase in the prevalence of obesity, Diabetes, 5, 6 and hypertension, 7, 8 the leading risk factors for chronic kidney disease. 5 Earlier stages of chronic kidney disease are defined based on the combination of Kidney damage (most often quantified using albuminuria) and decreased Kidney function (quantified as glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate glomerular filtration rate estimated from the serum Creatinine concentration). 2 The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) have provided a rigorous basis for estimating chronic kidney disease prevalence. These large nationally representative surveys conducted by the National Center of Health Statistics (NCHS) include a laboratory assessment of albuminuria and serum Creatinine allowing for identification and staging of chronic kidney disease regardless of the participant or their physicians awareness of the condition. Initial prevalence estimates for chronic kidney disease stages in NHANES 1988-1994 in adults have provided a benchmark for Kidney disease studies, prevention efforts, and health care planning. 1, 9 Later studies have compared NHANES 1988-1994 estimates with NHANES 1999-2000 data and found an increased prevalence of albuminuria but no significant increase in the overall prevalence of chronic kidney disease. The precision of these trend estimates was constrained by the relatively small sample size of the 1999-2000 survey10 and limited data to establish consistent calibration of the Creatinine assays over time. A recent study calibrating serum Creatinine in all NHANES surveys from 1988 to 2004 permits a more rigorous examination of the trends in the prevalence of chronic kidney disease using standardized Creatinine. 11 Estimation of glomerular filtration rate from serum Creatinine is the recommended approach for chronic kidney disease staging at this time and increasing evidence shows a strong association with risk even when applied to the general population. 3, 12-15 We compare the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in NHANES 1988-1994 with NHANES 1999-2004 and describe the distribution of chronic kidney disease stages and severity. The effect of the increasing prevalence of Diabetes and changes in hypertension and obesity are examined as explanatory variables for changes in chronic kidney disease prevalence in the general ultrasound adult population. Methods Study Population The NHANES are cross-sectional, multistage, stratified, clustered probability samples of the ultrasound civilian noninstitutionalized population conducted by the NCHS, a branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 16 The NHANES analyzed were conducted from 1988-1994 in 2 phases (1988-1991 and 1991-1994) and from 1999-2004 in 3 phases (1999-2000, 2001-2002, and 2003-2004), and the data from the 2 phases and 3 phases, respectively, were combined herein following NCHS recommendations. 17, 18 The protocols for conduct of NHANES were approved by the NCHS institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from all participants. 19, 20 In all NHANES, certain subgroups of the population were oversampled including Mexican Americans, non-Hispanic blacks, and elderly persons to ensure adequate sample sizes of these groups. Individuals participated in an interview conducted at home and also in an extensive physical examination performed at a mobile examination center, which included Blood and Urine collection.",

    "text": "We limited the study population to persons examined in a mobile examination center who were aged 20 years or older and who were not missing serum Creatinine measurements: 15 488 in NHANES 1988-1994 (7471 in 1988-1991 and 8017 in 1991-1994) and 13 233 in NHANES 1999-2004 (4101 in 1999-2000, 4684 in 2001-2002, and 4448 in 2003-2004). Measures of Kidney Function and Kidney Damage Serum Creatinine was measured using a kinetic rate Jaffe method. To appropriately estimate glomerular filtration rate, all serum Creatinine measurements were recalibrated to standardized Creatinine measurements obtained at the Cleveland Clinic Research Laboratory (Cleveland, Ohio) as detailed recently. 11 Briefly, frozen serum samples (approximately 200 specimens from NHANES 1988-1994 and each later 2-year survey 1999-2000, 2001-2002, and 2003-2004) were thawed and reassayed for serum Creatinine in 2006. Regression models were developed to correct serum Creatinine values in NHANES 1988-1994 and 1999-2000 (standard Creatinine 0. 184 0. 960 NHANES 1988-1994 uncalibrated serum Creatinine and standard Creatinine 0. 147 1. 013 NHANES 1999-2000 uncalibrated serum Creatinine). No correction was needed for the 2001-2002 and 2003-2004 surveys. The glomerular filtration rate was estimated using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study formula. This formula was developed based on 1628 participants in which serum Creatinine, age, sex, and race were related to glomerular filtration rate measured using urinary clearance of 125I-iothalamate. 21 The formula initially used serum Creatinine measured by a kinetic rate Jaffe method but was later reexpressed to use standard creatinine22 as follows: glomerular filtration rate 175 (standardized serum Creatinine)1. 154 (age)0. 203 0. 742 (if the individual is female) or 1. 212 (if the individual is black). Estimated glomerular filtration rate is reported in milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 and race is either black or not black. Values that exceeded 200 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 were truncated at that level and individuals were classified using standard criteria. 1 Individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate below 15 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 (chronic kidney disease stage 5) were excluded because estimates of this stage are likely to be unreliable due to the small number of individuals and the likelihood that many of these individuals are ill or receiving Dialysis and would have a Low response rate. A random spot Urine sample was obtained from participants examined at a mobile examination center using a clean-catch technique and sterile containers. Frozen nonhematuric specimens were analyzed. Urine albumin and Creatinine concentrations were measured in the same laboratory during all surveys. Albumin was measured by solid phase fluorescence immunoassay and Urine Creatinine was measured by the modified kinetic Jaffe method using a Synchron AS/Astra Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, California). Urinary albumin-to-Creatinine ratio was computed and is reported in milligrams per gram. Albuminuria is defined as an albumin-to-Creatinine ratio of 30 magnesium/g or higher, with microalbuminuria defined as an albumin-to-Creatinine ratio of 30 magnesium/g to 299 magnesium/g, and macroalbuminuria defined as an albumin-to-Creatinine ratio of 300 magnesium/g or higher. Persistent albuminuria was defined as Kidney damage (chronic kidney disease stages 1-2). Repeated measurements obtained approximately 2 weeks after the original examination in a subset of 1241 participants in NHANES 1988-1994 were used to estimate the persistence of microalbuminuria as described previously. 1, 9, 10 Briefly, the proportion of individuals with persistent albuminuria was calculated as the proportion with albuminuria at a single visit 50. 9% for those with microalbuminuria and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of more than 90 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2; 75. 0% for those with microalbuminuria and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 to 89 milliliters per minute/1.",

These same persistence estimates were applied to both surveys and all age, sex, and race groups thereby influencing only the prevalence of chronic kidney disease stages 1 and 2 but not trends over time or associations with other factors. Standard errors (SEs) incorporate sampling variation in the persistence estimates above. All albuminuria analyses excluded women who were pregnant or menstruating. The chronic kidney disease stages were categorized based on the classification system established by the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative. 1 The chronic kidney disease stages are defined as follows: stage 1, persistent albuminuria with an estimated glomerular filtration rate higher than 90 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2; stage 2, persistent albuminuria with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 to 89 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2; stage 3, a glomerular filtration rate of 30 to 59 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2; and stage 4, a glomerular filtration rate of 15 to 29 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2. NHANES 1999-2004 participants were asked if they were aware they had weak or failing kidneys and the responses were tabulated by the presence of markers of chronic kidney disease. Assessment of Demographics and Risk Factors for Kidney Disease NHANES included measurement of height and weight, which was used for the calculation of body mass index (body mass index; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Information on age, sex, race/ethnicity (categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, or all other) and smoking was based on self-report during the interview portion of the survey. Smoking status was determined using answers to the questions: Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your life? and Do you now smoke cigarettes? Hypertension and Diabetes were defined by a physician diagnosis that was self-reported by the participant because chronic kidney disease is most strongly related to these conditions. Fasting glucose (available for only half of the participants) and measured Blood Hypertension were not used in the primary analysis but yielded similar results in sensitivity analyses (data not shown). Statistical Analyses Analyses were performed incorporating the sampling weights to obtain unbiased estimates from the complex NHANES sampling design using Stata version 8. 2 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). The SEs for all estimates were obtained using the Taylor series (linearization) method following NHANES recommended procedures and weights. 16-18 Estimates and SEs were obtained for each survey period. Comparisons across surveys and 95% confidence interval (CI) estimates for chronic kidney disease stages incorporating persistence data on microalbuminuria were made using bootstrap methods implemented in Stata. Adjustment was conducted using the direct method for age and logistic regression for multiple variables. Estimates from this study are nationally representative of the noninstitutionalized ultrasound population of adults aged 20 years or older. Prevalence estimates were applied to the 2000 ultrasound census to obtain estimates of the number of individuals with chronic kidney disease in the United States in the year 2000. In hypothesis testing, a P value of less than. 05 was the level of significance used in this study. A sensitivity analysis (conservative trends analysis) was conducted by adjusting serum Creatinine so its mean level in a young healthy subgroup was identical between the 1988-1994 and 1999-2004 surveys.",

    "text": "The goal of this analysis was to determine if differences in mean serum Creatinine across surveys (potentially indicating a residual laboratory calibration difference) might explain some or all of the changes in the prevalence of chronic kidney disease. Among 8728 participants aged 20 to 39 years without diagnosed hypertension or Diabetes, the weighted mean standardized serum Creatinine levels were 0. 04 milligrams per deciliter (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88. 4) lower in 1988-1994 than in 1999-2004 (P . 001). In the conservative trends analysis, this value was added to the 1988-1994 data to make the mean value in the young healthy group identical across surveys. The later surveys were chosen as the reference group because their Creatinine assay yielded unbiased results compared with reference methods. 11 Results NHANES 1988-1994 included 15 488 participants and NHANES 1999-2004 included 13 233 participants aged 20 years or older examined at the mobile examination center with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 15 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2. During the period between the surveys, the ultrasound population became older and included a smaller proportion of non-Hispanic whites (Table 1). The shift in age distribution was less pronounced in individuals older than 60 years in which chronic kidney disease is more common. At the same time, the prevalence of self-reported Diabetes and hypertension increased as did the mean body mass index and proportion of the population that is overweight and obese, which are all risk factors for chronic kidney disease.

Mean albuminuria increased across the surveys but mean albumin-to-Creatinine ratio was not different among young healthy individuals (12. 2 magnesium/g in 1988-1994 and 12. 3 magnesium/g in 1999-2004). The mean serum Creatinine concentration was higher in 1999-2004 compared with 1988-1994, corresponding to a lower mean estimated glomerular filtration rate in 1999-2004. The conservative trends analysis, which added 0. 04 milligrams per deciliter to the serum Creatinine concentration in NHANES 1988-1994, resulted in nearly identical mean serum Creatinine concentrations and mean estimated GFRs across surveys. Figure 1 shows the distribution of albuminuria (panel A) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (panel B) in the 2 surveys. The distribution of albumin to Creatinine ratio is skewed in both surveys. There is a somewhat higher prevalence of albuminuria during 1999-2004 compared with 1988-1994 in the ranges of 35 to 49 magnesium/g and 300 magnesium/g or higher (panel A). The distribution of estimated glomerular filtration rate is more symmetric with a higher prevalence of values below 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 in 1999-2004 than in 1988-1994. The conservative trends analysis aligns the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate across surveys with implications for subsequent sensitivity analyses. Figure 1.

(opens in new tab) The inset in panel A shows the higher range of albuminuria in greater detail. Panel B includes data on glomerular filtration rate estimated from a conservative trends analysis in which 0. 04 milligrams per deciliter was added to serum Creatinine to eliminate the difference in mean glomerular filtration rate between surveys. The vertical line in panel B demarcates an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2, which defines decreased glomerular filtration rate. For both panels, the statistical testing is done for the overall mean and for meaningful categories (ie, estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 and albumin to Creatinine ratio ≥30). NHANES indicates National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. The proportion of the ultrasound population with mild, moderate, or severely reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate increased from 1988-1994 to 1999-2004 (Table 2). The combined prevalence estimate for 1999-2004 had similar precision to the 1988-1994 estimate while prevalence estimates from each of the three 2-year surveys had relatively wide 95% CIs. Moderately reduced glomerular filtration rate increased in prevalence from 5. 4% to 7. 7% (P . 001) and the prevalence of severely reduced glomerular filtration rate increased from 0. 21% to 0. 35% (P . 02; Table 2). Similarly, the proportion of the overall population with microalbuminuria on a single occasion increased from 7. 1% to 8. 2% (P . 01). The prevalence of macroalbuminuria increased somewhat from 1. 1% to 1. 3% but this difference was well within the limits of random variation (P . 37). Subdividing the prevalence of albuminuria by different levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate showed that the prevalence of microalbuminuria increased significantly among individuals with normal estimated glomerular filtration rate while all other subgroups showed no significant increase or decrease in albuminuria.

Normal was defined as an albumin-creatinine ratio of less than 30; microalbuminuria, an albumin-creatinine ratio of 30 to 299; and macroalbuminuria, an albumin-creatinine ratio of 300 or greater. The prevalence estimate for each stage of chronic kidney disease was higher in 1999-2004 than in 1988-1994 with the difference being statistically significant for chronic kidney disease stages 2 through 4 and overall (Table 3). Stratified analyses by sex and race showed similar trends. The overall prevalence of chronic kidney disease among men was 8. 2% in 1988-1994 and 11. 1% in 1999-2004. Among women, the prevalences were 12. 1% and 15. 0%, respectively.

The age-adjusted prevalence rates for chronic kidney disease stages 1, 2, 3, and 4 in 1988-1994 adjusted to the 1999-2004 age distribution in Table 1 are 1. 7%, 2. 8%, 5. 6%, and 0. 2%, respectively, for a total of 10. 3%. Trends over time were also similar within age categories, indicating the trends were not due to age differences in the population (Figure 2). In both NHANES surveys, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease increased with age with stages 1 and 2 increasing from 2% to 3% at age 20 to 39 years to 9% to 10% after the age of 70 years. The prevalence of stage 1 alone did not increase with age because an increasing prevalence of albuminuria was offset by a decreasing proportion of individuals with a glomerular filtration rate of 90 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 or higher. The prevalences for stage 3 and 4 combined were 0. 2% in 1988-1994 and 0. 7% in 1999-2004 at aged 20 to 39 years compared with 27. 8% in 1988-1994 and 37. 8% in 1999-2004 after the age of 70 years. The dramatic increase in prevalence is consistent with the known decline of measured glomerular filtration rate with age. 23 At each age, the prevalence of decreased glomerular filtration rate was higher in the 1999-2004 survey than in the 1988-1994 survey (P . 05 for ages 20-39, 40-59, and ≥70 years).

Differences in prevalence of decreased glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria between 1988-1994 and 1999-2004 remain substantial after adjustment for changes in the age, sex, and race/ethnic composition of the ultrasound population during this period (Table 4). The higher prevalence of diagnosed Diabetes, hypertension, and higher body mass index explained some of the higher prevalence. For albuminuria trends, the higher prevalence was partly explained by the older age and High proportion of minority groups (OR declined from 1. 18 to 1. 12 after adjustment). Further adjustment for the higher prevalence of diagnosed Diabetes and hypertension and higher body mass index explained practically all of the difference (OR declined to 1. 03). In the fully adjusted models, the prevalence of albuminuria was strongly associated with diagnosed Diabetes (OR, 3. 58; 95% CI, 3. 12-4. 12) and hypertension (OR, 1. 70; 95% CI, 1. 10-1. 92) as well as older age and all race/ethnicity groups other than non-Hispanic whites (P . 001) but not higher body mass index (P . 12).

    "text": "27). The proportion of individuals who reported being aware they had weak or failing kidneys in 1999-2004 (not asked in 1988-1994) was Low. In chronic kidney disease stage 3, 11. 6% (SE, 2. 0%) of men and only 5. 5% (SE, 0. 8%) of women reported being aware of having weak or failing kidneys. Even among men with chronic kidney disease stage 3 and elevated albuminuria, awareness of weak or failing kidneys was only 22. 8% (SE, 3. 9%). In stage 4, there was no longer a sex difference but the percentage was still only 42% (SE, 8%). Awareness rates increased among women between 1999-2000 and 2003-2004 but rates were Low in all survey periods. Comment Analysis of survey data from a representative sample of the ultrasound population shows that the prevalence rate of chronic kidney disease is High. Estimates from 1999-2004 are higher than those in 1988-1994, which reflected an increase in microalbuminuria as well as an increase in the prevalence of moderately and severely reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate. Overall, the prevalence rate of chronic kidney disease increased from 10. 0% (95% CI, 9. 1-10. 9) to 13. 1% (95% CI, 12. 0-14. 1). This increase was only slightly explained by the aging of the ultrasound population because the age-adjusted prevalence estimate of chronic kidney disease stages 1 through 4 only increased to 10. 3% when the 1988-1994 prevalence was adjusted to the 1999-2004 age structure. The increased prevalence of diagnosed Diabetes and hypertension and obesity explained some of the increase in prevalence. In contrast, these factors explained the entire increase in the prevalence of albuminuria. Awareness of chronic kidney disease remains very Low, even among individuals with both reduced Kidney function and albuminuria. The estimated number of individuals with chronic kidney disease increased even more dramatically because of the growth in the ultrasound population aged 20 years or older from 178 million in 1990 to 197 million in 2000. The increase in prevalence of chronic kidney disease is partly explained by the increase in a number of chronic kidney disease risk factors, including an aging ultrasound population and an increase in the proportion of individuals with obesity, diagnosed Diabetes, and hypertension. 5, 24, 25 The proportion of minority populations has also increased although the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in these populations in NHANES is not higher than that in non-Hispanic whites. This lower chronic kidney disease prevalence among ethnic minorities compared with whites is in contrast to the higher Dialysis rates in these groups and remains unexplained. One explanation could be that the MDRD Study equation performs differently in various ethnic and racial groups. Mexican Americans and Native Americans in particular were not represented in the MDRD Study in which the equation was developed. Nonetheless, the MDRD Study equation was validated in 5504 individuals and showed little bias among blacks. 26 An underestimate in whites and women may explain some of the higher prevalence in these groups. It has been hypothesized that the lower prevalence of chronic kidney disease among blacks could be due to hyperfiltration and faster progression through chronic kidney disease stage 3. 10, 27 However, differential errors in glomerular filtration rate estimation cannot be ruled out. Studies measuring glomerular filtration rate in population-based samples of individuals of different ethnicities and ages are needed. Adjustment for all risk factors explained nearly the entire increase in the prevalence of albuminuria but only a fraction of the increase in the prevalence of Low estimated glomerular filtration rate (Table 4).",

    "text": "This is partly explained by the stronger association of Diabetes with albuminuria compared with Low glomerular filtration rate. In addition, albuminuria and Low glomerular filtration rate show opposite associations with non-Hispanic black and Mexican American race/ethnicity. The chronic kidney disease prevalence estimates reported herein are higher than those reported previously. For 1988-1994, the prevalence based on the recent calibration to standard serum Creatinine concentration is 10. 0% compared with a prevalence of 8. 8% reported previously using the same criteria. This difference is the result of a difference between the initial calibration of serum Creatinine concentration to the MDRD Study Beckman Synchron CX3 method for assaying Creatinine and the most recent calibration to the Roche Enzymatic method. 28 The new calibration resulted in higher values in the 1988-1994 and 1999-2000 surveys (0. 05 and 0. 10 milligrams per deciliter, respectively, at 1. 0 milligrams per deciliter). 11 The previous calibration of the 1999-2000 survey was conducted during a single month of the survey rather than a random sample of specimens from throughout the survey period. Thus, only recently has there been data from a panel of masked frozen specimens from each survey analyzed at a single laboratory to provide a direct comparison of serum Creatinine concentration across all of the surveys. The High correlation between the original Creatinine measures and the assays performed for calibration (r 0. 98 for 1988-1994, r 0. 98 for 1999-2000, r 0. 98 for 2001-2002, and r 0. 99 for 2003-2004) lends support to our ability to make reliable comparisons. The prevalence estimates presented herein differ from those in a recent brief report, 29 which also analyzed NHANES data, for 3 main reasons: we estimated chronic kidney disease stage 1 or 2 based on persistent albuminuria rather than counting all individuals with microalbuminuria; we used the MDRD Study equation expressed in standard Creatinine because it corresponds to the calibration of NHANES serum Creatinine concentration to standard Creatinine; and we also estimated the effect of a conservative trends analysis, which indicates much of the change in the prevalence of chronic kidney disease is related to a subtle but influential difference in the estimate mean serum Creatinine concentration of the population. Despite an updated laboratory calibration traceable to criterion standard reference methods using a random sample of specimens from each NHANES survey, small residual differences in laboratory measurements across surveys cannot be ruled out. Increased muscle mass or increased Protein intake could also have increased the mean serum Creatinine concentration. Laboratory or nonKidney-related effects on serum Creatinine concentration were of particular concern because there was a higher mean standard serum Creatinine concentration in the 1999-2004 survey compared with the 1988-1994 survey, even among young participants without diagnosed Diabetes or hypertension. The persistence of the increase in chronic kidney disease prevalence from 1988-1994 to 1999-2004 even after equalizing the mean serum Creatinine concentration in a conservative trends analysis supports the conclusion that the increase in chronic kidney disease prevalence is real. However, chronic kidney disease prevalence estimates are sensitive to small differences in serum Creatinine concentration and the magnitude of the increase in prevalence could be smaller than that suggested by a simple comparison across surveys. The new data on trends in chronic kidney disease provide a larger context for trends in Kidney failure treated by Dialysis and transplantation. The ageand sex-adjusted incidence of end-stage renal disease in the United States increased 42% between 1991 and 2001.",

    "text": "The ageand sex-adjusted incidence of end-stage renal disease in the United States increased 42% between 1991 and 2001. During this time, there has been a consistent slowing in the rate of growth of treated Kidney failure rates from greater than 10% per year in the 1980s to a decrease of 1. 1% between 2002 and 2004. However, the 2004 rate of 339 per million is still far higher than the Healthy People 2010 goal of 217 per million population. 4 Furthermore, models of the treated Kidney failure epidemic suggest that even with adjusted rates leveling off, the growing prevalence of Diabetes and the aging of the population will result in a progressive increase in the number of patients treated for Kidney failure. It is estimated that by 2015 there will be 136 000 patients with incident end-stage renal disease per year and 712 000 patients with prevalent disease. 30 Our analysis suggests that the increasing prevalence of Diabetes is already leading to a measurable increase in the earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (stages 1-4). Interpretation of the High prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the ultrasound population should take into account its wide spectrum of disease severity, etiology, and comorbid conditions. Within chronic kidney disease stages 1 and 2, persistent microalbuminuria outnumbers macroalbuminuria approximately 9 to 1. Although albuminuria is the strongest risk factor for chronic kidney disease progression, it is also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 13 Chronic Kidney disease stages 3 and 4 are marked by complications of reduced glomerular filtration rate. Chronic Kidney disease stage 3 outnumbers chronic kidney disease stage 4 approximately 20 to 1; within stage 3, the upper half of estimated glomerular filtration rate outnumbers the lower half by 3 to 1. In one study, 13 chronic kidney disease stage 4 was associated with a 17. 6% risk of progression to Kidney failure and a 45. 7% mortality risk during a mean follow-up of 3 years. By contrast, in chronic kidney disease stage 3, the risk for progression to Kidney failure was 1. 1% but the mortality risk was 24. 3% compared with 0. 07% and 10. 2%, respectively, in patients without chronic kidney disease. Better data are needed to allow physicians to combine information on estimated glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria, and other clinical characteristics to predict Kidney disease progression, complications of reduced glomerular filtration rate and cardiovascular disease, as well as to establish the balance of risks and benefits for the treatment of different patient subgroups with chronic kidney disease. This study has a number of limitations including reliance on estimation of glomerular filtration rate, rather than direct measurement using injection of an exogenous marker. Equations for estimating glomerular filtration rate have limited precision compared with measured glomerular filtration rate. Imprecision and bias are greater at higher glomerular filtration rate, limiting the accuracy of classification in the mildly decreased glomerular filtration rate group. 26, 31 In addition, systematic differences between the measured and estimated glomerular filtration rate may be influenced by the population in which the equation is applied. 31, 32 Such a bias might contribute to racial/ethnic differences in prevalence estimates, but any systematic difference would apply to all of the NHANES surveys and would be unlikely to affect the trends reported herein. The persistence of albuminuria was estimated based on limited data and assumed to be the same across surveys, age, and other subgroups. The data are not sufficient to test this assumption.",

    "text": "The data are not sufficient to test this assumption. However, by assuming the same persistence in the different surveys, the trends observed cannot be the result of changes in estimated persistence rate of microalbuminuria. Differential nonresponse, particularly lower response among sicker individuals, could have biased the present prevalence estimates. This bias may be most plausible for the more advanced stages of chronic kidney disease and thus, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease stage 4 may be underestimated among individuals who volunteered to participate in NHANES. In addition, both NHANES surveys only sampled noninstitutionalized adults. Chronic Kidney disease prevalence in nursing homes and its trends over time is unknown but likely to be High. In 2000, 1. 6 million (4. 5%) adults older than age 65 years were in nursing homes. 33 In conclusion, survey data suggest that the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the United States is High and has increased between 1988-1994 and 1999-2004, from 10% to 13%, while awareness of Kidney disease among the general public remains very Low. The increasing prevalence of diagnosed Diabetes and hypertension has contributed to this increase, which may propagate to higher rates of complications and Kidney failure requiring Dialysis or transplantation. Earlier stages accounted for most of the individuals with chronic kidney disease. Because individuals with early stages of chronic kidney disease have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality than their risk of progression to Kidney failure, cardiovascular risk factor management in this group is critical. The High prevalence of chronic kidney disease overall, and particularly among older individuals and persons with hypertension and Diabetes, suggests that chronic kidney disease needs to be a central part of future public health planning.
