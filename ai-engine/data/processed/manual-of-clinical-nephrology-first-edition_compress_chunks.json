    "text": "Ans. Cushings disease is caused by increased ACTH secretion from pituitary gland that stimulates adrenals, causing excess cortisol secretion. Cushings syndrome is caused by excess steroid (cortisol) due to any cause. Q12. How to investigate Cushings syndrome? Ans. First to confirm the diagnosis and then further tests to find out the cause. Tests to confirm Cushings syndrome. Screening test: 24 hours urinary free cortisol measurement. Or, overnight dexamethasone suppression test (see below). Or, Low dose dexamethasone suppression test (see below). Or, late night salivary cortisol. Or, circadian rhythm i. If normal, Cushings syndrome is unlikely. ii. If anyone is abnormal, perform other tests and repeat the abnormal result. Cushings syndrome is confirmed by using 2 of 3 main tests: i. Failure to suppress serum cortisol with Low doses of oral dexamethasone. ii. Loss of normal circadian rhythm of cortisol, with inappropriately elevated late night serum or salivary cortisol. iii. Increased 24-hour Urine free cortisol. If Cushings syndrome is confirmed, other tests are done to find out the cause (to localize the site of lesion): Serum ACTH If ACTH is Low or undetectable: Adrenal cause is likely. Then ultrasonography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to find adrenal lesion (tumor or hyperplasia). If no mass is seen, then adrenal vein sampling or adrenal scintigraphy should be done. If ACTH is High: Likely cause in pituitary (Cushings disease) or ectopic ACTH syndrome. Other tests (to see the effect) Electrolytes (hypokalemia). Blood Glucose. Bone mineral densitometry to see osteoporosis. 4 Manual of Clinical Nephrology Scenario Instruction: Examine the abdomen and relevant.

First, ischemia during organ retrieval, from the time of cross clamping (or of asystole in non-Heart-beating donors), until cold perfusion is commenced. Second, there is a period of cold ischemia time (CIT), defined as the period wherein the Kidney is transported from donor to recipient on ice or pump perfused under hypothermic conditions. This is followed lastly by a period of warm ischemia time (WIT) during reanastomosis in the recipient (recipient WIT) between the period that the Kidney is taken out of cooling and the time that it is reperfused by the recipients Blood. A prolonged recipient WIT has been associated with poor shortand long-term graft outcomes. Short Cases 7 Delayed Graft Function Delayed graft function (DGF) has been defined as the need for Dialysis within the first week after transplantation.

Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATIONS INDUCTION THERAPY Starting a combination of immunosuppressive medications before, or at the time of, Kidney transplantation. Including induction therapy with a biologic agent as part of the initial immunosuppressive regimen in Kidney transplant recipients (KTR). An IL2-RA be the first-line induction therapy. Using a lymphocyte-depleting agent, rather than an IL2-RA, for KTRs at High immunologic risk. Initial Maintenance Immunosuppressive Medications Using a combination of immunosuppressive medications as maintenance therapy including a CNI and an anti-proliferative agent, with or without corticosteroids. Tacrolimus be the first-line CNI used. Tacrolimus or CsA be started before or at the time of transplantation, rather than delayed until the onset of graft function. Short Cases 9 Mycophenolate be the first-line anti-proliferative agent. Patients who are at Low immunological risk and who receive induction therapy, corticosteroids could be discontinued during the first week after transplantation. If mTORi are used, they should not be started until graft function is established and surgical wounds are healed. Long-term Maintenance Immunosuppressive Medications Using the lowest planned doses of maintenance immunosuppressive medications by 24 months after transplantation, if there has been no acute rejection. CNIs be continued rather than withdrawn. If prednisone is being used beyond the first week after transplantation, prednisone be continued rather than withdrawn. STRATEGIES TO REDUCE DRUG COSTS If drug costs block access to transplantation, a strategy to minimize drug costs is appropriate, even if use of inferior drugs is necessary to obtain the improved survival and quality of life and other benefits of transplantation compared with Dialysis. Strategies that may reduce drug costs include: Limiting use of a biologic agent for induction to patients who are High-risk for acute rejection Using ketoconazole to minimize CNI dose Using a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker to minimize CNI dose Using azathioprine rather than mycophenolate Using adequately tested bioequivalent generic Using prednisone long-term. MONITORING IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE MEDICATIONS Measuring CNI in Blood Every other day during the immediate postoperative period until target levels are reached Whenever there is a change in medication or patient status that may affect Blood levels Whenever there is a decline in Kidney function that may indicate nephrotoxicity or rejection. Monitoring CsA using 12-h trough (C0), 2-h post-dose (C2), or abbreviated AUC. Tacrolimus using 12-h trough (C0). MMF levels. mTORi levels.",

TREATMENT OF ACUTE REJECTION (RECOMMENDATIONS) Biopsy should be done before treating acute rejection, unless the biopsy will substantially delay treatment. 10 Manual of Clinical Nephrology Subclinical and borderline acute rejection should be treated. Corticosteroids should be used for the initial treatment of acute cellular rejection. Adding or restoring maintenance prednisone in patients not on steroids who have a rejection episode. Using lymphocyte-depleting antibodies or OKT3 for acute cellular rejections that do not respond to corticosteroids, and for recurrent acute cellular rejection. Treating antibody-mediated acute rejection with one or more of the following alternatives, with or without corticosteroids Plasma exchange; Intravenous immunoglobulin; Anti-CD20 antibody; Lymphocyte-depleting antibody. For patients who have a rejection episode, adding mycophenolate if the patient is not receiving mycophenolate or azathioprine, or switching azathioprine to mycophenolate. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC ALLOGRAFT INJURY (CAI) Kidney allograft biopsy should be done for all patients with declining Kidney function of unclear cause, to detect potentially reversible causes. For patients with CAI and histological evidence of CNI toxicity, reducing, withdrawing, or replacing the CNI is recommended. For patients with CAI, estimated glomerular filtration rate 40 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2, and Urine total Protein excretion of 500 magnesium per gram Creatinine (or equivalent proteinuria by other measures), replacing the CNI with a mTORi may be done. MONITORING Kidney ALLOGRAFT FUNCTION Measuring Urine volume Every 12 heart rate for at least 24 heart rate after transplantation; Daily until graft function is stable. Measuring Urine Protein excretion, at least Once in the first month to determine a baseline Every 3 months during the first year Annually, thereafter. Measuring serum Creatinine, at least Daily for 7 days or until hospital discharge, whichever occurs sooner 23 times per week for weeks 24 Weekly for months 2 and 3 Every 2 weeks for months 46 Monthly for months 712 Every 23 months, thereafter. Estimating glomerular filtration rate whenever serum Creatinine is measured. Short Cases 11 Including a Kidney allograft ultrasound examination as part of the assessment of Kidney allograft dysfunction. Kidney ALLOGRAFT BIOPSY When there is a persistent, unexplained increase in serum Creatinine. When serum Creatinine has not returned to baseline after treatment of acute rejection. Every 710 days during delayed function. If expected Kidney function is not achieved within the first 12 months after transplantation. When there is new onset of proteinuria; unexplained proteinuria 3. 0 g per gram Creatinine or 3. 0 g/24 heart rate. VIRAL DISEASES BK (Polyoma) Virus Screening all KTRs for BKV with quantitative plasma NAT at least: Monthly for the first 36 months after transplantation Then every 3 months until the end of the first post-transplant year Whenever there is an unexplained rise in serum Creatinine After treatment for acute rejection. Immunosuppressive medications should be reduced when BKV plasma NAT is persistently greater than 10, 000 copies/ml (107 copies/L). Cytomegalovirus CMV prophylaxis: KTRs (except when donor and recipient both have negative CMV serologies) should receive chemoprophylaxis for CMV infection with oral ganciclovir or valganciclovir for at least 3 months after transplantation, and for 6 weeks after treatment with a T-cell-depleting antibody. In patients with CMV disease, weekly monitoring of CMV by NAT or pp65 antigenemia should be done. CMV Treatment All patients with serious (including most patients with tissue invasive) CMV disease be treated with intravenous ganciclovir. CMV disease in adult KTRs that is not serious (e. g. episodes that are associated with mild clinical symptoms) be treated with either intravenous ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir. All CMV diseases in pediatric KTRs be treated with intravenous ganciclovir.",

Clinical Presentation Presents as a tetrad of skin rash, abdominal Pain, arthralgia, and renal involvement. Rash: Skin manifestations usually dominate the clinical picture. Purpuric (usually symmetrical) rash, affecting legs, buttocks (and, less frequently, arms). Abdomen, chest, and face are typically spared. New lesions may develop over several months. Histology: Leucocytoclastic vasculitis with vascular IgA and C3 deposition. Urticaria may also occur. Abdominal: GI manifestations in 3/4 patients. Nausea, Vomiting, diarrhea (may be bloody), colicky Pain (which may be severe), GI bleeding, ileus, infarction, perforation, intussusception, pancreatitis, cholecystitis. Arthralgia: Joint manifestations in 2/3 patients. Usually symmetrical polyarthralgia, mainly involving knees and ankles, wrists and fingers less common. True arthritis and permanent damage extremely rare. Renal involvement: Focal and segmental mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis presenting as haematuria, proteinuria (which can be nephrotic range), renal impairment and raised blood pressure. A renal biopsy is usually reserved for nephritic/nephrotic presentations, renal impairment, and persistent or heavy proteinuria. The severity of renal sequelae is often not related to the severity of other manifestations. Other: Pulmonary haemorrhage, cerebral vasculitis (headache, irritability, seizures, focal weakness, altered mental state), neuropathies, and orchitis. Prognosis: Usually self-limiting (usually 1 month). Follow-up is recommended Isolated microscopic (and intermittent macroscopic) haematuria may persist, but the prognosis is Good in this situation. Increase blood pressure is also probably more common. The presence of proteinuria is an adverse prognostic sign. Short Cases 27 Nephritic and mixed nephritic/nephrotic presentations have the worse prognosis (1/3 will progress to end-stage renal disease). Estimated as the cause of end-stage renal disease in 1. 53% children overall. In adults, renal involvement is more common. Complete resolution is the norm, but persistent urinary abnormalities (proteinuria) predict a worse prognosis and mandate follow-up. The renal prognosis is worse in adults than in children. Up to 40% will have chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease 15 years after biopsy. Recurrence in 1/3 cases, particularly if renal involvement (usually within 6 months). Treatment Usually symptomatic only, e. g. analgesia for arthralgia. Severe skin or GI manifestations may require corticosteroid Treatment of HSP Nephritis in Children (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Guideline) Children with HSP nephritis and persistent proteinuria, 0. 51 g/d per 1. 73 m2, are treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or ARBs. Children with persistent proteinuria, 1 g/d per 1. 73 m2, after a trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or ARBs, and glomerular filtration rate 70 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2, be treated the same way as for IgA nephropathy with a 6-month course of corticosteroid.

Class II LN (Mesangial Proliferative LN) Treat patients with class II LN and proteinuria 1 g/d as dictated by the extra renal clinical manifestations of lupus. Class II LN with proteinuria 3 g/d be treated with corticosteroids or CNIs as described for MCD Class III LN (Focal LN) and Class IV LN (Diffuse LN)Initial Therapy Initial therapy with corticosteroids, combined with either cyclophosphamide or MMF. If patients have worsening LN (rising serum creatinine, worsening proteinuria) during the first 3 months of treatment, a change be made to an alternative recommended initial therapy, or a repeat Kidney biopsy be performed to guide further treatment. 32 Manual of Clinical Nephrology Class III LN (Focal LN) and class IV LN (diffuse LN)Maintenance Therapy After initial therapy is complete, patients with class III and IV LN receive maintenance therapy with azathioprine (1. 52. 5 magnesium/kg/d) or MMF (12 g/d in divided doses), and Low-dose oral corticosteroids (10 magnesium/d prednisone equivalent). CNIs with Low-dose corticosteroids be used for maintenance therapy in patients who are intolerant of MMF and azathioprine. After complete remission is achieved, maintenance therapy be continued for at least 1 year before consideration is given to tapering the immunosuppression. If complete remission has not been achieved after 12 months of maintenance therapy, consider performing a repeat Kidney biopsy before determining if a change in therapy is indicated. While maintenance therapy is being tapered, if Kidney function deteriorates and/ or proteinuria worsens, treatment should be increased to the previous level of immunosuppression that controlled the LN. Class V LN (Membranous LN) Patients with class V LN, normal Kidney function, and non-nephrotic range proteinuria be treated with antiproteinuric and antihypertensive medications, and only receive corticosteroids and immunosuppressive as dictated by the extra renal manifestations of systemic lupus. Patients with pure class V LN and persistent nephrotic proteinuria be treated with corticosteroids plus an additional immunosuppressive agent: Cyclophosphamide, or CNI, or MMF, or azathioprine.",

    "text": "Class VI LN (Advanced Sclerosis LN) Patients with class VI LN be treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive only as dictated by the extra renal manifestations of systemic lupus. General Treatment of LN All patients with LN of any class are treated with hydroxychloroquine (maximum daily dose of 66. 5 magnesium/kg ideal body weight), unless they have a specific contraindication to this drug. Relapse of LN A relapse of LN after complete or partial remission be treated with the initial therapy followed by the maintenance therapy that was effective in inducing the original remission. If resuming the original therapy would put the patient at risk for excessive lifetime cyclophosphamide exposure, then we suggest a noncyclophosphamide-based initial regimen be used. Consider a repeat Kidney biopsy during relapse if there is suspicion that the histologic class of LN has changed, or there is uncertainty whether a rising serum creatinine and/or worsening proteinuria represents disease activity or chronicity. Short Cases 33 Treatment of Resistant Disease In patients with worsening serum creatinine and/or proteinuria after completing one of the initial treatment regimens, consider performing a repeat Kidney biopsy to distinguish active LN from scarring. Treat patients with worsening serum creatinine and/or proteinuria who continue to have active LN on biopsy with one of the alternative initial treatment regimens Nonresponders who have failed more than one of the recommended initial regimens may be considered for treatment with rituximab, intravenous immunoglobulin, or CNIs. Systemic Lupus and Pregnancy Women be counseled to delay pregnancy until a complete remission of LN has been achieved. Cyclophosphamide, MMF, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and ARBs not be used during pregnancy Hydroxychloroquine be continued during pregnancy. LN patients who become pregnant while being treated with MMF be switched to azathioprine. If LN patients relapse during pregnancy, they receive treatment with corticosteroids and, depending on the severity of the relapse, azathioprine. If pregnant patients are receiving corticosteroids or azathioprine, these drugs not be tapered during pregnancy or for at least 3 months after delivery. Administration of Low-dose aspirin during pregnancy to decrease the risk of fetal loss. LN in Children Children with LN receive the same therapies as adults with LN, with dosing based on patient size and glomerular filtration rate. 34 Manual of Clinical Nephrology Scenario Look at the picture and give your opinion There are two bullous lesions over the skin of the breast.
