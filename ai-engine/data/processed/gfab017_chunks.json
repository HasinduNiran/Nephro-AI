What this study adds? daytime and nighttime blood pressure were significantly higher in men than in women, while office blood pressure was similar. Consequently, men showed higher prevalence of masked hypertension while a white coat effect was prominent among women; ABP goal (daytime135/85 and nighttime blood pressure120/70mmHg) was achieved less frequently in men (25.",
