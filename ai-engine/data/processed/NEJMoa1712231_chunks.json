Analyses were conducted with Cox regression models, adjusted for clinic and 24-hour ambulatory Blood pressures and for confounders. RESULTS During a median follow-up of 4. 7 years, 3808 patients died from any cause, and 1295 of these patients died from cardiovascular causes. In a model that included both 24hour and clinic measurements, 24-hour systolic Hypertension was more strongly associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1. 58 per 1-SD increase in Hypertension; 95% confidence interval CI, 1. 56 to 1. 60, after adjustment for clinic Blood Hypertension) than the clinic systolic Hypertension (hazard ratio, 1. 02; 95% CI, 1. 00 to 1. 04, after adjustment for 24-hour Blood Hypertension). Corresponding hazard ratios per 1-SD increase in Hypertension were 1. 55 (95% CI, 1. 53 to 1. 57, after adjustment for clinic and daytime Blood pressures) for nighttime ambulatory systolic Hypertension and 1. 54 (95% CI, 1. 52 to 1. 56, after adjustment for clinic and nighttime Blood pressures) for daytime ambulatory systolic pressure. These relationships were consistent across subgroups of age, sex, and status with respect to obesity, Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and antihypertensive treatment. Masked hypertension was more strongly associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 2. 83; 95% CI, 2. 12 to 3. 79) than sustained hypertension (hazard ratio, 1. 80; 95% CI, 1. 41 to 2. 31) or white-coat hypertension (hazard ratio, 1. 79; 95% CI, 1. 38 to 2. 32). Results for cardiovascular mortality were similar to those for all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS Ambulatory Blood-Hypertension measurements were a stronger predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality than clinic Blood-Hypertension measurements. White-coat hypertension was not benign, and masked hypertension was associated with a greater risk of death than sustained hypertension.
