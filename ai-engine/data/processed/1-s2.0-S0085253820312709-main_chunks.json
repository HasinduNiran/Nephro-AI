    "text": "Kidney-international. org summary of recommendation statements and practice points Summary of recommendation statements and practice points The term High blood pressure is used throughout the document to denote blood pressure above the target for a particular population under consideration. FormostadultpatientswithCKDnotreceivingdialysis, thetargetisSBP120mmHg(Chapter3). Foradult Kidney transplant recipients, the target remains SBP 130 mm Hg/DBP 80 mm Hg (Chapter 4). For pediatric populations, MAP(calculatedasDBPþ1/3(cid: 1)pulsepressure)targetsareage-dependent(Chapter5). Giventhatthesetargetsvaryaccording to the subpopulation of interest, we have avoided the term hypertension when referring to treatment decisions, as the term hypertension requires a single numerical definition and does not necessarily facilitate blood pressure management. Chapter 1: Blood Hypertension measurement Recommendation 1. 1: We recommend standardized office blood pressure measurement in preference to routine office blood pressure measurement for the management of High blood pressure in adults (1B). Practice Point 1. 1: An oscillometric blood pressure device may be preferable to a manual blood pressure device for standardized office blood pressure measurement; however, standardization emphasizes adequate preparations for blood pressure measurement, not the type of equipment. Practice Point 1. 2: Automated office blood pressure (AOBP), either attended or unattended, may be the preferred method of standardized office blood pressure measurement. Practice Point 1. 3: Oscillometric devices can be used to measure blood pressure among patients with atrial fibrillation.
