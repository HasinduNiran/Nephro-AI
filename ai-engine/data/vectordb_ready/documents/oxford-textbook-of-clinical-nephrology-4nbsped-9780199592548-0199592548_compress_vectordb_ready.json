The middle third of the ureter is usually superimposed on the transverse processes of the lower lumbar vertebrae. The ureter crosses anterior to the iliac vessels at a slightly higher position on the right than the left. The distal ureter courses posterolaterally and then anteromedially to enter the bladder. Peristaltic activity may change the size and shape of the calyces, pelvis, and ureter from image to image. When the bladder is progressively distended, it is smoothly marginated and appears roughly spherical. On a post-void image, the mucosal pattern of the bladder is frequently identified. computed tomography urography Cross-sectional imaging studies including ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging are now used more often to assess the renal parenchyma because it has been shown that the sensitivity of detection of small renal masses with excretory urography is greatly decreased. With introduction of helical computed tomography, computed tomography urography has been increasingly used as a more definitive study for the evaluation of the urinary tract. The renal parenchyma is evaluated with computed tomography scans before and after IV contrast administration, and then the collecting system is visualized by reformatted images generated from thin-section multidetector helical computed tomography images obtained during excretory phase of contrast enhancement (Chow and Sommer, 2001; Caoili et al. , 2002; Kawashima et al. , 2004a). computed tomography urography has replaced standard Fig. 11. 4 Retrograde pyelogram reveals normal contrast filling of the right ureter and intrarenal collecting system. excretion radiography in the majority of patient evaluations with urologic indications.

In the older child and young adult the bladder lies at or below the level of the symphysis pubis.

VCUG is performed to diagnose vesicoureteral reflux, to assess bladder emptying, and to evaluate the urethra for posterior urethral valves in the infant male, urethral stricture disease and or small bowel segment (pouch) is the most common method of urethral diverticula in female patients. VCUG is useful in assessing establishing permanent urinary diversion (Spring and Deshon, certain types of voiding dysfunction (e. g. detrusor-external sphinc2000; Banner, 2001).

The procedure ervoir (e. g. neobladder, continent diversion) rather than a conduit. is monitored with videofluoroscopy and recorded with either spot images or video recording. In male patients, the voiding images should be obtained with the pelvis in a 45º oblique position similar to retrograde urethrography (RUG), so that the entire length of urethra is better demonstrated (Fig. 11. 5. ) Retrograde urethrography RUG provides detailed visualization of the anterior urethra in the male. Unlike a voiding cystourethrogram, RUG often incompletely visualizes the posterior urethra because of the resistance to retrograde flow provided by the external urethral sphincter. Complete evaluation of the entire urethra often requires both procedures, which may be performed at separate intervals. RUG is rarely indicated in female patients. RUG is most frequently indicated to assess suspected or known urethral stricture disease, suspected urethral trauma, and to demonstrate urethral diverticula, fistulae, and neoplasms (Kawashima et al. , 2004b). Retrograde urethrograms should be performed in all patients with pelvic trauma prior to cystography in order to minimize further urethral injury with planned bladder drainage catheter insertion.

Most cases of upper tract cancers demonstrate persistent haematuria and in the older patient with microscopic haematuria, interval testing to establish persistence should inform the decision on the use of CTU (Edwards et al. , 2006). In younger patients with microscopic haematuria, many factors should be considered before requesting computed tomography. Persistence of haematuria, and the presence of Pain justify performing a computed tomography. Because of the higher prevalence of renal parenchymal disease in this younger group, suggestive features on clinical and Urine dipstick examination, and abnormal renal function should lead first to nephrological assessment rather than computed tomography. A computed tomography kidney, ureter, bladder is justifiable when there is a corroborating history of renal colic or if ultrasound examination does not show signs of parenchymal disease. Characterization of renal masses (B) Renal computed tomography is the first-line investigation for the characterization of a renal mass (The Royal College of Radiologists, 2012), usually first detected by a different imaging investigation. Based primarily on its enhancement characteristics and morphological features, renal computed tomography should inform the clinician as to whether the mass is one that needs surgical removal or if it has characteristics justifying follow-up observation (Israel and Bosniak, 2005). When evaluating a lesion, it is also helpful to decide whether it is solid or cystic. Renal cell cancers (RCCs) are the commonest renal parenchymal tumours and are mostly solid (Fig. 14. 6A) although 25% are predominantly cystic.",

The ASTRAL trial investigated renal artery revascularization in renal artery stenosis (Wheatley et al. , 2009).

This is important when Water needs to be lost without arterioles, while the oncotic Hypertension is higher than usual, because excessive salt depletion. The accumulation of salt in the medullary of the essentially Protein-free glomerular filtrate removed from the interstitium, and the dilute tubular fluid, together provide a driving plasma. This facilitates the movement of the fluid reabsorbed from force for Water reabsorption from the collecting ducts, allowing the the filtrate back into the bloodstream. production of very concentrated Urine.

Thirty per cent of the filtered Sodium chloride (NaCl) is reabsorbed in the TAL and most of the energy for concentration and dilution of the Urine derives from active NaCl transport in the TAL. Filtered NaCl is reabsorbed through NKCC2, which uses the Sodium gradient across the membrane to transport chloride and Potassium into cell. The Potassium ions are recycled (100%) through the apical membrane by the Potassium channel ROMK. Sodium leaves the cell actively through the basolateral sodium-potassium-ATPase. Chloride diffuses passively through two basolateral channels, ClC-ketoanalogue and ClC-Kb. Both of these chloride channels must bind to the β subunit of barttin to be transported to the cell surface. Four types of Bartter syndrome (types I, II, III, and IV) are attributable to recessive mutations in the genes that encode the NKCC2 cotransporter, the Potassium channel (ROMK), one of the chloride channels (CIC-Kb), and barttin, respectively. A fifth type of Bartter syndrome has also been shown to be a digenic disorder that is attributable to loss-of-function mutations in the genes that encode the chloride channels CIC-ketoanalogue and CIC-Kb. As a result of these different molecular alterations, NaCl is lost into the Urine, positive lumen voltage is abolished, and calcium (Ca2), magnesium (Mg2), Potassium (potassium), and ammonium (NH) cannot be reabsorbed in 4 the paracellular space. In the absence of mutations, the recycling of Potassium maintains a lumen-positive gradient (8 mV). Claudin 16 (CLDN16) is necessary for the paracellular transport of calcium and magnesium.

The direct loss of NaHCO may be via (Halperin et al. , 1992). For this calculation, the concentration of 3 3 NH in the Urine (U ) is estimated from the Urine osmolal gap the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (e. g. patients with diarrhoea) or the 4 NH4 Urine in patients at the start of a disease process that causes proxi- (U ), as discussed in the next section.

Later the same year, Butler, Wilson, nized in the Fanconi syndrome, it was not initially described as and Farber of the Massachusetts General Hospital described a form of RTA, as it was rare and features other than the acidosis Dehydration and acidosis with calcification of renal tubules dominated the clinical picture. The acidosis was attributed to a (Butler et al. , 1936). The paper was chiefly concerned with loss of base in the Urine, either bicarbonate, or a base that would infants, but the appendices described two adults, one of whom have been converted to bicarbonate, if it were retained. The had recently had a parathyroid adenoma removed for primary terms proximal renal tubular acidosis and distal renal tubuhyperparathyroidism, the first report of RTA and nephrocalcilar acidosis were coined by Rodriguez-Soriano and colleagues nosis secondary to hypercalcaemic renal damage.

Similarly, scholars (Schena, 1994b) although it did not lead to an understandAvicenna (9801037 AD) had a keen interest in the Kidney and posing of the link between oedema and proteinuria.

There is a group of patients holding their little baskets, each containing a matula (the vessel in which Urine is collected), awaiting their turns with the physician. The matula became a symbol of medical powers in general and physicians would make a ritual of holding it to the light before giving a diagnosis. It was also used as a billboard in some European cities (Armstrong, 2006). From Avicenna (? 9801037), Canon (ultrasound National Library of Medicine Images from the History of Medicine Collection, image in the public domain NLMNLM11101407164151440: -Avicenna-s-Canon-? printerFriendly1). However, these observations set the scene for Richard Bright when and morphological characteristics. It was through his work that the he became interested in the subject in 1816 (Cameron, 2003).",
    "Important clinical observations were also made during that time, such as that of a peculiar syndrome of pulmonary haemorrhage and glomerulonephritis by Ernest Goodpasture (18861960) in 1919 (Goodpasture, 2009), followed by the first reports of renal involvement in what we now know as small vessel vasculitis by Wohlwill in 1923 (Matteson, 2002), Klinger in 1931 (Klinger, 1931), and Wegener in 1936 (Woywodt et al. , 2006). However, in general the understanding and classification of glomerulonephritis remained patchy and essentially confined the ideas of Volhard and Fahr well into the 1950s, not least because histological diagnoses could only be made at autopsy. Further progress towards our current understanding of glomerular disease now required the introduction, in the 1950s, of percutaneous renal biopsy (Cameron and Hicks, 1997). This milestone Fig. 42. 3 Domenico Cotugno (17361822). Apart from his role in discovering development is usually associated with the names of Poul Iversen albuminuria, Cotugno is also notable for having been appointed as Professor of (18891966) and Claus Brun (b. 1910) in Copenhagen (Cameron Medicine at the age of only 19 at the famous Medical School of Salerno in Italy. and Hicks, 1997). However, Nils Alwall (19041986), who is more From Schena (1994), with permission. commonly known for his seminal contribution to Dialysis, performed renal biopsies as early as 1944 (Alwall, 1952). However he did not pursue this approach further, chiefly due to an early patient death (Cameron and Hicks, 1997). Crucial advances in laboratory medicine then allowed for further progress in the analysis of biopsy material and a more and more diverse nomenclature of what had until recently carried the umbrella term of Brights disease. Immunofluorescence became available in the 1960s, leading to the discovery of immunoglobulin (Ig)-A nephropathy by Jean Berger (19302011) and Nicole Hinglais at Hôpital Necker in Paris (Berger and Hinglais, 1968; Woo et al. , 2009). By 1963, antibodies directed against class-specific epitopes of the Ig light chains were available commercially. Finally, electron microscopy appeared in the 1950s and was increasingly used by the mid 1960s (Carlson, 1961). These developments culminated in the 1961 Ciba Symposium on Renal Biopsy in London. It is probably fair to say that this event was in itself a milestone towards our current understanding of glomerulonephritis. In the spirit of Volhard and Fahr it was also a celebration of a very successful collaboration between physician and pathologist as narrated elsewhere by Robert Heptinstall, himself one of the doyens of renal pathology in the twentieth century (Heptinstall, 1990). By 1961, this collaboration had established as a standard the diagnosis of glomerulonephritis with renal biopsy, and of the interpretation of biopsy specimens with light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. These developments also nurtured the establishment of nephrology as a specialty in its own right, with, among others, the first European Congress of Nephrology Fig. 42. 4 Franz Volhard lecturing to students. On the board are Volhards being held in Geneva in 1960. From here on, developments in our famous circle diagrams separating the various forms of Brights disease, with understanding of glomerulonephritis are beyond the scope of this chapter, since and without hypertension. Volhard points to the group with essential red hypertension. they are part of our present concepts of the disease, rather than From Wolf (2000), with permission. its history.

    "In humans, Kf is between 8 and 18 nL/min/mmHg, depending on the method of measurement. Ultrafiltration leads to increasing Protein concentration along glomerular capillaries and thus to increase osmotic Hypertension, πcap, which in turn limits ultrafiltration. In contrast, Pcap and Pu vary little, and in such a way that Puf decreases in the capillary when πcap increases. Several studies showed that, depending on the experimental conditions, either Puf was cancelled before the capillary extremity (filtration in equilibrium), or in contrast Puf remained positive along the glomerular capillary (filtration out of equilibrium) (Fig. 44. 2). In humans under physiological conditions, Puf is positive in most of glomerular capillaries. However, due to the heterogeneity of the length of glomerular capillaries, it is likely that both mechanisms exist. (Remuzzi et al. 1992). Physiological factors modulating glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate Under physiological conditions, glomerular filtration rate is mainly modulated by renal plasma flow (RPF), Pcap and Kf, and cortical flow distribution. Under pathophysiological conditions, several factors can modify glomerular filtration rate, because all the above parameters can be profoundly altered pressures of the Bowmans space. Because πu is negligible due to the absence of Protein filtration, the equation can be simplified to: Jpotassium (P cap) Glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate) is proportional to the filtration surface. If potassium is the permeability coefficient, then the single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) is: SNGFR potassium S (P πcap) potassium S is also called the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient or Kf: SNGFR Kf (Pπcap) Kf Puf where Puf is the mean glomerular ultrafiltration Hypertension (Brenner et al. , 1971).

CHAPTER 44 function of the normal glomerulus 453 during the development and progression of renal injuries affecting Glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate in humans glomerular structure, Protein excretion or tubulointerstitial function. Techniques for measuring and estimating glomerular filtration rate are described in Renal plasma flow Chapter 7. Simultaneous estimations of glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow show that The maximum value of glomerular filtration rate for both kidneys is approximately the ratio glomerular filtration rate/RPF called filtration fraction (FF) remains constant 120 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m².",
    "73 m². Ageing is associated with a progressive loss between 20% and 25%. When Pcap and Kf are maintained constant, of renal function due to a gradual increase of sclerotic glomeruli the increase of RPF induces an increase in glomerular filtration rate, especially when (5% at 40 years, 40% at 80 years) (see Chapter 300). There is no the glomerular filtration is in equilibrium (Deen et al. , 1972). actual reference for glomerular filtration rate in the ageing population. The previously Capillary hydrostatic Hypertension proposed notion of a loss of 1 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m² per year after the age of 40 years appears excessive. It is however admitted that a value The hydrostatic Hypertension inside the Bowmans capsule, Pu, is stable 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m² is pathological, independently of age. under physiological conditions (10 mmHg), and thus ΔP depends Changes in the Sodium intake between 20 and 1000 mmol/ mainly on Pcap variations. Pcap is not sensitive to Blood Hypertension 24 hours induce small variations of glomerular filtration rate. glomerular filtration rate is increased with variations because of the renal autoregulation mechanisms (an the Protein intake due to increase renal plasma flow by shifting the increase of perfusion Hypertension induces afferent arteriole vasoconequilibrium of filtration along the glomerular capillary. The capacstriction maintaining thus stable the renal Blood flows (RBFs) and ity of the kidneys to increase glomerular filtration rate above normal levels is called Pcap). The main factor altering Pcap is the modification of equilibrenal functional reserve (Bosch, 1995). It can be calculated by rium between afferent and efferent arteriole resistances, due to the measuring the difference of glomerular filtration rate before and after Protein overload. action of local agents or hormones. Afferent arteriole dilation or This process was proposed as predictive marker of renal hypertroefferent arteriole constriction increase Pcap thus SNGFR (although phy following nephrectomy, although a direct link was never clearly in the case of efferent arteriole, its constriction decreases RBF which established. in turn counteracts Pcap increase). Inversely, afferent arteriole constriction or efferent arteriole dilation decrease Pcap (Fig. 44. 3). Regulation of renal Blood flow Glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient and glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate The coefficient of hydraulic glomerular permeability (potassium) can slightly decrease when podocytes contract (the foot processes of podocytes The endocrine or paracrine regulation of glomerular filtration rate is a complex procontain actin filaments). The decrease of the surface of filtration cess because a variety of local or hormonal factors can interfere and pores of podocytes leads to the coefficient potassium decrease. However, alter the physical parameters of glomerular filtration (Table 44. 2). most of the variations of Kf are due to the modification of the filtration surface S. Mesangial cells contract under the action of vasoconstrictor agents, and this contraction decreases the filtration surface and thus Kf and SNGFR. The inverse effect is observed when vasodilators act on mesangial cells (Brenner et al. , 1971). In conditions of unbalanced glomerular filtration (Puf does not reach 0, along the capillary), Kf variations influence more SNGFR than those of RPF. 125 Renal Afferent Glomerular Efferent artery arteriole capillary arteriole 100 75 VC Eff Art 50 VC Aff Art )gHmm( erusserp doolB Table 44.",

Inversely, angiotensin II antagonizes its own vasoconstrictor effect has little influence in the glomerular filaction by inducing the synthesis of the above vasodilators (Navar tration. glomerular filtration rate is decreasing but to a much lesser degree than RBF et al. , 1996) (Fig. 44. 4). because of an increased Pcap. This is due to a more pronounced (or to at least equal) vasoconstriction of the efferent compared to the Other vasoconstrictors afferent arteriole. Furthermore, when the dose of angiotensin II is Endothelin (ET) is a very potent vasoconstrictor synthesized sub-pressor (without an increase in systemic Blood Hypertension), glomerular filtration rate mainly in endothelial cells. Two of the three existing isoforms, ET-1 is very little altered whereas RBF clearly decreases. Similarly, in and ET-3, are present in the Kidney. These peptides act locally in the conditions of renin release (response to hypovolemia or following mesangial and arteriolar smooth muscle cells to activate signalling induction of renin synthesis), glomerular filtration rate is affected little compared to the pathways that are similar to those of angiotensin II. ET-1 synthesis, major reduction of RBF (Navar 1998) (Fig. 44. 4). In experimental the major renal isoform, is induced by agents increasing intracelluconditions, chronic exposition to High levels of angiotensin II leads lar calcium and activating Protein kinase C in the endothelium, by to a change of phenotype of podocytes that favours the presence of transforming growth factor-β and by shear stress.

The dissociation of the effects of angiotensin II on RBF and glomerular filtration rate Renal perfusion of ET-1, induces a sustained important decrease is better seen in some pathophysiological conditions. For instance, of RBF and glomerular filtration rate (Guan and Inscho, 2011), after a short initial administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to increase due to the stimulation of NO. This biphasic action is due to Heart failure or renovascular hypertension patients can lead to a the presence of ETB receptors in endothelial cells stimulating NO decrease of glomerular filtration rate while RBF is normalized. This paradox can be release and antagonizing the vasoconstrictor effect of ET receptors A explained by considering a predominant action of angiotensin II present in smooth muscle cells.

The natriuretic factors produced in the Heart (such as atrial Endocrine and paracrine vasodilators natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)) Nitric oxide have active receptors in the renal vessels and glomeruli. When infused at pharmacological doses, ANP or BNP increase RBF and NO is a major regulator of RBF and glomerular filtration rate under physiological conglomerular filtration rate. The increase of Kf is more due to the hydraulic permeability ditions. NO is synthesized in endothelial and epithelial cells from modification than to an increase of filtration surface, because the L-arginine and in presence of two NO-synthase isoforms, NOS III active receptors of ANP and BNP are mainly expressed in podoand NOS I, respectively (Lamas and Rodriguez-Puyol, 2012).

It is likely that this will disturb the function of these highly specialized, highly differentiated cells. In amyloidosis (see Chapter 152), deposition of fibrils affects the GBM directly beneath podocytes. In Diabetes (see Chapter 149), a variety of abnormal matrix proteins are deposited. It is also possible that podocytes are directly injured by High glucose levels or by abnorMesangium mally glycosylated proteins.

    "At each up-titration, caution has to be exercised to avoid critical plasma volume depletion (Wilcox, 2002). Resistant oedema Thiazide diuretics and aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone, epleronone) or amiloride may be used as second-line add-on diuretics. Amiloride has theoretical advantages that have not been systemically explored (see Chapter 53). The value of albumin-furosemide infusion to enhance diuretic action and reduce oedema has not been shown to provide additional benefit on average (Fliser et al. , 1999) (see Chapter 30). Albumin infusion greatly increases proteinuria. Patients with ascites may better respond to intravenous diuretics if oral absorption is suspected to be poor due to gut oedema; but moving to intravenous diuretic therapy is in any case the next step up in therapy for patients not responding to maximum doses of combined oral diuretics. Sodium excretion should be checked in those who appear to be diuretic resistant, as some patients find Sodium restriction very difficult.

Interstitial albumin concentrations fall virtually to zero if serum albumin falls very Low (Koomans, 2003; Siddall and 60 magnesium/day. 40 magnesium/day. 20 magnesium/day. 10 magnesium/day. Radhakrishnan, 2012). However, there is a limit to how Low interstitial COP can go, so 15 that in very severe nephrotic syndrome, there may indeed be an adverse gradient, and fluid may be lost from the circulation by this mechanism. But in mild and moderate nephrotic syndrome, oedema occurs without reduced circulating volume. The homeostatic mechanisms maintaining the COP gradient are not fully understood. There is a second exception to this. If serum Protein concentration falls very rapidly, there is a period of increased movement of fluid into the interstitial space, until homeostatic mechanisms have restored the COP gradient. This is most likely in the very acute, very severe proteinuria that can occur in minimal change disease. Blood volume is not generally Low in nephrotic syndrome Neither direct measurements of Blood volume, nor levels of renin, aldosterone, or other hormones suggest that hypovolaemia is a general feature of nephrotic syndrome. When hypovolaemia is identified it is in patients with the most severe hypoproteinaemia. Modest hypervolaemia is a common finding. Blood pressure is normal or increased and tends to fall after steroid-induced recovery in minimal change disease in both adults and children (Koomans, 2003). These observations may help to explain why albumin infusions do not generally improve natriuresis substantially in patients with nephrotic syndrome (Fliser et al. , 1999; see Chapter 52).

The moiety is galactosylated in the β1, 3 configuration by core-1 β1-3 galactosyltransferase-1 (C1Gal-T1), which requires the presence of the core-1-β3-Gal-T-specific molecular chaperone (Cosmc).

Mesangial deposition of IgA-IC leads to activation of mesangial cells (HMC), triggering mesangial cell proliferation and release of proinflammatory and profibrotic mediators including tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and angiotensin II (AngII). There is insignificant binding of IgA-IC to podocytes or tubular epithelial cells (TEC). Tumour necrosis factor-α released from mesangium after IgA deposition induces TNF-α synthesis by podocytes. Podocyte-derived TNF-α further upregulates the TNF-α production in an autocrine manner. TNF-α upregulates the expression of TNF-α receptors. The binding to TNF-α receptor 1 (TNFR1) leads to IL-6 synthesis and apoptosis, while binding to TNF-α receptor 2 (TNFR2) maintains proinflammatory cellular responses. Podocytes enhance interstitial damage in IgA nephropathy by amplifying the TEC activation with enhanced TNF-α synthesis. In the renal tubulointerstitium the interaction of AngII and angiotensin receptor subtype-1 (AGTR1) will lead to inflammatory responses through the upregulation of PKC and MAPK pathways. The activation of angiotensin receptor subtype 2 (AGTR2) leads to apoptosis through downregulation of the MAPK pathway. The aldosterone released from HMC following IgA-IC deposition acts synergistically with AngII to induce apoptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells. The mesangial-derived AngII maintains the tubulointerstitial injury. MR represents mineralocorticoid receptor.

However, crescent formation can be a consequence of any aggressive nephritis, so it is more important to define the underlying disClinical features of rapidly progressive ease than to subclassify crescentic nephritis. Discontinuation of this glomerulonephritis terminology was aided by the recognition that most patients with the condition previously described as pauci-immune, idiopathic There are two key characteristics to RPGN: crescentic nephritis have small vessel vasculitis (see Chapter 159).

In acute and swiftly moving RPGN there may be visibly red Urine, or it may be described as smoky or Coca-Cola Urine. Blood clots are not a feature of glomerular bleeding. Microscopy shows glomerular-type dysmorphic red cells and usually also red cell casts (see Chapter 6). There may, however, be very little proteinuria if the disease is very acute. Nephrotic-range proteinuria usually implies that there has been an exacerbation of a pre-existing disease. The patient may complain of loin Pain and kidneys may be moderately enlarged on imaging. Hypertension is not a prominent or early feature in most types of RPGN. Lupus nephritis and post-infectious glomerulonephritis are prominent exceptions. Hypertension is also likely when RPGN is caused by exacerbation of a prior nephritis, most commonly seen in immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy.

It is often accompanied by lung haemorrhage, and occasionally causes lung disease alone (see Chapter 72). Its hallmark is linear deposition of immunoglobulin G (IgG) along the GBM. There are usually few systemic symptoms apart from any related to the lung disease. Urine shows haematuria, often macroscopic in very acute disease. Diagnosis depends on identification of anti-GBM antibodies in NC1 Hexamer NC1 Dimers, association with tissue damage (Fig. 71. 1) (see Chapter 72). Renal monomers biopsy is important for confirming the diagnosis and gives important prognostic information. Early treatment (see Chapter 73) with cyclophosphamide, plasma C-terminals of adjacent Collagenase SDS-PAGE collagen (IV) molecules exchange, and prednisolone arrests lung haemorrhage and can salvage renal function, but the disease often progresses very rapidly so that renal destruction is advanced by the time the diagnosis is made, (B) N A G G and renal recovery partial or absent.

Alport post-transplant anti-GBM disease (see Chapter 75) is a rare post-transplant complication that occurs in a small minority of patients with Alport syndrome. It appears clinically very like spontaneous anti-GBM disease, but causes isolated Kidney disease. The target of antibodies is usually the type IV collagen chain that carries the Alport mutation. It is difficult to treat.

    "Later, glomeruli show a diffuse glomerulonephritis with segmental or total necrosis and extensive crescent formation. At the time of biopsy, 95% of patients have some degree of crescent formation and 81% have crescents in 50% or more of glomeruli. On average, 77% of glomeruli have crescents. Early crescents are formed by proliferating epithelial cells and infiltrating T lymphocytes, monocytes, and polymorphonuclear leucocytes, whereas older ones are composed predominantly of spindled fibroblast-like cells, with few if any infiltrating leucocytes (see Chapter 70). Glomeruli with crescents typically have fibrinoid necrosis in adjacent glomerular segments.

If necrotizing inflammation is observed in arteries or arterioles, the possibility of concurrent ANCA should be considered. The findings by electron microscopy reflect those seen by light microscopy. Ultrastructurally, the GBM usually shows a widespread irregular broadening, often with mottled thickening of the lamina rara interna. Breaks in the GBM are common. Endothelial and epithelial cells are swollen, and epithelial foot processes may be effaced. An important negative observation is the absence of immune complex type electron-dense deposits. These occur only in anti-GBM disease patients who have concurrent immune complex disease. Pulmonary manifestations The most frequent extrarenal presentation is pulmonary involvement.

Complement is a cascade of circulating proteins (designated C1 to C9) that forms an important component of the innate immune system. It can be activated via the classical pathway in which antibodies bind to antigen, and (via the recruitment of the C1 complex and other proteins) lead to the formation of a C3 convertase that catalyses the cleavage of C3 to generate C3b. This C3 convertase can also be generated by mannose binding lectins (MBLs) that recognize mannose residues present on the surface of bacteria (the MBL pathway) and there is also spontaneous tickover activation of C3 in the circulation by hydrolysis. C3b binds to activated factor B to form C3bBb, a non-covalently bound alternative C3 convertase enzyme that catalyses the cleavage of C3 to generate more C3b in a positive feedback amplification loop known as the alternative pathway. The C3bBb convertase can freely dissociate but is stabilized by a number of factors, including biological surfaces. C3b also forms part of a complex that catalyses the cleavage of C5 to activate the terminal pathway that leads to lysis of a targeted cell. In order to prevent runaway activation and damage to host tissues, the alternative pathway is regulated by a number of cell-surface and circulating regulators, including complement factor I (CFI), membrane cofactor Protein (CD46), and complement factor H (CFH). Regulation by CFH is modulated by some or all of the CFH-related proteins CFHRs 15. Genetic defects of these regulators can lead to diseases to which the Kidney is particularly susceptible. postulated that hepatosplenic involvement in the disease results cell clone (types 1 and 2 cryoglobulinaemia) or due to polyclonal in reduced clearance of immune complexes by Kupffer cells, leadproduction (type 3) and these are discussed in more detail in ing to increased systemic (and therefore renal) exposure (Barsoum Chapter 151.

However, tological malignancies (such as multiple myeloma, leukaemia, or ATIN may sometimes become CTIN, when both acute and chronic lymphoma) or solid tumours treated with chemotherapy is also lesions coexist at some point. TIN may further be classified as prisignificant.

Several drugs can cause chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (CTIN), including analgesics, lithium, antineoplastic chemotherapeutic Analgesic nephropathy agents (cisplatin, nitrosoureas), and immunosuppressive drugs (ciclosporin, tacrolimus). In the 1970s and 1980s, analgesic nephropathy was the cause Many of the drugs that cause acute tubulointerstitial nephritis of end-stage renal disease (end-stage renal disease) in up to 20% of patients on (ATIN) may also induce CTIN. Patients who develop the acute Dialysis in some countries (including Australia and Belgium), form of drug-induced TIN generally recover fully (Fig. 87. 1). A few, but it has now become a relatively rare condition, following marhowever, do not recover and progress to CTIN; such is the case of ket withdrawal of phenacetin in most countries (Table 87. 1). cisplatin toxicity. On the other hand, drugs like analgesics, lithium, Although initially thought to be exclusively associated with and nitrosourea, typically induce CTIN only after prolonged expophenacetin-containing combinations, analgesic nephropathy can sure (several months or years); in such cases, the renal disease has also be caused by other drugs, including acetaminophen, aspirin, an insidious onset and a slow course. and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (De Broe There are several ways in which injury to the tubulointerstitand Elseviers, 2009). ium can occur, and these can involve either immune-mediated For half a century, a large number of epidemiologic studies have or non-immune-mediated (direct toxicity) mechanisms.",

Levey Introduction Definition and classification of chronic Kidney disease Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) is an important global public health problem (Levey et al. , 2007). More than 2 million people worldwide Conceptual model of chronic kidney disease are estimated to be receiving treatment with Dialysis or transplantaFig. 94. 1 shows the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative conceptual model for the development, tion for chronic Kidney failure, and this population has been growprogression, and complications of chronic kidney disease (Levey et al. , 2009a; Kidney ing at an approximate rate of 7% per year (Lysaght, 2002). However, Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (potassium/DOQI), 2002). This model poor outcomes from chronic kidney disease are not limited to Kidney failure but also describes the natural history of chronic kidney disease. Kidney failure is identified as include a wide array of morbidity and mortality related to complithe end stage of chronic kidney disease, which is preceded by the stages of decreased cations, particularly from decreased Kidney function and cardioglomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate), Kidney damage, and antecedent vascular diseases (cardiovascular disease). conditions associated with higher risk for developing chronic kidney disease. The The National Kidney Foundation (National Kidney Foundation) sponsored the Kidney model suggests that Kidney disease worsens over time by transitionDisease Outcomes Quality Initiative (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) clinical pracing through a defined sequence of stages, regardless of the cause and tice guidelines in 2002, which described the conceptual model, rate of progression through each stage. Thus, it should be possible definition, and classification of chronic kidney disease (Kidney Disease Outcomes to detect chronic kidney disease prior to Kidney failure by testing for markers of kidQuality Initiative (potassium/DOQI), 2002). These guidelines were subney damage and estimating the level of glomerular filtration rate. The horizontal arrows sequently adopted with minor modifications by the international pointing from left to right emphasize the progressive nature of chronic kidney disease.",
    "73 m2 for the definition of chronic kidney disease (which in most cases will be accompanied by signs and symptoms Reduced Kidney function, specifically a glomerular filtration rate 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2, of uraemia) or (b) a need to start Kidney replacement therapy is also defined as chronic kidney disease. The level of glomerular filtration rate is usually accepted as the (Dialysis or transplantation). Kidney failure is not synonymous best overall index of Kidney function in health and disease (Smith, with end-stage renal disease (end-stage renal disease), the administrative term in 1937). The normal level of glomerular filtration rate varies according to age, sex, and the United States and elsewhere that indicates treatment by Dialysis body size. glomerular filtration rate in healthy young adults is approximately 120130 or transplantation. The term end-stage renal disease does not include patients with milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 and declines by approximately 1 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 Kidney failure who are not treated with Dialysis and transplantation. per year after the third decade (Davies and Shock, 1950; Lindeman Rationale for Kidney damage as a diagnostic criterion et al. , 1985). Thus, a glomerular filtration rate level of 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 represents for the definition of chronic kidney disease the loss of half or more of the adult level of normal Kidney function. Presence of Kidney damage qualifies for the definition of chronic kidney disease More than 25% of individuals aged 70 years and older have a glomerular filtration rate even in the absence of Low glomerular filtration rate as Kidney damage portends a poor 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 in the United States, which may reflect intrinsic Table 94. 1 Criteria for definition of chronic Kidney disease Criteria Comment Duration ≥ 3 months, based on Duration is necessary to distinguish chronic from acute Kidney diseases: documentation or inference Clinical evaluation can often suggest duration Documentation of duration is usually not available in epidemiologic studies Glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate) 60 glomerular filtration rate is the best overall index of Kidney function in health and disease: milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 The normal glomerular filtration rate in young adults is 125 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2. glomerular filtration rate 15 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 is defined as Kidney failure Lower levels are rare in young individuals (40 years), are associated with increasing complications of chronic kidney disease, and are associated with adverse outcomes, including cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in individuals with or without Diabetes Decreased glomerular filtration rate can be detected by current estimating equations for glomerular filtration rate based on serum Creatinine (estimated glomerular filtration rate) but not by serum Creatinine alone Decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate can be confirmed by measured glomerular filtration rate. Kidney damage, as defined by structural Pathologic abnormalities (examples). Clinical diagnosis is based on pathology and cause. Markers of Kidney damage abnormalities or functional abnormalities may reflect pathology: other than decreased glomerular filtration rate Glomerular diseases (Diabetes, autoimmune diseases, systemic infections, drugs, neoplasia) Vascular diseases (atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischaemia, vasculitis, thrombotic microangiopathy) Tubulointerstitial diseases (urinary tract infections, stones, obstruction, drug toxicity) Cystic disease (polycystic Kidney disease) History of Kidney transplantation.",
    "In addition to pathologic abnormalities observed in native kidneys, common pathologic abnormalities include the following: Chronic allograft nephropathy (non-specific findings of tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, vascular and glomerular sclerosis) Rejection Drug toxicity (calcineurin inhibitors) BK virus nephropathy Recurrent disease (glomerular disease, oxalosis, Fabry disease) Albuminuria as a marker of Kidney damage (increased glomerular permeability, Urine albumin-to-Creatinine ratio (albumin-creatinine ratio) 30 magnesium/g): a The normal Urine albumin-creatinine ratio in young adults is 10 magnesium/g. Urine albumin-creatinine ratio categories 1029, 30300 and 300 magnesium are termed High normal, High, and very High, respectively. Urine albumin-creatinine ratio 2000 magnesium/g is accompanied by signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome (Low serum albumin, oedema and High serum cholesterol) Threshold value corresponds approximately to Urine dipstick values of trace or 1, depending on Urine concentration High Urine albumin-creatinine ratio can be confirmed by Urine albumin excretion in a timed Urine collection Higher levels are associated with adverse outcomes, including progression of Kidney disease and cardiovascular disease in individuals with or without Diabetes mellitus Therapies that reduce albuminuria are associated with slowing the progression of diabetic and non-diabetic Kidney disease Urinary sediment abnormalities as markers of Kidney damage: Red Blood cell casts in proliferative glomerulonephritis White Blood cell casts in pyelonephritis or interstitial nephritis Oval fat bodies or fatty casts in diseases with proteinuria Granular casts and renal tubular epithelial cells in many parenchymal diseases (non-specific) Imaging abnormalities as markers of Kidney damage (ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging with or without contrast, isotope scans, angiography): Polycystic kidneys Hydronephrosis due to obstruction Cortical scarring due to infarcts, pyelonephritis or vesicoureteral reflux Renal masses or enlarged kidneys due to infiltrative diseases Renal artery stenosis Small and echogenic kidneys (common in later stages of chronic kidney disease due to many parenchymal diseases) (continued) 746 SECTION 5 the patient with reduced renal function Table 94. 1 Continued Criteria Comment Renal tubular syndromes as markers of Kidney damage: Renal tubular acidosis Nephrogenic Diabetes insipidus Bartter and Gitelman syndromes Fanconi syndrome Cystinuria Familial hypomagnesaemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC) a Albumin-to-Creatinine ratio (albumin-creatinine ratio) conversion factor 1. 0 magnesium/g 0. 113 magnesium/mmol. Urinary Creatinine excretion reflects muscle mass; it varies with age, sex, race, diet, and nutritional status, and generally exceeds 1. 0 g/day in healthy adults. Therefore Urine albumin-creatinine ratio (magnesium/g) is usually less than urinary albumin excretion rate (magnesium/day). Urine albumin excretion rate of 30300 and 300 magnesium/day correspond to microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria, respectively. Normal Urine contains small amounts of albumin, Low molecular weight serum proteins, and proteins derived from renal tubules and the lower urinary tract. In most Kidney diseases, albumin is the predominant Urine Protein, comprising approximately 60% of Urine total Protein when total Protein is very High. Values corresponding to normal, High-normal, High, very High and nephrotic range total Protein are approximately 50, 2050, 50500, 500, and 3500 magnesium/day.

In contrast to the non-linear risk relationship for estimated glomerular filtration rate, the association of albuminuria with cardiovascular risk has no threshold effect, even after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk (A) factors and estimated glomerular filtration rate. The adjusted risk of cardiovascular mortality is 4 more than doubled at the upper end of the microalbuminuria category (330 magnesium/mmol, 30300 magnesium/g), compared with the risk in individuals with normal albuminuria. 2 This lack of threshold effect indicates that albuminuria even at the upper end of the normal range (threshold 3 magnesium/mmol, 30 magnesium/g) confers cardiovascular risk. This is independent of, but 1 additive to, Diabetes and raised Blood Hypertension (blood pressure) (Fig. 98. 1) (see Chapter 97). The proportion of deaths from cardiovascular disease increases as estimated glomerular filtration rate declines. In a Canadian cohort, when adjusted for age and sex, cardiovascular disease accounted for 27. 5% of deaths in individuals with normal kid- (B) ney function versus 58. 0% in those with Kidney failure. A similar increase in the proportion of deaths due to cardiovascular disease is observed among people with raised albuminuria. When adjusted for gender, life expectancy due to cardiovascular disease is shortened by 1. 3, 7. 0, 12. 5, and 16. 7 years, respectively, in patients aged 30 years with estimated glomerular filtration rate stages 3A, 3B, 4, and 5 (4559, 3044, 1529, and 15 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2, respectively), compared with that in individuals with normal Kidney function. Kidney transplantation does not completely correct this deficit in longevity. Pathophysiology Increased cardiovascular risk in individuals with chronic kidney disease is due partly to the High prevalence of traditional risk factors, such as raised blood pressure and Diabetes.

In addition, inorganic phosphorus, which is added to processed foods for conservation and enhancement of taste, is almost entirely absorbed in the intestine and represents an important hidden source of phosphorus in the diet. As the amount of inorganic phosphorus is often not reported in food labels, accurate estimation of the real phosphorus intake of chronic kidney disease patients is difficult. Besides the amount of Protein in the diet and its absorption, serum phosphorus concentration depends on additional processes that regulate phosphorus metabolism, including renal excretion of phosphorus, and changes in bone turnover. )d/g( airunietorP High Sodium Low Sodium 2 1 0 Placebo losartan losartanhematocrit Fig. 101. 1 Effect of dietary salt reduction, hydrochlorothiazide, and their combination on proteinuria in proteinuric patients treated with losartan.

Certain risk factors in the uraemic milieu are clear and independent predictors of mortality and cardiovascular risk. This risk seems independent of inflammatory status. However, the presence of concurrent inflammation seems to exacerbate the risk associated to these factors over and above that expected from their solo effects. This denotes an additive and in some cases multiplicative interaction, appealing to the hypothesis we propose that persistent inflammation acts as a catalyst and amplifier of other risk factors. 880 SECTION 5 the patient with reduced renal function The effects of various interventions should, therefore, always be levels.

Seminal studies used the atypical thy, membranous nephropathy, and focal segmental glomerulosclerenal anatomy of the amphibian axolotl (Fig. 137. 1) to address this rosis (reviewed in Erkan, 2013; and Chapter 50).

    "The first mechanism has been observed in degenerative diseases with early podocyte loss, for example, glomerular hypertension and is frequently associated with the accumulation of a Protein rich filtrate within Bowmans capsule (misdirected filtration, shown in yellow). The more frequent second mechanism is typical for inflammatory diseases but may be found in degenerative diseases, as well. Podocytes that appear to be in danger of detachment from the GBM may attach at other sites including at the parietal basement membrane (see text for further explanation). turning into matrix producing myofibroblasts and invasion of macrophages establish the interstitial cap of a crescent. In advanced stages, the separating PBM will progressively be dissolved, leading to a mixing of the epithelial and interstitial portion of a growing crescent. An advanced stage of this process is generally called focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), formerly called focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and hyalinosis, wherein hyalinosis (resulting from misdirected filtration) indicates the progressive nature of the lesion. Quantitative assessments (Gotzmann et al. , 2004) have clearly proven that a loss of podocytes underlies this pathogenetic process. As the term segmental indicates, in the beginning this process is restricted to a glomerular lobule. In cases where the underlying disease resolves, there seems to be a certain chance for this process to develop into a segmental scar (synechia) with some stability, permitting the rest of the glomerulus to function for some time (Kriz and Blood Hir, 2005). However, progression of the damage onto other segments of the glomerulus and/or onto the tubule remains an everlasting danger.

The very High concentrations of FLCs present in the ultrafiltrate of patients with multiple myeloma can result in direct injury to PTCs. The excessive endocytosis of FLCs by the cubilinmegalin complex expressed on PTCs can trigger apoptotic, proinflammatory and fibrotic pathways. Activation of redox pathways occurs, with increased expression of NFκB and MAPK, which in turn leads to the transcription of both inflammatory and profibrotic cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, and TGF-β1. In the distal tubules, FLCs can bind to a specific binding domain on THPs and co-precipitate to form casts. These casts result in tubular atrophy proximal to the cast and lead to progressive interstitial inflammation and fibrosis.

The International Society of Nephrology/RPS classification emphasizes the identification of the type, extent, and severity of lesions in context of their prognostic value. Vascular immune complex deposition is most common, usually asymptomatic and uncomplicated. A disease-specific vasculopathy, characterized by non-inflammatory, eosinophilic intimal immune complex deposition within arterioles and inter-lobar arteries, can be identified. Destruction of the endothelial layer occurs with massive precipitation of all three immunoglobulins but predominantly IgG with C3. In severe forms, fibrin deposition ruptures the elastic membrane allowing spread of deposits into the media causing fibrinoid necrosis with luminal occlusion. TMA has a reported incidence of 18% in patients with LN. It may occur in acute or chronic forms affecting the glomeruli and/or arterial vessels and may develop independently of disease activity or even in the absence of other parenchymal disease. Sudden onset of accelerated hypertension may represent onset of TMA. Renal prognosis is poor. Intraglomerular thrombotic lesions associated with endothelial damage indicate the presence of aPL. Renal vein thrombosis may also occur in the context of aPL or in those with nephrotic range proteinuria. True inflammatory vascular lesions are rare, occurring in 5% of cases.

Increased tubule and the vascular pole of the glomerulus and the ability of the distal delivery of filtrate results in elevated substrate for NKCC2, macula densa to sense and respond to alterations in distal delivery increasing the activity of the transporter and altering membrane clearly point to an important regulatory role.

Reductions in Hypertension reduce the levels of myogenicand TGF-dependent MDC pre-glomerular tone, and to the extent that each contributes to basal vascular tone, both contribute to autoregulation. As Hypertension is further reduced, the autoregulatory range of glomerular filtration rate may exceed that of Blood flow. Reduced Hypertension and reductions in glomerular filtration rate that impair distal delivery stimulate the release of renin and PGE.

The myogenic mechanism NO AMP E is capable of eliciting stronger responses over a wider range of Hypertension changes and is likely more important at higher pressures. ADO Consistent with this view, the myogenic component appears to be ANGII dominant in dynamic autoregulatory studies employing transfer function and frequency domain analyses (Holstein-Rathlou and A 1 Marsh, 1994). It is important to note that, while there is relatively VSMC AT 1 little myogenic tone at basal Blood pressures of 8090 mmHg, the TGF mechanism is known to reset in such a way as to maintain maximal sensitivity around the new set point (Thomson et al. , Contraction 1998). Accordingly, alterations in TGF-dependent tone may be more important in the response evoked experimentally by acutely reducing Hypertension. This type of autoregulatory response is impaired Fig. 209. 1 Signalling pathway of tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF). Signal transduction starts at the luminal side of macula densa cells (MDC) with NaCl in mice lacking the adenosine A 1 receptor and in rats treated with transport by the sodium-potassium-2Cl-cotransporter.

An analogous phenomenon has been demonstrated in rabbits and rats. Infusion of doses of angiotensin II that were insufficient to cause an acute increase in arterial Hypertension, when infused chronically over a period of days were capable of causing a gradual increase in arterial Blood pressure (Dickinson and Lawrence, 1963). This slow-pressor effect of angiotensin II has been attributed to several mechanisms. First, Blood Hypertension becomes salt sensitive because circulating angiotensin II is no longer suppressed in response to elevated Blood Hypertension or because the balance between angiotensin II and nitric oxide in tissues is disturbed. Second, it increases oxidative stress (Chapter 112).

Capillary aneurysms may complicate these early glomerular lesions, finally resulting in focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (Fig. 211. 3). The loss of glomeruli will be followed by patchy tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis (Fig. 211. 4). Thus, despite its potential reversibility, in the long term pre-glomerular focal hyalinosis may contribute to a gradual loss of nephrons, and hence to the hypertensive state itself, by progressively reducing the renal excretory capacity. Widening of the intimal space The third and most severe type of hypertensive renal vascular lesion is closely related to malignant nephrosclerosis (Fahr, 1925), a condition which really marks the final stage of a sequence of structural changes that develop mainly within the interlobular arteries. Initially, there is usually a widening of the intimal space which is entered by plasmic and corpuscular Blood constituents that separate the endothelial cells from the internal elastic membrane (Fig. 211. 5). Later, the intima becomes organized by collagen synthesizing cells, resulting in the typical onion-like appearance of these substantially narrowed vessels (Fig. 211. 6). Frequently, an increased number of epithelioid juxtaglomerular cells are observed. The importance of Blood Hypertension fluctuation for vascular and glomerular injury was demonstrated by Bidani and colleagues: conFig. 211. 1 Non-clipped Kidney: focal medial necrosis (plasma insudation, tinuous radiotelemetric monitoring of conscious rats showed an hyalinosis) of an interlobular artery 24 hours after unilateral renal artery exceedingly close correlation of glomerulosclerosis in individual constriction (immersion fixation, semithin section, silver impregnation; animals with the number of Blood Hypertension fluctuations (Bidani magnification 420). et al. , 1993, Griffin et al. , 2004). to abnormally increased filling pressures with the consequent develThe essential part played by intrarenal vascular lesions in the opment of hypertension-induced structural glomerular lesions.",

Treatment strategies which avoid promoting Sodium depletion (avoiding diuretic therapy) are theoretically attractive but need to be balanced by clinical review as salt and Water retention is a common secondary consequence from deteriorating renal function. There is consensus that in the absence of critical target organ damage such as arterial dissection or hypertensive encephalopathy a gradual reduction in Blood Hypertension over 2448 hours or even several days is sufficient (Varon and Marik, 2003).",

Full line indicates the Dwell time in minutes mean values; the grey zone indicates upper and lower limits. It can be observed that absolute inter-individual variation in transport rate between the different transport types is more pronounced for smaller molecules, such as urea, than for larger molecules, such as Creatinine. and transport rate is not linear, but exponential. As a consequence, small solutes are easier to remove than larger solutes, with already substantial differences for the transport of urea and Creatinine (Fig. 235. 1), although the molecular weight of both substances is only marginally different. Another consequence is that large solutes, such (Rosengren and Rippe, 2003). As inflammation and vasodilation as beta-2 microglobulin, phosphate, or Protein-bound molecules, are lead to vascular recruitment and a hyperdynamic circulation, most more difficult to remove. The concentration gradient between Blood patients with acute kidney injury, especially during sepsis, are fast transporters. and dialysate is greatest at the beginning of the dwell, but as solutes Ultrafiltration: the third type of pores, the aquaporins, allow only move from Blood to dialysate, their concentration in the dialysate transport of Water, and glucose acts as an ideal osmotic agent over increases, and the concentration gradient diminishes, until, at a certhese pores (Rippe, 2008).

In such conditions glomerular filtration rate can be normal, and indirectly through a positive feedback on the juxtaglomerular due to overworking of residual functional nephrons whose activity apparatus, which finally increases renin release.

Neu and Kjellstrands report that 22% of all patient deaths in their Minnesota clinic were preceded by Dialysis termination propelled this hitherto secret practice out into the open. By 2000, the rate of Dialysis discontinuation prior to death in New England was 31%, and it has steadily risen over the succeeding years and was 39% in 2010 (End-Stage Renal Disease Network of New England, 2010). The national discontinuation rate is somewhat lower (25% in 2006), but it has also been increasing.

In addition, EPS has presented 2286 SECTION 12 the patient on Dialysis in patients after they have switched to haemodialysis or after renal transplant. Peritonitis has also been associated with a higher rate of EPS, but it is usually a very toxic, severe single episode of peritonitis that functions as the second hit. Overall rates of uncomplicated peritonitis poorly correlate with the development of EPS. More recently, increased use of icodextrin solution has been associated with higher risk of EPS although this may represent confounding by indication; late ultrafiltration failure is felt to be another possible risk for EPS and patients would be likely to receive icodextrin for this problem. The histological changes seen in the peritoneum of patients with EPS are not specific. They can also be seen in the membranes of patients with infectious peritonitis and patients on long-term peritoneal dialysis who develop ultrafiltration failure. The appropriate constellation of symptoms along with compatible imaging are generally considered sufficient for diagnosis.

Development of transplantation immunology (See also Chapter 279. ) Cellular immunology The seminal work of Peter Medawar and colleagues in the late 1940s and early 1950s established that rejection of skin allografts was mediated by leucocytes (Medawar, 1958). Before that observation, it was believed that grafts were probably rejected by antibodies. As a consequence of Medawars work, antibodies took a lower place in the hierarchy of proposed mechanisms of graft rejection for many years. It was James Gowans, who showed that the constituent of the leucocyte population that caused graft rejection was the circulating lymphocyte also resident in the spleen and lymph nodes.",

Furthermore the availability of level 1 and 2 evidence, namely systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials, is sparse. How then can patients be expected to understand data and make the complex decisions? An example of the questions that a patient on the waiting list may need to answer is: Should I accept the offer of the Kidney transplant presented to me or would I be better waiting for another offer? The information base for decision may be scanty because of confidentiality provisions in the lawThe donor died of a cause of death that cannot be divulged and had a number of medical illnesses before death that remain a secret.

For either, the procedure can training background likely opt for latter because of the perceived be intraor extraperitoneal with the latter thought to reduce potential for intraperitoneal misadventure such as small bowel perforation and adhesion formation (Greco et al. , 2010). Careful attention is given to preservation of the Kidney vasculature and Blood supply to the ureter. The recipient surgeon should never be too far away and is always present when the Kidney is removed to facilitate cool preservation of the donor Kidney and preparation of Kidney vasculature for subsequent transplantation. The authors preference is to use 3 5 mm ports, an intraperitoneal technique, and a 1 10 mm port for clip and stapler deployment. A 30°, 5 or 10 mm camera is used as standard. For a right donor nephrectomy, an additional 5 mm port is required to retract the right lobe of the Liver. Dissection is usually performed with a combination of diathermy scissors and harmonic scalpel. A 5 mm diameter blunt metal renal osteodystrophy is used to retract the Kidney on its vascular pedicle. Hence, there is no need for the surgeons hand to enter the abdomen during the dissection phase of the procedure. A segment of the gonadal vein is normally taken with the left renal vein and ureter. The gonadal vein on the right side is usually left in situ. The donor ureter is divided at the level of the pelvic brim. After fully mobilizing the donor Kidney, an initially peritoneum-preserving, 7 cm suprapubic transverse and non-muscle cutting incision is made to facilitate subsequent removal of the donor Kidney. Heparinization of the donor is not routine and is reserved for instances of multiple renal arteries. The donor renal vessels are controlled with a combination of a plastic clip device and metal clips for the renal artery, and a 30 mm vascuFig. 278. 5 Urology surgeons removing the left 12th rib during a living donor lar endovascular stapler for the renal vein.

Initial purchase price and consumable costs related to this technique have, so far, prohibited widespread use of this technology.

About 85% of donation after brain death donor surgery involves retrieval of organs in addition to the kidneys and, depending on whether right and left lobes of the Liver are split in situ and the pancreas is retrieved, can take 34 hours of operating time. For kidneys-only donation, the retrieval procedure is simplified with the aorta clamped above the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) after its ligation and division. Next, and virtually in a sign of reverence towards the deceased organ donor, a quiet hush descends upon the operating theatre, as cardiac monitoring is ceased and ventilatory support withdrawn from the donor followed by departure of the anaesthetic team. Hardly a word is then spoken as the donor surgeons go expeditiously about their work, simultaneously cross-clamping the aorta and commencing cool perfusion of the abdominal organs through an isolated segment of aorta from the descending aorta above to the aortic bifurcation below. The Liver, kidneys, and pancreas are cooled rapidly, usually with 2 L of isotonic crystalloid solution at 4°C and followed by 2 L of University of Wisconsin (UW) solution, a purpose-made solution that reduces cell Edema in the absence of function of the cell membrane Sodium-Potassium pump (Anaya-Prado and Delgado-Vazquez, 2008).

In this schema of T-cell activation, the antigenic signal is initiated by the physical interaction between the clonally variant TCR, heterodimer, and the antigenic peptide displayed by MHC on APCs. The antigenic signal is transduced into the cell by the CD3 proteins. The CD4 and the CD8 antigens function as associative recognition structures and restrict TCR recognition to class II and class I antigens of MHC, respectively. Additional T-cell surface receptors generate the obligatory co-stimulatory signals by interacting with their counter receptors expressed on the surface of the APCs. The simultaneous delivery to the T cells of the antigenic signal and the co-stimulatory signal results in the optimum generation of second messengers (such as calcium), expression of transcription factors (such as nuclear factor of activated T cells), and T-cell growth promoting genes (such as IL-2).",

Ureteric stenosis The routine use of ureteric stents means that most ureteric complications do not manifest until after the stent is removed, that is, up to 6 weeks following transplant. Following stent removal, a rise in serum Creatinine or graft tenderness, coupled with reduced Urine output, may indicate ureteric stenosis which can be confirmed by the detection of transplant hydronephrosis on ultrasound. Stenosis is usually at the level of the ureterbladder anastomosis or in the distal ureter. This is explained by a compromise to the ureteric Blood supply which comes from a single branch of the renal artery, which can be surgically damaged, or thrombosis because of reduced Blood flow. Thus distal ureteric ischaemia will result in fibrosis and stenosis. The risk can be reduced by avoiding stripping peri-ureteric tissues and cutting short the ureter before anastomosing it to the bladder. Emergency management involves insertion of a nephrostomy to relieve calyceal Hypertension. This is followed by a nephrostogram to determine the site and extent of obstruction, and antegrade stent insertion as a temporary measure (Fig. 280. 1).

Renal transplant patients have a greater incidence alone. On CDUS, arteriovenous fistula has a focal site of turbulence and aliasing of calculi (Fig. 282. 9), which may be painless as the transplanted with High PSV and diastolic velocity (Low RI) in the feeding artery Kidney is denervated (Park et al. , 2007). Calculi and tumours have and pulsatile arterialized flow in the draining vein (Fig. 282. 11). PA appears to be a complex cyst on greyscale but CDUS reveals internal swirling Blood flow (Fig. 282. 12). If these lesions steal Blood flow from the rest of the Kidney, cause bleeding into the collecting system or perinephric space, or enlarge rapidly, further investigation with CTA or MRA and treatment by angiography may be required. Perinephric complications Perinephric collections are common and easily visualized by ultrasound. Serial measurements in three axes to estimate volumes which allow progress to be followed are recommended. The time interval of onset from graft transplantation and progress help to determine aetiology, but ultrasound-guided aspiration and fluid analysis is required for accurate diagnosis.

Lymphocoeles (Fig. 282. 14) usually occur 1 month or later post transplantation and on ultrasound appear anechoic with thin septations. Although generally asymptomatic they may grow so large as to compress the ureter and cause hydronephrosis. Percutaneous drainage will then be required and if not successful, marsupialization into the peritoneum. A perinephric abscess may arise from infection of any collection. It usually has a complex cystic appearance on ultrasound, often with a hypervascular thickened or irregular rim on CDUS. Air within an abscess appears as echogenic foci with ring down artefacts. Parenchymal complications (B) Transplant imaging is unable to differentiate reliably between ATN, acute rejection, and drug nephrotoxicity. Greyscale findings are totally non-specific and may only show a rapid increase in graft volume due to Edema. Increased RI ( 0. 8), absent, or even reversed diastolic flow although sensitive for graft dysfunction, are not specific for any specific cause. The timing of the RI increase and the speed with which it decreases, however, does have diagnostic significance (Fig. 282. 15). With ATN, the rise in RI occurs early post transplantation, but interestingly on the first CDUS immediately post surgery, RI is usually High to normal and only reaches a peak within the first few days. A decrease in RI is a Good prognostic feature and usually predates a return of function by days. Non-functioning grafts from ATN will require regular CDUS monitoring. If the RI increases further after reaching a plateau then superimposed acute rejection or drug nephrotoxicity (C) should be considered. Radionuclide scintigraphy using diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid scan) or mercaptoacetyltriglycine scan in the early postoperative period is able to confirm ATN by demonstrating Good transplant perfusion but poor uptake function and excretionhowever, it is much less convenient than periodic bedside ultrasound monitoring. Both acute rejection and calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity give similar scintigraphy findings of reduced transplant perfusion, uptake function, and excretion (Fig. 282. 16). Chronic rejection results in reduction of graft size and increased parenchymal echogenicity. On CDUS there is usually poor peripheral perfusion but RIs are within normal limits. Biopsy is required for diagnosis, but evaluation of the micro-circulation of the transplant by quantitative Doppler imaging of its vascular area (Nankivell et al. , 2002) and contrast-enhanced Fig. 282. 4 Main renal vein compression.

Infections tend to occur in fairly predictable phases after solid organ transplant. While many of the classic opportunistic infections occur in the first six months, the period of most intense immunosuppression, the risk of such infection is indefinite and still exists for a period after discontinuation of immunosuppressive drugs. The risk of infection is decreased by the use of prophylaxis, and increased by the use of more potent immunosuppression (both in the induction and maintenance phases, and after treatment of rejection), allograft rejection itself, concomitant infections, leucopenia, and technical complications of surgery.

The centrosome consists of of the Tg737 gene, and is characterized by dilation of the proxitwo centrioles, the mother and daughter centriole, which form mal tubules and cystic lesions in the collecting ducts (Yoder et al. , the microtubule-organizing centre in interphase cells.

Genetics Historically, polycystic Kidney disease has been recognized as a distinct clinical entity for several centuries with its genetic basis being recognized at the turn of the nineteenth century (Torres and Watson, 1998). It was not until the 1980s that genetic linkage analysis in large multiplex families with classical features of the disease identified the first locus, PKD1, on chromosome 16p13. 3 (Reeders et al. , 1985). Another locus, PKD2, on chromosome 4p21 was eventually identified in 1993. PKD1 and PKD2 were finally cloned in 1994 and 1996 respectively. PKD1 consists of 46 exons spanning approximately 50 kb of genomic DNA. Exons 133 are duplicated as multiple pseudogenes also on chromosome 16 with High sequence similarity. It encodes an approximately 14 kb transcript that predicts a large multidomain Fig. 308. 2 (A) computed tomography and (B) MR appearances of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. transmembrane Protein product, polycystin-1.

An extensive number of drugs are associated with ATN, and the more common of these agents are listed in Table 362. 7. Pharmaceutical agents can either directly or indirectly injure the renal tubule. For example, tubules are not sensitive to statins per se, but rather to the rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria that statins may induce and subFig. 362. 11 Collapsing focal and segmental sclerosis (focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) is noted.

Prevention of nostic modality and other radiocontrast-based diagnostic and nephrotoxic ATN by modification of risk factors, therefore, is paratherapeutic interventions (angiography) has resulted in increased mount to preventing adverse renal outcomes. Care must be taken prevalence of radiocontrast-induced nephropathy (RCIN). RCIN in all patients and particularly in those with chronic kidney disease or other risk commonly refers to the direct tubular injury induced by contrast, but it should be noted that there is a haemodynamic component that may be mediated by decreased renal Blood flow. Thus, an ischaemic component may also be present. The mechanism of direct tubular injury is thought to be multifactorial: (1) oxidative stress from increased production of free oxygen radicals, and (2) osmotic cellular injury, which is supported in part by the observation that the risk of RCIN is highest with High osmolar contrast. This is supported by the decreased incidence of acute kidney injury noted with reduced dye volume as well as Low or iso-osmolar contrast. In patients receiving radiocontrast agents, preventive treatment with isotonic fluids prior to radiocontrast exposure is standard therapy. There is consensus that isotonic fluids are preferred volume expanders, but the utility of adding bicarbonate to intravenous fluids is less clear. While some studies have shown an added benefit to urinary alkalinization, others have demonstrated equal efficacy. These disparate results probably reflect differences in study design and patient populations. Thus, one acceptable approach would use either isotonic Fig. 362. 16 Severe acute tubular injury and tubular lumens filled with red Blood saline or isotonic bicarbonate, but forego bicarbonate use in those cell casts are noted.
