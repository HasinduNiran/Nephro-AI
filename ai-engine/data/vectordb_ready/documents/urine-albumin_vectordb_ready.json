Abstract Introduction: The Malaysian Association of Clinical Biochemists (MACB) established a Task Force for Chronic Kidney Disease. A survey was undertaken by the Task Force on the reporting of estimated glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate) and Urine albumin by hospital laboratories in Malaysia in both the government and private sectors. Materials and Methods: An e-mail invitation to participate in an online survey was sent to hospital laboratories in Malaysia (n140). Questions regarding methods for measuring Creatinine, equations for calculating estimated glomerular filtration rate, estimated glomerular filtration rate reporting, the terminology used in reporting Urine albumin, types of samples and the cut-off values used for normal albuminuria. Results: A total of 42/140 (30%) laboratories answered the questionnaire. The prevalent method used for serum Creatinine measurement was the Jaffé method (88. 1%) traceable to isotope-dilution mass spectrometry. estimated glomerular filtration rate was reported along with serum Creatinine by 61. 9% of laboratories while 33. 3% of laboratories report estimated glomerular filtration rate on request. The formula used for estimated glomerular filtration rate reporting was mainly MDRD (64. 3%) and results were reported as exact numbers even when the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73m2. The term microalbumin is still used by 83. 3% of laboratories. There is a large heterogeneity among the labs regarding the type of sample recommended for measuring Urine albumin, reference interval and reporting units. Conclusion: It is evident that the laboratory assessment of chronic Kidney disease in Malaysia is not standardised. It is essential to provide a national framework for standardised reporting of estimated glomerular filtration rate and Urine albumin. Recommendations developed by the MACB chronic kidney disease Task Force, if adopted by all laboratories, will lead to a reduction in this variability. Keywords: chronic kidney disease, estimated glomerular filtration rate, Urine albumin INTRODUCTION chronic kidney disease is a glomerular filtration rate value 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73m2. A glomerular filtration rate 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73m2 can be detected by routine Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) represents laboratory testing. Equations for calculating a significant public health problem because estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate) based on serum Creatinine of its associated socio-economic and health (serum creatinine) are sensitive for detecting measured glomerular filtration rate consequences. In 2011, the National Health 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73m2. 3 The National Pathology and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) showed a Service of Malaysia implemented reporting of 9. 07% prevalence of chronic kidney disease in West Malaysia. 1 estimated glomerular filtration rate using the Modification of Diet in Renal However, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in Malaysia had Disease (MDRD) formula in the year 2012. 4 increased to 15. 48% in 2018. 2 chronic kidney disease is defined as Pertaining to Urine albumin measurement, Urine an abnormality of Kidney structure or function, albumin/Creatinine ratio of 2. 5 to 30 magnesium/mmol is present for 3 months.",

The online Guideline for the Evaluation and Management survey was performed using the Google form. of Chronic Kidney Disease. 5 The diagnosis A simple questionnaire was designed comprising and staging of chronic kidney disease are based on estimated glomerular filtration rate and 11 questions (Table 1) seeking information about albuminuria. The recommended formula for current practice in biochemistry laboratories reporting estimated glomerular filtration rate in this guideline is the Chronic regarding laboratory tests for chronic kidney disease: Creatinine, Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaborative estimated glomerular filtration rate and Urine albumin. Questions about (chronic kidney disease-EPI) equation. The requirement for the methods used, reagent manufacturers reporting estimated glomerular filtration rate by chronic kidney disease-EPI is the measurement for measuring Creatinine, equations used for of serum Creatinine by using standardised assays calculating estimated glomerular filtration rate, as well as reporting of traceable to isotope-dilution mass spectrometry estimated glomerular filtration rate were included. Regarding Urine albumin, (IDMS). Regarding the evaluation of albuminuria, information on the types of samples used for the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline recommends the following measuring, units of measurement, reference measurements for initial testing (in descending interval and the terminology used was sought. order of preference, in all cases an early morning Data received were tabulated in Microsoft Excel. Urine sample is preferred): 1) Urine albuminResults are presented as absolute numbers and to-Creatinine ratio (albumin-creatinine ratio); 2) Urine Protein-topercentages. Creatinine ratio (protein-creatinine ratio); 3) reagent strip urinalysis for total Protein with automated reading; 4) RESULTS reagent strip urinalysis for total Protein with A limitation of this study is the Low percentage of manual reading. They recommended that the laboratories that completed the survey. Only 42 of term microalbuminuria should no longer be used the 140 laboratories (30%) invited to participate by laboratories. Following the changes in the recommendations answered the questionnaire. Responses were received from four Ministry of Education hospital of reporting estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria by the 2012 laboratories, 25 Ministry of Health laboratories Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline, it was not certain whether and 13 private laboratories. laboratories in Malaysia were following the recommendations of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline Creatinine in the measurement of serum Creatinine, the laboratory reporting of estimated glomerular filtration rate and Urine albumin. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes 2012 recommended that clinical This national audit, therefore, was conducted laboratories should measure serum Creatinine to determine how estimated glomerular filtration rate and Urine albumin is using a specific assay with calibration traceable currently reported by Malaysian laboratories in to international standard reference materials comparison to current Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines. This and have minimal bias compared to isotopebackground of information would be helpful dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) reference for developing national recommendations.",
    "The methodology. Thirty-seven laboratories measured Malaysian Association of Clinical Biochemists serum Creatinine by the Jaffé method (88. 1%) and (MACB) formed a chronic kidney disease Task Force to provide the enzymatic method was used by the remaining recommendations for the laboratory reporting laboratories. Forty of the laboratories (95%) that of estimated glomerular filtration rate and Urine albumin. responded, used methods that were traceable to IDMS. In March 2011, Siemens Healthcare MATERIALS AND METHODS Diagnostics issued a technical bulletin that provided a correction factor to enable reporting of National guidelines recommending routine IDMS traceable results for the Jaffé methods used reporting of the estimated glomerular filtration rate, as well as other with Dimension and Vista analysers. 10 Five of the standardised clinical and laboratory practices, 37 laboratories (13. 5%) used correction factors have been published in a number of countries, to report serum Creatinine. Only two of these including Australia and New Zealand, Croatia, five laboratories used the appropriate correction Turkey, and the United Kingdom. 6-9 The MACB factor as recommended by the manufacturer. chronic kidney disease Task Force prepared an online survey based on questionnaires used in other countries.

    "to report estimated glomerular filtration rate in adults. An alternative to creat The audit revealed that the preferred terminology the Creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate estimating equation for 35 laboratories (83. 3%) when reporting is acceptable if it has been shown to improve Urine albumin is still microalbumin. There was the accuracy of glomerular filtration rate estimates compared to the a wide disparity regarding the preferred Urine 2009 chronic kidney disease-EPI Creatinine equation.

However, 23 laboratories (54. 8%) were estimated glomerular filtration rate was reported along with serum receiving random spot Urine samples and only Creatinine by 26 (61. 9%) of the laboratories while 11 laboratories (23. 8%) received first morning 14 (33. 3%) of the laboratories reported estimated glomerular filtration rate spot Urine samples. only on request. Two laboratories did not report Reporting units and cut-off values: estimated glomerular filtration rate at all. The most commonly used formula The recommended units for reporting albumin-creatinine ratio and for calculating estimated glomerular filtration rate was the MDRD equation. Albumin Excretion Rate (AER) are magnesium/mmol Twenty-seven (27) laboratories (64. 3%) used the and magnesium/24 hours, respectively. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes MDRD equation and 15 laboratories used the recommended normal or mild albuminuria chronic kidney disease-EPI equation in calculating estimated glomerular filtration rate. Two reference intervals for albumin-creatinine ratio and AER are 3. 0 laboratories used both the MDRD and chronic kidney disease-EPI magnesium/mmol and 30 magnesium/24 hours, respectively. equations to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate and reported both Eight laboratories (19%) reported AER and the values. The survey also enquired about formula reporting unit was in magnesium/L with no appropriate other than MDRD and chronic kidney disease-EPI that was used reference intervals. Only 23 laboratories (55%) by the laboratory to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate and one reported albumin-creatinine ratio in magnesium/mmol and 15 of the 23 lab responded stating that the Cockcroft-Gault laboratories (65%) used gender-specific reference formula was used to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate on request. intervals for albumin-creatinine ratio. The MDRD equation was developed and recommended for estimated glomerular filtration rate reporting in adults by DISCUSSION the National Kidney Disease Education Program (NKDEP) and by the Department of Health in Laboratory medicine plays an important role the UK. 12, 13 Because of imprecision at higher in the diagnosis and management of chronic kidney disease.
