ABSTRACT ARTICLE DETAILS Renal failure is the most important disease that causes losing in the efficiency of Kidney and is renal Published On: failure or may called end stage Kidney disease where capacity for Kidney become 15% less than the 18 August 2023 normal levels. This disease can be classified into two types: first (acute Kidney failure ) which may resolve and it rapidly developed. Second (chronic Kidney failure): it slowly developed and may become a permanent condition Symptoms of Renal failure include Vomiting; Edema in the legs; a loss of appetite; confusion and tiredness. Several complications occurred which include High Blood Potassium; volume overload and uremia in acute condition while Hypertension; anemia and Heart disease in the chronic condition. There are several factors that may lead to the progress of acute renal failure conditions such as hypotension, a blockage of the urinary tract, hemolytic uremic syndrome and some medications. While Diabetes, hypertension, polycystic renal disease and nephrotic syndrome represent the major causes of chronic renal failure. Signs that help in identification of acute and chronic renal failure based on mishmash of several factors and help in distinguish between its types such as increasing of Creatinine levels and decreasing of Urine production are the signs of acute failure while decrease the rate of glomerular filtration to below of 15 or therapy with renal replacement are the signs of chronic renal failure. Acute failure can be treated depending on the main causes, on the other hand may use Dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal Dialysis) or Kidney transplant in order treating chronic failure. Available on: KEYWORDS: renal failure, acute renal failure, chronic renal failure INTRODUCTION used instead of Acute Renal Failure because it is more Kidney is a vital organ in the human body which removes comprehensive. (6) Several risk factors are responsible related waste products from circulation such as nitrogenous waste to progress of acute renal failure such as anemia, and exogenous molecules, such as drugs, in addition to hypertension, infectious disease (such as malaria) regulation levels of electrolytes, participated in the synthesis, chemotherapy and sepsis. This condition represented as of erythropoietin hormone and Metabolism of proteins that lethal condition and it is more prevalent in older aged while are Low molecular weight, such as insulin. (1) according to gender it is more prevalent in men than in The incapability of the Kidney to achieve its excretion women. (7) function leads to the preservation of nitrogenous waste 2. Chronic Renal Failure (chronic renal failure): products from the circulation and this is represented as renal This kind corresponds to the advancing defeat of Kidney failure. (2) functions where the Creatinine levels increased for function Two types of renal failure: Acute and chronic renal failure. (3) of a minimum of 3 months or the analyzed glomerular 1. Acute Renal Failure (acute renal failure): estimated glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate) is below 60 ml per minute / 1. 73m2 This type is reversible and it is intimate when occur (8)and this will lead to using Dialysis or transplantation and suddenly in the Blood supply or in case of toxins overload the this condition called end-stage renal disease (end-stage renal disease)(9). kidneys and this will lead to loss of Kidney function unexpectedly(4).",
    "kidneys and this will lead to loss of Kidney function unexpectedly(4). ETIOLOGY It can be diagnosed when Creatinine level in 48 hours Several factors may cause initiation of renal failure with its elevated to 0. 3 milligrams per deciliter or to 1. 5 times limit in last 7 days along different types. with reduction the volume of Urine to below 0. 5 mL/kg per For acute renal failure: 60% of cases caused by Hypotension hour for 6 hours (5). Another term acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) is, sepsis, hemorrhage, failure of Heart or Liver, and several 1663 Volume 03 Issue 08 August 2023 Corresponding Author: Israa Harjan Mohsen Renal Failure, Types, Causes and Etiology: A Review Article drugs such as NSAIDs and cyclosporine and these factors hypertension of the glomerular capillaries lead to progress of known as Prerenal(10). chronic Kidney failure (21). Approximately 35% of cases produce from extended prerenal There is a negative charge found in the glomerular failure which brings about an episode of Acute tubule filtration membrane which acts as an obstruction that inhibits necrosis. Another causes acute interstitial nephritis, passage of anionic macromolecules and any disruption in this vasculitis, rhabdomyolysis and arteriolar insults. All these barrier leads to access for proteins across the glomerular conditions are known as Intrarenal(11) filtration (19). The rest 5% approximately represented as Postrenal may Other parts of Kidney also participate in convey abnormal result from several factors such as hypertrophy of prostate, , material to the epithelial cells of the tubular in the Kidney. tumor, calculus, carcinoma, neurogenic bladder, clot, and Generally renal failure classified into three categories: stricture. (12) First: pre-nephrotic azotemia: reduction in renal Blood flow Other causes of acute renal failure may result as a Second: Kidney azotemia: Autoimmune parenchymal Kidney complication from surgeries or injuries and accidents. Also, disease it may result from overdoses of chemicals that accumulated Third: post-renal azotemia: obstruction of Urine flow. 49; 50 from chemotherapy or antibiotics. (13) Acute Kidney failure Epidemiology may result from accidental causes known as crush syndrome In general, renal failure is more prevalent across the world in which toxins in large amounts increased suddenly in the and it prevalent in men than in women, especially the final Blood causing ischemia. It is thought that these toxins were stages of the renal disease where in the United States there initiated by the collapse of skeletal muscles such as were annually infected 100000 of people. (22) Potassium, and phosphorus and myoglobin as a consequence According to ethnicity, the final stages of Renal disease is of damaged from ischemic conditions. This condition is not prevalence 3-4 times more than whites. There were 209 fully understand but it explained as a case of nephrotoxic patients per million with acute renal insufficiency inhabitants metabolites of myoglobin. (14) annually, 36% of them required renal replacement therapy53. This type of renal failure may improve but the patient Kidney disease is more increased with Population growth needs support and treatment to acquire its normal function where the Dialysis patients were more than million and they may still be in danger of initiation of Kidney failure worldwide and annually it is reach to a quarter of a million in in the future(15). the United States (23). For Chronic Renal Failure the main causes are Diabetes The percentage of chronic Kidney disease elevated from mellitus type2 and Hypertension first common cause. (16) 12% to 14% between 1994 to 200455. The prevalence of The second common causes are Glomerulonephritis, chronic renal disease is elevated in people aged more than 65 Polycystic Kidney diseases and Renal vascular diseases.",
    "in the United States of America for time between 2000 and Other identified causes, such as nephrolithiasis, persistent 200856. The percentage of frequency of Kidney disease in obstruction of the urinary tract, Vesicoureteral reflux, African Americans is 3 times higher than in Caucasians (24). pyelonephritis, and Recurrent Kidney infections. (17) The main cause of Kidney disease is Hypertension Other causes include over doses of some drugs such as and Diabetes. Throughout the years, indicated a gradual ibuprofen, and paracetamol or infection with some viruses elevation in the number of people suffering from Diabetes that attack of Kidney such as Hantavirus. 43 44Some patients and 44% of these patients entering the end stage of renal suffering from chronic Kidney failure as a result of hereditary failure (ESRF). Cystic nephritis and glomerulonephritis is predisposition where APOL1 gene optimizes the major gene also relatively constant as a cause of end-stage renal disease. that is responsible for the incidence of chronic renal failure in Diabetes is the main cause of Kidney disease, which is in its patients who dont have Diabetes(18) final stages all over the world and in both developed and Pathophysiology developing countries (25). The occurrence of renal failure in At the first time several events occur during acute renal its final stages in Australia was additionally affected by: failure and over time gradually progress to chronic renal Diabetes was about 25%(26), and in the European Union, was failure (19) about 15% _33%, while patients who were affected because The Blood flow in the renal tissues at a rate greater than of glomerulonephritis was about 9% -20%(27)There are many the amount of Blood circulation that streams into the Liver possible causes that cause chronic kidney disease in Africa that make Kidney, brain and Heart where the rate of Blood reachs to 400 ml /100 disease stressful, but in addition to infectious and nongrams of tissue per minute, so it is exposed to large amounts infectious diseases such as leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, of harmful substances (20). infectious glomerulonephritis, and HIV infection, which is The main section that signifies the major steps in the normal frequent and cause chronic kidney disease, and that is because nearly more function of the Kidney is Glomerular filtration, where acts on than 22 million who are infected with HIV in sub-Saharan filtration of Blood from the circulatory with its downloaded Africa which creates the enormous burden of chronic kidney disease. Chronic substances such as toxins and salts and the hyperfiltration or Kidney disease continues to appear to be a chronic disease in the world (28). 1664 Volume 03 Issue 08 August 2023 Corresponding Author: Israa Harjan Mohsen Renal Failure, Types, Causes and Etiology: A Review Article Conclusion: Renal failure is lethal condition and it is more unastankukroničnogzatajenjabubrega The role of prevalence in the world.
