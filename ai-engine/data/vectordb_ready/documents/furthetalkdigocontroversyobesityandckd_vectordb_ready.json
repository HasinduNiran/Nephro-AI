In October 2024, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) held a Controversies Conference on Obesity and chronic kidney disease to examine the most recent evidence regarding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of obesity and chronic kidney disease as well as to articulate priorities for research. A key conference theme was increasing awareness of obesity-related f o chronic kidney disease. Long-term, early onset obesity as well as prolonged exposure to obesity carry the greatest o risk of developing chronic kidney disease. Identifying early biomarkers of Kidney dysfunction and refining r p assessment methods in the context of obesity could provide opportunities for preventing loss of - e Kidney function. The foundation for managing obesity in chronic kidney disease comprises modifications to diet, r P physical activity level, and behaviors related to both. However, these strategies can be unsuccessful in achieving or maintaininlg weight loss for a myriad of reasons. Pharmacotherapies a n such as those including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are effective in weight r reduction and have been suhown to have Kidney-protective and cardiovascular benefits. Metabolic o and bariatric surgery has also demonstrated benefits in reducing obesity-related complications. J Appropriateness and choice of management strategies will vary depending on age and comorbidities and may change over time. Patient-lead goal setting is a foundation for dietary and physical activity interventions focusing on incremental, achievable changes towards healthy eating and an active lifestyle. Healthcare professionals require training to deliver these interventions and provide ongoing support with positive messaging using non-judgmental, stigma-free language. Evaluating the optimal duration of therapy, long-term safety of novel pharmacotherapies, and therapies in the context of early and later stages of chronic kidney disease are key priorities for research. Multidisciplinary collaboration is important both for optimizing patient care and advancing research. 3 INTRODUCTION Obesity is a complex chronic disease with multiple contributing factors, including environment, genetics, and social determinants of health. The prevalence of obesity in both adults and children is increasing, and it is expected that by 2035 more than 1. 5 billion people will live with obesity. 1 In parallel, chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease), which affects more than 800 million people globally, is also on the rise, both in prevalence and as a leading cause of f o mortality. 2, 3 Obesity is a driver for development of type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and hypertension, the o two leading causes of chronic kidney disease in most countries. 4 In addition, orbesity per se may lead to chronic kidney disease p directly. 5, 6 Adipose tissue may also affect the kidneys through production of adipokines, - e hormones that regulate inflammation and glucose metabolism, as well as through dysfunctional r P lipid metabolism, and each of these processes can contribute to chronic kidney disease. 4 l Treating obesity with optimaized diet and physical activity is preferred but often n unsuccessful for a myriad of reasons. 7, 8 For example, reductions in weight are often not r u sustained. In recent years, trials evaluating metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) or o pharmacological interventions have demonstrated positive outcomes, 9-11 with substantial J reductions in weight that are maintained after MBS or with continued pharmacotherapy.",
    "It has been suggested that interventions leading to weight loss can reduce progression of chronic kidney disease, as evaluated either by proxy through reduction in albuminuria, or directly through preservation of Kidney function (i. e. , estimated glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate estimated glomerular filtration rate). The interpretation of estimated glomerular filtration rate changes in the context of changing weight is complicated, however, since the biomarker Creatinine, used in estimated glomerular filtration rate equations, is impacted by muscle mass and diet, and weight loss inevitably results in loss of some lean body mass. 12, 13 4 In October 2024, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes held a Controversies Conference on the Relationship Between Obesity and chronic kidney disease: Pathophysiology, Prognosis, and Management. Participants discussed current evidence and controversies regarding epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis as well as the optimal means for addressing obesity in chronic kidney disease with respect to nutrition, physical activity, pharmacological treatments, and MBS to meet person-centered needs in diverse populations. The format of the conference involved topical plenary session presentations (available on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes f o website: Disease: Improving Global Outcomes. org/conferences/chronic kidney disease-obesity/) followed by focused discussion groups. o Participants included 51 healthcare professionals and 3 patiernts. Key clinical issues and priorities p for research were identified (Table 1). - e r P EPIDEMIOLOGY OF OBESITY AND chronic kidney disease AND ASSOCIATED RISKS l Current evidence shows that obesitya, a chronic disease, has reached pandemic proportions. Since n 1990, the prevalence of adult obesity worldwide has more than doubled, and adolescent obesity r u has quadrupled. In 2022, 2. 5 billion people (43% of the population over 18 years) were o overweight, and 1 in 8 people were living with obesity. 14 Similarly, 390 million children and J adolescents aged 519 years were overweight in 2022, including 160 million living with obesity. 15 Thirty-seven million children under the age of 5 years were overweight. The prevalences of both overweight and obesity generally increase with age, reaching a peak between the ages of 50 to 65 years and thereafter showing a slight downward trend. The prevalence of obesity is higher in women than in men of any age. 16 The age-standardized prevalence of obesity in adults has increased in 188 countries (94%) for women and in all except one country for men, but with distinct differences across countries. 17 5 The long-term effects of obesity on the risk of chronic kidney disease and adverse cardiovascular outcomes are multifaceted and well-documented in both adults and children. 5 The strongest evidence for this link comes from studies with long observation periods (up to 30 years) in children or young adults with obesity, demonstrating a clear connection to Kidney disease18 and adverse cardiac function. 19 A High body mass index (body mass index) is a well-recognized and strong independent predictor of f o the risk of chronic kidney disease and Kidney failure, even after adjustments for baseline Blood Hypertension level and o presence or absence of T2D. 20 A graded association has beenr shown between the degree of p baseline body mass index and the risk of Kidney failure in a global meta-analysis of over five million adults - e (including representation from multiple Asian countries), 21 as well as in a large communityr P based sample of individuals in the United States. 20 In a study of a community-based cohort of l 2, 585 men and women from the Fraamingham Offspring Study with long-term follow-up (mean n 18. 5 years), each unit increase in body mass index was associated with a 1.",
    "5 years), each unit increase in body mass index was associated with a 1. 23-fold increased risk for newr u onset Kidney disease (as assessed by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation o and defined as glomerular filtration rate 59. 3 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2 for women and 64. 3 for men), with the lowest J risk for those with a body mass index in the normal range and a higher risk for those at either High or Low extremes of body mass index. 22 For each body mass index category, obesity in women was associated with higher health risks than in men (respiratory rate 1. 92 vs 1. 49), including a higher risk of Kidney cancers (pooled respiratory rate 1. 87 vs 1. 53). 23 Obesity affects 1 in 5 children worldwide. 24 A recent meta-analysis of 2033 studies in 45 million children from 154 different countries or regions showed that the prevalence of obesity was 8. 5% and overweight was 14. 8%, with distinct regional differences. 24 Since 1980 the prevalence of obesity has continuously increased and doubled in over 70 countries, with the rate 6 of increase in childhood obesity greater than the rate of increase in adult obesity. 25 Lifecourse trajectories of body mass index suggest that nearly 50% of children are on an increasing body mass index trajectory with 5% on a decreasing trajectory. 26 The increasing prevalence of obesity in children raises the spectre of increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the future. Importantly, there is evidence that prolonged exposure to overweight during adult life increases the risk of later chronic kidney disease in a cumulative manner. 27 A f o population-based, prospective study showed that people with overweight beginning early in o adulthood (by ages 26 or 36 years) had approximately doublre the odds of developing chronic kidney disease by p age 6064 years compared with those who first became overweight at age 6064 years or never - e became overweight, with the strength of this association decreasing with increasing age of first r P overweight. 27 l At a population level, the praevalence of obesity is higher in populations with chronic kidney disease G5 n (estimated glomerular filtration rate 15 milliliters per minute per 1. 73m2) versus age-matched general populations, showing the association r u between obesity and Kidney failure. An approximately two-fold higher increase in body mass index was o reported in patients with incident Kidney failure compared with the age-matched ultrasound J population. 28 Controversy remains as to the extent and nature of this association, however, as some studies suggest that body mass index has a U-shaped or J-shaped association with chronic kidney disease progression, with the lowest incidence observed in people with overweight and mild obesity. 29, 30 In exploring the causes of the obesity epidemic and risks for development of chronic kidney disease, environmental and societal factors are potentially important. Some have suggested that the exposomewhich includes factors such as global warming, air pollution, health disparities, microplastics, and lack of clean Waterexacerbates the synergistic interactions of environmental factors with chronic diseases such as obesity and chronic kidney disease. 31-33 Future research on the impacts of 7 strategies combining policy and clinical care pathways may increase knowledge on developing effective interventions to prevent the growing population burden of obesity-related chronic kidney disease. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY LINKING OBESITY AND chronic kidney disease The progression from metabolic disruptions to development of obesity, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular events and reduced life expectancy can be conceptualized as a metabolic domino f o effect (Figure 1).",
    "The complete details of this pathophysiologic progression are an important o area of future study to identify areas for targeted interventionrs and preventive measures. T2D p and Blood Hypertension account for most of the risk associated with adiposity and chronic kidney disease. 34 Chronic - e hypoxia has been proposed as the primary pathophysiological pathway driving chronic kidney disease caused by r P T2D or other etiologies. Glomerular hyperfiltration, mitochondrial exhaustion, and a mismatch l between oxygen delivery and oxygean demand may contribute to a cycle of hypoxic injury, n glomerular loss, and progressive nephropathy (Figure 2). 35 Other metabolic alterations include r u inflammation, activation of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS), oxidative stress, o dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, lipotoxicity, gut dysbiosis, changes in adipokines, Sodium and J fluid retention, and the influence of obesogenic drugs. Adipose tissue accumulation in the Kidney and Liver positively correlates with increasing body mass index, Urine albumin-to-Creatinine ratio (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio), and triglycerides and negatively correlates with estimated glomerular filtration rate. 36 In addition to metabolic effects, the adipose tissue may also compromise Kidney function by physical compression of the kidneys. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted strategies to mitigate chronic kidney disease risk in patients with obesity and improve overall Kidney health. 37 The causal relationship between systemic inflammation and chronic kidney disease is still being clarified. Ongoing trials investigating the effects of targeted IL-6 inhibitors, such as clazakizumab38 and 8 ziltivekimab, 39 in people with chronic kidney disease with or without obesity may inform whether inflammation has a causal role in disease progression. Systemic inflammation is known to play an important role as a modifier of the paradoxical association between higher body mass index and lower mortality in people undergoing hemodialysis. 40 Genetic factors also influence the association between adiposity and chronic kidney disease. Modeling based on Mendelian randomization analysis of UK Biobank data showed an effect of selected f o loci on the association of both general and central adiposity with chronic kidney disease, although genetics o appeared to be a weaker mediator of adiposity and chronic kidney disease thanr Diabetes or Blood Hypertension. 34 p Studies of genetic and environmental interactions will further our understanding of these - e complex relationships. r P l EVALUATION OF ADIPOSITYa AND ASSESSMENT OF Kidney FUNCTION IN n PEOPLE WITH OBESITY r u Anthropometric measures of obesity o Despite the substantial evidence of an increasing prevalence of obesity and the importance of its J associations with chronic kidney disease, there is currently no gold standard assessment for obesity among people with chronic kidney disease. body mass index is the most widely utilized and available tool; however, relying solely on body mass index can be misleading, and body mass index cut-off values are not universal, with body mass index 25 kg/m2 used among Asians versus 30 kg/m2 for others. 41 There is evidence that distribution of body fat, not obesity as defined by body mass index per se, is related to a variety of physiological aberrations, such as hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerosis. Moreover, the risk of estimated glomerular filtration rate decline has been correlated with measures of central adiposity and the cardiovascular Kidneymetabolic (CKM) syndrome more so than with body mass index. 42 Individuals with central fat 9 distribution, regardless of body mass index, have a demonstrated greater risk for diminished estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria, with a graded association with increasing waist-hip ratio.",
    "43 Conversely, in a population of 1, 261 middle-aged persons (median age 59 years) without T2D, cardiovascular disease, or Kidney disease, the presence of metabolic syndrome was an independent risk factor for accelerated age-related decline in iohexol glomerular filtration rate over a median of 5. 6 years, with a 0. 30 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2 per year faster mean glomerular filtration rate decline, which was primarily driven by elevated f o triglyceride levels noted in metabolic syndrome. 44 A recently released consensus statement by o the Lancet Commission on Definition and Diagnostic Criterira for Clinical Obesity41 recommends p the use of body mass index only for population-level studies. It also recommends assessing excess adiposity - e at an individual level, either via direct measure of visceral organ adiposity or use of another r P anthropometric measure (such as WC, waist-to-hip ratio WHR, or weight-to-height ratio), l along with body mass index. This statement diffaerentiates preclinical and clinical obesity, which has n therapeutic implications. The diagnosis of clinical obesity requires one or both of the following r u main criteria: 1) evidence of reduced organ or tissue function due to obesity (i. e. , signs, o symptoms, or diagnostic tests showing abnormalities in the function of one or more tissue or J organ system) or 2) substantial, age-adjusted limitations of daily activities reflecting the specific effect of obesity on mobility, other basic activities of daily living (e. g. , bathing, dressing, toileting, continence, and eating), or both. Those who fit the definition of clinical obesity would need urgent interventions to prevent adverse consequences. Future studies should assess the impact of using various combinations of anthropometrics on clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease. Several measures have been used to study the adverse consequences of adiposity on Kidney function or incident chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in those with preexisting Kidney disease. 45 The advantages and limitations of these measures for clinical practice 10 are described in Table 2. WC and WHR were identified as risk factors for estimated glomerular filtration rate decline and death in individuals who have normal or reduced levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate. However, reported associations between body mass index, WC, and Kidney disease progression and mortality have been discordant, 46, 47 warranting evaluation of adiposity using body composition studies. An additional challenge of using anthropometric measurements is that High fluid retention and hypervolemia can distort not only body weight but also interfere with the accuracy and reliability of assessing obesity. For f o individuals, changes in body mass index over time may not fully represent an increase in adipose tissue48, 49 o given the influence of multiple factors (such as fluid overloard) on body mass index in those with chronic kidney disease. p - e Clinical phenotypes of obesity r P Multiple body composition subtypes (visceral and subcutaneous obesity) and clinical l phenotypes of obesity (e. g. , sarcopeanic obesity) have been identified in the general population. n Even though differential risks of individual obesity subtypes with clinical outcomes have been r reported, 50-53 there is curr u ently no well-established diagnostic criterion or consensus on the use of o appropriate diagnostic modalities for identifying such subtypes, and therefore further studies are J warranted. Visceral obesity has been identified as an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease and associated with inflammation and adipokines in chronic kidney disease. 51 However, radiological evaluation may be needed to evaluate visceral obesity in several situations, although this may not be universally feasible.",
    "52, 54 Sarcopenic obesity, a clinical condition characterized by the co-occurrence of excess adipose tissue and loss of skeletal muscle mass, 55 is associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease and affects 223% of the chronic kidney disease population. 53, 56 There is a lack of consensus on the definitions of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity, with considerable differences among diagnostic criteria, 11 methodologies, and cut-off values. Nonetheless, the clinical consequences of sarcopenic obesity are considerably worse than those for either sarcopenia or obesity. 57 Metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) refers to the presence of obesity in the absence of common metabolic risk factors. A large meta-analysis (n 4, 965, 285 participants) illustrated a statistically significant association between risk of chronic kidney disease and the phenotypes of being metabolically healthy overweight (respiratory rate: 1. 29; 95% CI: 1. 271. 32, P 0. 001) or obese (respiratory rate: f o 1. 47; 95% CI: 1. 311. 65, P 0. 001), 50 suggesting both preclinical and clinical obesity (in the o absence of metabolic risk factors) is harmful, with additive erffects for metabolic risk factors in p addition to obesity. - e Kidney function assessment in obesity r P Accurate assessment of Kidney function is often challenging in people with obesity and l remains a subject of debate. Gold staandard assessment tools including exogeneous glomerular n filtration markers such as iothalamate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, diethylene triamine r u pentaacetic acid, and iohexol, are relatively expensive, inconvenient, and time-consuming and o are therefore rarely utilized in clinical practice. 58, 59 Serum Creatinine and cystatin C, two J endogenous molecules, are widely used to assess estimated glomerular filtration rate; however, their accuracy in glomerular filtration rate estimation is unclear among patients with extreme obesity (Figure 3). 60 Reliability of these measures in individuals undergoing weight loss also merits further studies. There has been debate about the utility of indexing to body surface area (BSA), which has direct implications for chronic kidney disease staging and drug dosing. There is a lack of validation of BSAestimating formulas (non-indexed) in people with obesity, and indexing has the potential to mask glomerular hyperfiltration among people with obesity. 61 In an analysis of 3, 611 participants from the CRIC (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort) Study, increases in obesity-associated BSA were 12 accompanied by higher absolute glomerular filtration rate for a given estimated glomerular filtration rate. 62 This was further evaluated in a study of 4, 707 persons referred for measured glomerular filtration rate with a range of BMIs. 63 Analysis of indexed and non-indexed estimated glomerular filtration rate using Creatinine, cystatin C and the combination concluded that indexed eGFRcr-cys was more accurate than indexed eGFRcr across the body mass index spectrum. Using nonindexed eGFRcr-cys further improved accuracy for some treatment decisions. Studies comparing the effectiveness of indexed or unindexed glomerular filtration rate for the prediction of long-term chronic kidney diseasef o related clinical outcomes including chronic kidney disease progression, major adverse cardiovascular events, or o mortality, are needed. r p Albuminuria assessment in obesity - e The presence of albuminuria is a well-studied and acknowledged risk factor for chronic kidney disease. r P However, when assessing urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in the setting of obesity, it is important to remember that l urinary Creatinine excretion is a direact reflection of muscle mass. This can be particularly n problematic in sarcopenic obesity and in those undergoing weight loss. 64 A mild-to-moderate r u change in urinary Creatinine excretion can lead to an underor overestimation of spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio if o urinary albumin remains constant.",
    "64 Although determining a lower threshold for urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio may J appear as a solution, such an approach may be misleading among people with sarcopenic obesity. Issues Relating to Kidney Transplant In people with Kidney failure, including those living with obesity, Kidney transplantation provides survival benefits over Dialysis therapy. 65-67 However, obesity is associated with lower access to Kidney transplantation as evidenced by lower rates for referral, longer wait times, and lower rates of transplantation. 68 Relative to individuals with a body mass index of 18. 525 kg/m2, individuals with body mass index ≥35 kg/m2 are less likely to be listed for receiving a Kidney transplant, especially among individuals 45 years old, women, or those of Asian race. 69 13 The rationale for this diminished access is the documented higher risk for surgical complications (i. e. , longer procedure period and warm ischemia time, higher risk for surgical-site infections, dehiscence, vascular complications including venous thromboembolism) and postoperative complications (i. e. , delayed graft function, acute rejection). 70 However, whether these risks outweigh the known benefits of transplantation over Dialysis remains somewhat controversial. Obesity treatment should be considered prior to transplantation, mediated via f o pharmacotherapy or MBS to facilitate timely access to Kidney transplant and potentially improve o long-term metabolic risks. However, more data in this area arre needed. Multiple studies, mostly p retrospective with small sample sizes and short follow-up periods, reported potential benefits of - e intentional weight loss prior to transplantation among Kidney transplant candidates with r P obesity, 71-73 but larger-scale, prospective clinical studies investigating this highly relevant issue l for clinical practice are needed. It isa noted that after MBS, maintaining adequate n immunosuppression levels after transplantation can be challenging. 74 r u o INTERVENTIONS FOR WEIGHT LOSS AND IMPROVING Kidney FUNCTION J Tailored diet and physical activity interventions should be a foundation of therapy in people living with obesity and chronic kidney disease. Also integral to management are behavioral therapy and consideration of obesity-management medications and surgical interventions. The mechanisms by which weight loss affects Kidney outcomes are unclear and may be direct or indirect. Weight change should be considered alongside changes in clinical and patient-reported outcomes, including Kidney function, quality of life, Blood Hypertension, functional capacity, and measures of diet quality. Diet and Exercise 14 Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported the effectiveness and safety of reduced energy intake and increased physical activity to achieve weight loss and improved functional capacity in people living with obesity and chronic kidney disease. 7, 75 However, studies have not consistently shown evidence that behavioral interventions to reduce intake improve metabolic outcomes including Blood Hypertension, albuminuria, and Blood lipids, possibly due to small sample size, short follow-up, or study heterogeneity. 7 Studies addressing Kidney outcomes in populations at High f o risk of chronic kidney disease have shown that diet and physical activity interventions can reduce the incidence of o reaching a High-risk chronic kidney disease category (orange in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes hreat map76) and slow estimated glomerular filtration rate decline. 77p 80 Successful interventions, which include dietary modification and physical exercise, - e incorporate elements of behavioral therapy. In a secondary analysis of the LOOK-AHEAD r P (Action for Health in Diabetes) RCT, participants with T2D and obesity who received intensive l lifestyle intervention achieved a 9%a reduction in body weight versus 6% in the usual education n group. 77 This was accompanied by a 31% reduced risk of incident veryHigh-risk chronic kidney disease based on r the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes heat map (ha u zard ratio heart rate 0.",
    "69, 95% confidence interval CI 0. 55-0. 87). 76, 77 In a o secondary analysis of the CORDIOPREV (CORonary Diet Intervention with Olive Oil and J cardiovascular PREVention) RCT, participants with T2D and obesity randomized to a Mediterranean diet had less decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate than those randomly assigned to a Low-fat diet, independent of weight loss. 79 In the PREDIMED-Plus (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterráneaPlus) RCT, participants with CKM syndrome randomly assigned to an energy-reduced Mediterranean diet along with physical activity recommendations and behavioral support had a 40% lower incidence of moderately or severely impaired estimated glomerular filtration rate (heart rate 0. 60; 95% CI 0. 440. 82), and 92% higher reversion of moderately to mildly impaired estimated glomerular filtration rate (heart rate 1. 92; 95% CI 1. 352. 73), when compared with a control group with education about a Mediterranean diet. 80 15 Table 3 summarizes the key studies on dietary interventions for obesity management, including suggestions regarding suitability at different stages of chronic kidney disease and evidence gaps in certain populations. 77, 80-88 Dietary and physical activity interventions focusing on incremental, achievable changes towards healthy eating and an active lifestyle with positive messaging and ongoing support can be implemented using patient-led goal setting. 86, 89 Healthcare professionals require training to deliver these interventions using non-judgmental, stigma-free language and f o approaches. 90 o Obesity Management Medications r p Several medications are currently licensed with an indication for obesity treatment, and, - e of these, incretin mimetics have the most available data with respect to Kidney outcomes. Incretin r P mimetics currently licensed or in development include glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists l (GLP-1 RA), glucose-dependent insaulinotropic polypeptide receptor agonists (GIP RA), and n combinations of these including triple combinations with glucagon receptor agonists and r u antagonists. At present GLP-1 RA and dual GLP-1/GIP RA have the most data to inform o managing obesity in people with or without Kidney diseases. 91 In people with chronic kidney disease, these have J shown efficacy for weight reduction with an absence of chronic kidney disease-specific safety signals. 92-95 Of note, trials including participants with chronic kidney disease excluded transplant recipients, and many excluded people with estimated glomerular filtration rate 30 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2. Dialysis and transplantation are not listed as contraindications to using GLP-1 RA or GLP-1 RA plus other peptides, although there is a lack of evidence of Kidney benefits in patients with glomerular filtration rate 15 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2 (including those on Dialysis). Emerging retrospective data indicate potential Kidney benefits in Kidney transplantation, tested mostly in transplant recipients with T2D, 96, 97 but RCTs are needed. 16 An important question is whether obesity management medications are, in practice, used long enough to benefit Kidney health. Lack of adherence and non-persistence with treatment are important barriers; 98 in some real-world studies, non-adherence is as High as 60%. 99, 100 Important barriers to accessibility for GLP-1 RA are cost and payer preparedness. 101 There is a need for trial and real-world data in this population to inform strategies for realizing potential benefits of medication. f o Effects of incretin-based therapies on the Kidney o To date the only trial of incretin-based therapy with a kidneyr primary endpoint was the FLOW p (Evaluate Renal Function with Semaglutide Once Weekly) trial. The FLOW trial examined - e semaglutide 1. 0 magnesium weekly in people with T2D and chronic kidney disease. 93 Prior transplant, Kidney replacement r P therapy, or an estimated glomerular filtration rate 25 milliliters per minute per 1.",
    "93 Prior transplant, Kidney replacement r P therapy, or an estimated glomerular filtration rate 25 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2 were exclusion criteria. Overall, 400 of 3, 533 total l participants had estimated glomerular filtration rate 30 ml/mina per 1. 73 m2. The primary outcome comprised Kidney failure n (Dialysis, transplantation, or estimated glomerular filtration rate 15 milliliters per minute per 1. 73m2), ≥ 50% estimated glomerular filtration rate reduction from r u baseline, or Kidney or cardiovascular death. Relative to placebo, semaglutide was associated with o an overall 24% reduction in the primary outcome and a 21% reduction (heart rate: 0. 79; 95% CI: 0. 66 J 0. 94) in a composite outcome of Kidney-specific components. There was no significant variation in this effect based on estimated glomerular filtration rate category at baseline. The mean annual estimated glomerular filtration rate slope was 1. 2 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2 less with semaglutide relative to placebo (P 0. 001). The benefits on slope were seen both for calculations using Creatinine as well when using cystatin C to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate. The data from FLOW were consistent with prior secondary analyses from trials of semaglutide and other GLP-1 RA in people with T2D. A meta-analysis including data from seven trials reported a 21% reduction (P 0. 001) in the composite Kidney outcome (Table 4). This composite consisted of development of severely increased albuminuria, doubling of serum 17 Creatinine, or either at least 40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate, Kidney replacement therapy, or death due to Kidney disease. Trial-specific effect estimates ranged from a 12% reduction of the composite outcome in EXSCEL (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering) to a 36% reduction in SUSTAIN-6 (Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes), indicating a class effect. 92 For incretin-based therapies, to date the largest study with Kidney outcome data in the f o absence of T2D come from the SELECT (Semaglutide Effects on Cardiovascular Outcomes in o People With Overweight or Obesity) trial. The SELECT triarl included people with overweight p and obesity and prior cardiovascular disease but without T2D at baseline. 94 Patients undergoing - e hemodialysis or peritoneal Dialysis and individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate 15 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2 were r P excluded. Among enrolled participants, 11% (1908/17, 604) had an estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 l m2 at study entry, with just 26 persoans having an estimated glomerular filtration rate 30 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2. Semaglutide n 2. 4 magnesium subcutaneous weekly was associated with a 20% reduction in the primary endpoint of r u first occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) compared with placebo. o The reduction in risk of MACE with semaglutide was similar in those with and without estimated glomerular filtration rate J 60 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2 and in those with and without albuminuria at entry. 102 For Kidney outcomes in SELECT, semaglutide 2. 4 magnesium subcutaneous weekly was associated with a 22% reduction in the prespecified composite Kidney endpoint (heart rate: 0. 78; 95% CI: 0. 630. 96; P 0. 02). The treatment difference of 2. 19 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2 in estimated glomerular filtration rate at 104 weeks of the trial was greatest in the 11% who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2 at baseline (95% CI: 1. 003. 38; P 0. 001).",
    "73 m2 at baseline (95% CI: 1. 003. 38; P 0. 001). While treatment discontinuations in both treatment arms were more common in patients with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2, a lower number of serious adverse events were reported in those taking semaglutide versus placebo. 18 There was no evidence of increased safety signals in more frail individuals or those with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate in FLOW and SELECT, respectively, though there were few persons with estimated glomerular filtration rate 25 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2 in the trials and none with Kidney replacement therapy. In both trials there was a transient initial fall in estimated glomerular filtration rate with semaglutide. In SELECT this was a net 1. 33 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2 per year greater decline in patients randomized to semaglutide, but by week 20, estimated glomerular filtration rate was similar in both treatment arms overall. There was no increase in albuminuria during this f o period. o A recent meta-analysis of GLP-1 RA phase 3 and 4 trrials95 that included SELECT and p FLOW reported an overall reduction across all trials of GLP-1 RA combined in the composite - e Kidney outcome by 18% compared with placebo (heart rate 0. 82, 95% CI 0. 73-0. 93; I2 26. 41%), and r P a reduction in Kidney failure of 16% (heart rate 0. 84, 95% CI 0. 72-0. 99). The combined endpoint in l that analysis excluded albuminuria aand was restricted to Kidney failure (i. e. , Kidney replacement n therapy or a persistent estimated glomerular filtration rate 15 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2), a sustained reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate from r u baseline by 50% or more, or death due to Kidney disease. o Semaglutide was tested in a smaller study (n101) dedicated to patients with overweight J or obesity and chronic Kidney disease without Diabetes in a trial with albuminuria as primary endpoint. 103 Compared with the group receiving placebo, the group treated with semaglutide 2. 4 magnesium had 52. 1% lower urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (95% confidence interval 65. 5, 33. 4; P 0. 0001) at 24 weeks. Fewer data are available for tirzepatide, dual GLP-1 RA and GIP RA. A secondary analysis of the SURPASS (A Study of Tirzepatide LY3298176) Once a Week Versus Insulin Glargine Once a Day in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes)-4 open-label trial of tirzepatide versus insulin glargine in individuals with T2D reported a lesser fall in estimated glomerular filtration rate with tirzepatide on Kidney outcomes (data pooled across three doses 5, 10, 15 magnesium). 104 Further analysis showed this 19 was the case whether estimated glomerular filtration rate was estimated using measures of cystatin C or Creatinine. 105 There was also an initial transient fall in estimated glomerular filtration rate with tirzepatide as seen with semaglutide. A recent pooled analysis across SURPASS trials 1-5 found no difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate between tirzepatide and pooled comparators at week 40/42. 106 However, reductions in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio were 19%, 22%, and 26% for tirzepatide 5, 10, or 15 magnesium, respectively, compared with all pooled comparators. Longer-term data for tirzepatide will be available from the forthcoming SURPASS-CVOT (A Study of f o Tirzepatide LY3298176 Compared With Dulaglutide on Major Cardiovascular Events in o Participants With Type 2 Diabetes; NCT04255433) trial duer to report in 2025. p Cotadutide combines GLP-1 RA and glucagon RA.",
    "In a small phase 2B study in people - e with T2D and chronic kidney disease, cotadutide showed significant reductions in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio relative to standard of r P care. 107 l Retatrutide is a triple combianation of GLP-1 RA, GIP RA, and glucagon RA for which an n analysis of 2 phase 2 trialsone in people with obesity and the other in those with T2Dhas r been done. 108 In the evalu u ation in participants with T2D, at 36 weeks there was no observed o difference in creatinine-estimated glomerular filtration rate between retatrutide and placebo, though urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was significantly reduced J with retatrutide. In the trials of participants with obesity, at 48 weeks retatrutide was associated with increased creatinine-estimated glomerular filtration rate and decreased urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio compared with placebo. For dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, a systematic review found that only one study out of five trials with Kidney data indicated a reduced risk of composite microvascular outcome and albuminuria progression. 109 Mediation analyses of incretin mimetic therapies have noted that weight loss did not fully explain the Kidney benefits. Thus, it is unclear if interventions such as medications benefit 20 Kidney health in the absence of weight loss and whether there should be a target weight or other outcome measure used in people with chronic kidney disease. Non-incretin medications used in obesity Orlistat is a lipase inhibitor that reduces the absorption of dietary fat. A small, open-label study in people with chronic kidney disease and body mass index 30 or 28 kg/m2 with comorbid conditions (T2D, hypertension, or dyslipidemia) found that the weight loss in the group that received orlistat f o together with individualized support and exercise prescription was associated with a slower o decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate than in the usual-care group (without weigrht management). 110 However, the p authors noted that this result might have been affected by sampling bias. Additionally, concerns - e about acute Kidney injury and oxalate nephropathy with orlistat have been raised, 111 leading to a r P label warning to monitor Kidney function in patients at risk for Kidney insufficiency and to l discontinue the drug if oxalate nepharopathy develops. n Phentermine is a Schedule IV controlled stimulant that is indicated for weight reduction r u in the United States, but for short-term use only, and it is not indicated in children. The label o advises caution when used in people with Kidney impairment. Naltrexone/bupropion is an opioid J receptor antagonist also used for weight loss, although it is contraindicated in persons with Kidney failure. Other therapies with known Kidney benefits but not licensed as obesity drugs Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have beneficial effects on cardiovascular and Kidney outcomes in people with and without chronic kidney disease. 112 Metanalyses across all SGLT2 inhibitor trials suggest modest weight lossa mean weight reduction of 1. 79 kg (95% CI: 1. 93 to 1. 66, P 0. 001)compared with placebo. 113 In several studies it has been noted 21 that GLP-1 RA effects on Kidney outcomes are independent of and show no interaction with background SGLT2 inhibitor use. 114 Pediatric populations In the United States, semaglutide, liraglutide, orlistat (120 magnesium), and phentermine topiramate have been approved as obesity management medications for adolescents ≥ 12 years of age and weighing ≥ 60 kg with an initial body mass index corresponding to 30 kg/m2 or greater for adults. f o In contrast, only liraglutide and semaglutide have been approved for this age group in Europe.",
    "f o In contrast, only liraglutide and semaglutide have been approved for this age group in Europe. o Data on the impact of obesity management medications on kridney outcomes in children are p lacking. In the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) TEENS trial, in - e adolescents with obesity or with overweight and at least one weight-related coexisting condition, r P semaglutide was associated with a net difference of 16. 7 percentage points (95% CI 20. 3 to l 13. 2; P 0. 001) in body mass index. Data on aeGFR or albuminuria were not reported. 115 n Surgical Interventions r u Prior to the relatively recent introduction of incretin mimetic therapies, surgical o interventions for obesity were one of the few therapies which had shown promise in yielding J sustainable weight loss. The most commonly performed MBSs are sleeve gastrectomy or Rouxen-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Overall, surgical weight loss has been shown to be both relatively safe and effective to induce weight loss in people with Kidney disease and associated with improved Kidney outcomes in individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2. Relative to RYGB, sleeve gastrectomy has advantages of not being associated with Kidney stones or oxalate nephropathy and not interfering with absorption of immunosuppressive medications after Kidney transplantation. 116 22 Prior studies suggested that weight loss following MBS may decrease glomerular hyperfiltration as indicated by decreases in glomerular filtration rate (both estimated and measured) in people with estimated glomerular filtration rate 120 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2. However, the arbitrary definition of hyperfiltration as glomerular filtration rate 120 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2 can be problematic. In a retrospective, propensity-matched analysis comparing 985 people who underwent MBS with 985 who did not undergo surgery (33% of each group had baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate 90 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2), MBS was associated with a 58% lower risk f o for estimated glomerular filtration rate decline and a 57% lower risk of doubling of serum Creatinine or Kidney failure over a o median follow-up of 3. 8 years. 117 r p chronic kidney disease G5 and G5D. Patients with Kidney failure on Dialysis experience a higher incidence of - e post-MBS complications compared with those without Kidney disease; however, the absolute r P complication rates are Low relative to benefit and are not MBS-specific. 118 In a retrospective l propensity matched analysis of 717a, 809 patients spanning 2015-2019, the cumulative risk of n death within 30 days after MBS was approximately 0. 6% in 5, 817 chronic kidney disease patients (versus 0. 2% r for those without chronic kidney disease. 11u9 Current evidence suggests that MBS before Kidney transplantation o does not lead to adverse outcomes post-transplantation; however, robust evidence in this area is J lacking. 120 When MBS is performed, exercise training before and after is critical for preserving both muscle mass and fitness, as sarcopenia, and especially Low muscle strength, are associated with a High risk of complications, including cardiovascular events and mortality, in patients on hemodialysis. 121, 122 Pediatric populations. In many countries MBS is either not permitted or is permissible only in rare situations in children and adolescents with obesity. In the United States, MBS is recognized by the American Academy of Pediatrics as an effective treatment for severe obesity in 23 childhood. 123 Sleeve gastrectomy is almost always the surgery type used in this population. Few, if any, randomized controlled trials exist in these populations.",
    "Few, if any, randomized controlled trials exist in these populations. In observational data from the Teen-LABS (Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery) cohort, MBS was associated with improved Kidney outcomes in adolescents (aged 13 to 19 years) with severe obesity, including those with chronic kidney disease (G1-G4) and T2D. 124 The procedure led to significant improvements in estimated glomerular filtration rate, resolution of albuminuria in some, and reduction of hyperfiltration. For adolescents with chronic kidney disease f o G5/G5D or a Kidney transplant, data on outcomes of MBS are lacking. o Comparing Drug Therapies and MBS r p Figure 4 outlines the overall relative strengths and drawbacks of pharmacotherapy and MBS. - e Whether drug therapies or MBS are superior in achieving weight loss and safety endpoints has r P not been adequately studied; the current best-in-class FDA-approved agents (semaglutide and l tirzepatide) have not been prospectiavely compared with MBS at their maximum tolerated doses n for obesity management. Evidence from the SURMOUNT-1 (Tirzepatide Once Weekly for the r u Treatment of Obesity) study has indicated that the maximum dose of tirzepatide (15 magnesium) leads to o comparable weight loss as MBS. 11, 125 J Few observational data exist directly comparing surgical and medical interventions. The M6 (Macrovascular and Microvascular Morbidity and Mortality after Metabolic surgery versus Medicines) was a retrospective observational study in the United States from 20102017 comparing nephroprotective effect of MBS with GLP-1 RA. 126 In that study, patients who underwent MBS had a significantly lower incidence of chronic kidney disease progression (defined as the onset of ≥ 50% sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate compared with baseline, development of sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate 15 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2, initiation of Dialysis, or Kidney transplant after the index date) after a median follow-up of 5. 8 years. It is important to note, however, that none of the non-surgical 24 patients was receiving best-in-class medications such as semaglutide and tirzepatide at baseline, and only 19% received these agents during follow-up, limiting the true comparison between medical and surgical management. Uncontrolled studies comparing surgical and medical interventions using empaglifozin and liraglutide have shown comparable outcomes. The clinical study Metabolic Surgery Compared to the Best Clinical Treatment in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (MOMS) f o was a prospective, open-label, randomized study involving 100 patients with T2D, obesity, and o chronic kidney disease G1G3a, A2A3 (n100) comparing RYGB versus berst pharmacotherapy for patients with p T2D and obesity (empagliflozin, liraglutide). 125 Albuminuria remission was not statistically - e different between pharmacotherapy and RYGB after 5 years in participants with diabetic Kidney r P disease and class 1 obesity (body mass index 3035 kg/m2). RYGB was superior in improving glycemia, l diastolic Blood Hypertension, lipids, boday weight, and quality of life. However, more studies are n needed that include the most effective GLP-1 RA prospectively escalated to the maximum r u tolerated dose to adequately compare medical and surgical therapies. o J OPTIMAL MODELS OF CARE Patient participants at the conference emphasized the importance of having multidisciplinary care for support in choosing therapy and adopting changes in nutrition and physical activity level. Indeed, effective interventions for obesity and chronic kidney disease management require repeated interactions with healthcare teams, support for behavior change, flexibility, long-term monitoring, and follow-up, and they should be underpinned by behavior change models or theoretical frameworks. 91, 127 Individualized interventions must be supported by policy and advocacy at the community, national, and international levels to create long-term change.",
    "There 25 is substantial ongoing controversy around models of care; approaches based on implementation science are needed to support the rapid translation of treatments into care for populations globally. Optimal care models for people living with obesity and chronic kidney disease should aim to integrate the best Kidney care with the best obesity care by adopting a stigma-free, person-centered approach linking primary and secondary care, and involving a multidisciplinary team (MDT) trained to f o deliver long-term obesity and Kidney care. Where possible, the MDT should include o nephrologists, endocrinologists, obesity medicine physiciansr, cardiologists, Kidney dietitians, p bariatric dietitians, nurses, pharmacists, psychologists, and exercise professionals. Metabolic, - e Kidney, and patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) including diet quality, quality of life, physical r P function, and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) can provide valuable insights into l physical and mental health and treaatment satisfaction. 128, 129 People living with obesity and chronic kidney disease n should have access to holistic structured assessment, incorporating components of physical, r mental, and socio-econom u ic determinants of health. 128-130 Obesity is a key component in the o CKM syndrome (it is recognized that the Liver is connected to cardiovascular health and also J affects metabolic functioning). 131, 132 Providing education on the CKM syndrome may enhance understanding and engagement in dual obesity and chronic kidney disease management and support individualized goal setting. Figure 5 depicts a multidimensional approach to obesity and chronic kidney disease including acknowledgment of broader contexts and optimal integration of an MDT. Evidence has shown that person-centered care delivered by an appropriately trained MDT can improve CKM risk factors, PROMs, and PREMs, leading to reductions in risk of future CKM conditions and premature death. 76, 133, 134 Technology integration such as clinical decision support systems, 26 wearable devices, and mobile applications can enhance communications and timely referrals between primary and specialist care teams, empower self-management, and facilitate shared decision-making. 76, 133, 135 However, there are ongoing concerns with digital care including data privacy and confidentiality, health literacy, accessibility, user-friendliness, and costeffectiveness. 76, 135 Precision medicine approaches incorporating genomic and phenotyping information to guide management are being advocated, although examples of effective care f o models remain to be demonstrated. 136-138 o To reduce health inequality in access to evidence-basred interventions, especially in p resource-limited settings, standardization of evaluation and management procedures is needed. - e Figures 6 and 7 propose an inclusive management framework for people with obesity and r P chronic kidney disease. 139 The framework outlines a comprehensive evaluation followed by an individualized l management plan including person-acentered goal setting and the optimal integration of dietary n modification, physical activity, pharmacotherapy, and surgical interventions. Its implementation r u will depend on the presence of CKM risk factors, available resources, and shared treatment o goals. In all settings, dietary modification and physical activity interventions remain as J foundation therapy for chronic kidney disease and are complementary to medical and surgical interventions for obesity. 91, 140 Adopting a weight-neutral approach that focuses on health outcomes and health behaviors may be useful to support people who do not wish to focus on weight per se. A structured care model that integrates evidence-based technologies and principles of precision medicine will enable person-centered decision-making and thus may offer a sustainable strategy for managing the complexity of obesity and chronic kidney disease. To this end, public health policies that create a health-enabling ecosystem with capacity to facilitate the implementation of this integrated obesity and chronic kidney disease management framework with health economic evaluation are eagerly awaited.",
    "27 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Obesity and chronic kidney disease are increasingly prevalent conditions that often coexist, presenting significant challenges for prevention and management. As highlighted throughout this conference, there is a growing awareness that chronic kidney disease may be present in individuals living with obesity, yet many questions remain regarding early detection, optimal screening strategies, and the most effective f o ways to assess obesity-related Kidney risk. Addressing these uncertainties is critical to improving o long-term outcomes, particularly given the rising rates of obresity among children and young p adults. - e There is broad consensus that dietary changes, increased physical activity, and behavioral r P modifications form the foundation of obesity management in chronic kidney disease. However, the most effective l strategies for sustaining meaningfula, long-term changes remain elusive. Pharmacotherapies such n as GLP-1 RA offer substantial benefits, yet questions persist regarding their long-term safety, r u particularly for younger individuals and those with advanced chronic kidney disease. Kidney transplant patients o require careful consideration to avoid dehydration and to ensure the tolerability of these therapies J alongside immunosuppressive regimens. While randomized controlled trials in this area are unlikely, expert opinion and retrospective data may provide valuable guidance moving forward. A multidisciplinary approachincorporating nephrology, endocrinology, hepatology, and dieteticswill be essential in refining treatment strategies and expanding the evidence base. Notably, limited data exist on how successful interventions for weight loss impact Kidney function, particularly in advanced chronic kidney disease. Future research should explore whether targeted interventions can not only slow progression but potentially reverse Kidney dysfunction, addressing whether it is ever too late to intervene. 28 The urgency of preventing obesity early in life cannot be overstated. The long-term metabolic and Kidney consequences of early-onset obesity are profound, emphasizing the need for preventive strategies and early interventions. At the same time, significant gaps remain in our understanding of global epidemiology, treatment efficacy, and healthcare implementation, particularly in underrepresented regions. While many uncertainties remain, with continued collaboration, research, and innovation, f o strategies for managing obesity and chronic kidney disease will continue to evolve and improve, with the aim of o improving patient outcomes across the lifespan. r p - e r P l a n r u o J 29 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The conference was sponsored by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes and was in part supported by unrestricted educational grants from Alexion, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bayer HealthCare, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novo Nordisk, and Roche.

Metabolic domino as a conceptual model for the flow of events and chain reactions associated with obesity and chronic Kidney disease. The order of risk factors and outcomes is schematic and will differ between individuals based on genetic predispositions and lived environments. Changes in diet and physical activity level can lead to obesity and insulin f o resistance, followed by hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Worsening Kidney o function as evidenced by albuminuria and reduced glomerularr estimated glomerular filtration rate can lead to chronic p disease and its sequelae. Progression of the atherosclerotic process can lead to cardiovascular - e events such as ischemic Heart diseases or cerebrovascular disorders. Preclinical and clinical data r P indicate that treatments that inhibit the renin angiotensin system, such as angiotensin receptor l blockers, can suppress the onset of atype 2 Diabetes and, when administered even earlier in the n metabolic domino, reduce the development of hypertension in at-risk individuals. chronic kidney disease, chronic r u Kidney disease; cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease; MAFLD, metabolic dysfunctionassociated fatty o Liver disease.
