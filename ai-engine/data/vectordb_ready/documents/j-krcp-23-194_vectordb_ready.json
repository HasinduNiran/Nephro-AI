The high chronic kidney disease burden in this region is predominantly driven by an increased prevalence of risk factors including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and use of traditional medicines and is further aggravated by challenges associated with effective implementation of population-based screening and surveillance systems in early detection and intervention of chronic kidney disease. The Asian continent mostly comprised of lowand middle-income countries with resource restraints lacks robust population-based chronic kidney disease registries resulting in a paucity of data on chronic kidney disease incidence and prevalence, various treatment modalities, uptake of current guidelines, and the overall impact of implementation of developmental programs. There is an urgent need for a collaborative action plan between the healthcare community and governments in this region to detect chronic kidney disease in its early stages and prevent its complications including kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and death. Research-based evidence on the impact of early detection, sustainable treatment options, quality of life, delay or avoidance of dialysis, and related cost analysis is the need of the hour. We highlight successful implementation of strategic and policy-sharing programs adopted in a few countries; also, consolidate available region-specific data, quantify estimates of chronic kidney disease burden and propose strategies with a multidisciplinary approach involving patients, the healthcare community and governmental bodies to combat chronic kidney disease and its complications.

Developmental programs and initiatives for chronic kidney disease screening Country Developmental programs Taiwan The national kidney care program has resulted in improved clinical outcomes along with a reduction in health care system costs. The Department of Health made chronic kidney disease prevention and care a major public health priority and an integrated chronic kidney disease care program was initiated to promote the screening of high-risk populations, patient education, and multidisciplinary team care. Nephrotoxic Chinese herbs containing aristolochic acid were prohibited through public health legislation in 2003. National pay-for-performance programs for chronic kidney disease were implemented as part of health care improvement projects, along with diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease care in 2006 (pre-end-stage kidney disease program) and 2011 (early chronic kidney disease program) 119. The Taiwan model has been proposed for adoption by the Indonesian Ministry of Health as well.",
    "The Taiwan model has been proposed for adoption by the Indonesian Ministry of Health as well. Republic of Korea The Korean National Health Screening Program for chronic kidney disease was implemented in 2002 with biannual screening starting at the age of 40 years for chronic kidney disease by proteinuria (dipstick) and estimated glomerular filtration rate testing. Korean organ transplantation policies have ensured an increase in the availability of donor transplants, the Korean Society for Transplantation established a webbased registry, the Korean Organ Transplantation Registry to educate patients, donor families, and healthcare professionals. Philippines The Philippines national insurance covers kidney transplantation as a single largest payment for any surgical procedure. Thailand The Chronic Kidney Disease Prevention in the Northeast Thailand (CKDNET) is an initiative to reduce the chronic kidney disease burden in the region. Pamphlets, posters, brochures, and other media are distributed for chronic kidney disease education and awareness at the community level. Locally suitable practice guidelines have been formulated 120. Hong Kong The Screening for Hong Kong Asymptomatic Renal Population and Evaluation (SHARE) program is an effective screening program at the primary care level that identified potential subjects for further evaluation and aided in educating the public about the significance of following up even asymptomatic renal diseases 121. Singapore The HALT-chronic kidney disease program was started in 2017, the Holistic Approach in Lowering and Tracking Chronic Kidney Disease (HALT-chronic kidney disease) program concentrates on a concerted effort for timely detection and delaying the progression of chronic kidney disease in primary care settings through an integrated and multi-faceted approach. The program focuses on a series of lifestyle modifications (low-salt diet, physical activity, smoking cessation) and medical interventions such as optimization of RAASi, MRA, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor government has also authorized subsidies and reimbursements to reduce the financial burden in chronic kidney disease patients 122. Malaysia Under the Strategic Action Plan for Healthy Kidneys (ACT-KID) 2018-2025 there are various initiatives utilizing multisectoral collaborations to promote public and healthcare practitioner awareness of chronic kidney disease which emphasize the need for screening and early detection, as well as guideline-directed chronic kidney disease management 123. Indonesia The government NHIS launched a noncommunicable and chronic disease management program named Indonesian Chronic Disease Management Program (PROLANIS) in 2014 with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension as the main focus. It is specifically designed to be implemented at the primary care level (government-owned community healthcare centers, primary care clinics, or private doctors). As an integrated health service program, it controls the clinical and laboratory outcomes, prevents disease complications and improves patients quality of life 124.

Indications requiring referral to kidney specialists. Referral indications based on chronic kidney disease staging and specific conditions warranting comprehensive evaluation and management are elaborated. These indications emphasize the importance of specialized assessment and intervention by kidney specialists to optimize patient care and outcomes in chronic kidney disease management. Albuminuria and proteinuria can be measured using excretion rates in timed urine collections, the ratio of concentrations to creatinine concentration in spot urine samples, and using reagent strips in spot urine samples. Relationships among measurement methods within a category are not exact. For example, the relationships between AER and albumin-creatinine ratio and between PER and protein-creatinine ratio are based on the assumption that average creatinine excretion rate is approximately 1. 0 g/day or 10 mmol/day. The conversions are rounded for pragmatic reasons (for an exact conversion from magnesium/g of creatinine to magnesium/mmol of creatinine, multiply by 0. 113). Creatinine excretion varies with age, sex, race, and diet; therefore, the relationship among these categories is approximate only. albumin-creatinine ratio 10 magnesium/g (1 magnesium/mmol) is considered normal; albumin-creatinine ratio 1030 magnesium/g (13 magnesium/mmol) is considered high normal. albumin-creatinine ratio 2, 200 magnesium/g (220 magnesium/mmol) is considered nephrotic range.
