This includes all people with markers of Kidney damage and those with a glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate) of less than 60mL/min/1. 73m2 on at least 2 occasions separated by a period of at least 90 days (with or without markers of Kidney damage) Offer testing for chronic kidney disease using estimated Glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate), serum Creatinine and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio) to people with any of the following risk factors (see chronic kidney disease classification table above for estimated glomerular filtration rate testing frequency if chronic kidney disease diagnosis confirmed). Confirm an estimated glomerular filtration rate result of less than 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 in an adult not previously tested by repeating the test within 2 weeks. Allow for biological and analytical variability of serum Creatinine (±5%) when interpreting changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate. If diagnosis confirmed, identify the rate of progression with a minimum of 3 glomerular filtration rate estimations over a period of not less than 90 days.
