Practice Point 1. 1. 1. 2: Following incidental detection of elevated urinary albumin-to-Creatinine ratio (albumin-creatinine ratio), hematuria, or Low estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate), repeat tests to confirm presence of chronic kidney disease. 1. 1. 2 Methods for staging of chronic kidney disease Recommendation 1. 1. 2. 1: In adults at risk for chronic kidney disease, we recommend using Creatinine-based estimated glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFRcr).

    "1. 1. 3 Evaluation of chronicity Practice Point 1. 1. 3. 1: Proof of chronicity (duration of a minimum of 3 months) can be established by: (i) review of past measurements/estimations of glomerular filtration rate; (ii) review of past measurements of albuminuria or proteinuria and Urine microscopic examinations; (iii)imaging findings such as reduced Kidney size and reduction in cortical thickness; (iv) Kidney pathological findings such as fibrosis and atrophy; (v) medical history, especially conditions known to cause or contribute to chronic kidney disease; (vi) repeat measurements within and beyond the 3-month point. Practice Point 1. 1. 3. 2: Do not assume chronicity based upon a single abnormal level for estimated glomerular filtration rate and albumin-creatinine ratio, as the finding could be the result of a recent acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) event or acute Kidney disease (AKD).

Key recommendations and practice points are highlighted: Recommendation 3. 6. 1: We recommend starting renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (RASi) (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker angiotensin receptor blocker) for people with chronic kidney disease and severely increased albuminuria (G1G4, A3) without Diabetes (1B). Recommendation3. 6. 2: WesuggeststartingRASi(ACEiorARB)forpeoplewithCKDandmoderatelyincreased albuminuria (G1G4, A2) without Diabetes (2C). Recommendation 3. 6. 3: We recommend starting RASi (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker) for people with chronic kidney disease and moderately-toseverely increased albuminuria (G1G4, A2 and A3) with Diabetes (1B). Recommendation 3. 6. 4: We recommend avoiding any combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, and direct renin inhibitor (DRI) therapy in people with chronic kidney disease, with or without Diabetes (1B). S158 KidneyInternational(2024)105(Suppl4S), S117S314 www. Kidney-international. org summary of recommendation statements and practice points Practice Point 3. 6. 1: RASi (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker) should be administered using the highest approved dose that is tolerated to achieve thebenefitsdescribedbecausetheproven benefitswere achievedintrials using thesedoses. Practice Point 3. 6. 2: Changes in blood pressure, serum Creatinine, and serum Potassium should be checked within 24 weeks of initiation or increase in the dose of a RASi, depending on the current glomerular filtration rate and serum Potassium. Practice Point 3. 6. 3: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum Potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi. Practice Point 3. 6. 4: Continue angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy unless serum Creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose. Practice Point 3. 6. 5: Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in the setting of either symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating Kidney failure (estimated glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate estimated glomerular filtration rate 15 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2). PracticePoint3. 6. 6: ConsiderstartingpeoplewithCKDwithnormaltomildlyincreasedalbuminuria(A1)onRASi(ACEior angiotensin receptor blocker) for specific indications (e. g. , to treat hypertension or Heart failure with Low ejection fraction).

Practice Point 3. 7. 3: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor initiation or use does not necessitate alteration of frequency of chronic kidney disease monitoring and the reversible decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate on initiation is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy. Recommendation 3. 7. 3: We suggest treating adults with estimated glomerular filtration rate 20 to 45 milliliters per minute per 1. 73 m2 with Urine albumin-creatinine ratio 200 magnesium/g (20 magnesium/mmol) with an Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (2B). 3. 8 Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) TheWorkGrouphighlightsakey recommendation andpracticepointsfromtheKDIGO2022ClinicalPracticeGuidelinefor Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease. 23 Recommendation 3. 8. 1: We suggest a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with proven Kidney orcardiovascularbenefitforadultswithT2D, aneGFR25ml/minper1. 73m2, normal serum Potassium concentration, and albuminuria (30 magnesium/g 3 magnesium/mmol) despite maximum tolerated dose of renal artery stenosis inhibitor (RASi) (2A).
