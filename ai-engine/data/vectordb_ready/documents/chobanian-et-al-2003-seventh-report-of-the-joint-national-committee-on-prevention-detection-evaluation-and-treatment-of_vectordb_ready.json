Roccella, and the National Hypertension Education Program Coordinating Committee AbstractThe National Hypertension Education Program presents the complete Seventh Report of the Joint NationalCommitteeonPrevention, Detection, Evaluation, andTreatmentofHighBloodPressure. Likeitspredecessors, the purpose is to provide an evidence-based approach to the prevention and management of hypertension.

Despitethevariousbenefitsofdiuretics, theyremain underutilized. 128 Achieving Blood Hypertension Control in Individual Patients The algorithm for the treatment of hypertensive patients is shown in Figure 16. Therapy begins with lifestyle modification, and if the blood pressure goal is not achieved, thiazide-type diuretics should be used as initial therapy for most patients, either alone or in combination with one of the other classes (ACEIs, ARBs, BBs, CCBs) that have also been shown to reduce one or more hypertensive complications in randomizedcontrolledoutcometrials. Selectionofoneoftheseother agents as initial therapy is recommended when a diuretic cannot be used or when a compelling indication is present thatrequirestheuseofaspecificdrug, aslistedinTable12. If the initial drug selected is not tolerated or is contraindicated, then a drug from one of the other classes proven to reduce cardiovascular events should be substituted. Since most hypertensive patients will require 2 or more antihypertensive medications to achieve their blood pressure goals, addition of a second drug from a different class should be initiatedwhenuseofasingleagentinadequatedosesfailsto achieve the goal. When blood pressure is more than 20 mmHg above systolicgoalor10mmHgabovediastolicgoal, consideration should be given to initiate therapy with 2 drugs, either as Figure16.
