    "CChhrroonniicc kkiiddnneeyy ddiisseeaassee oovveerrvviieeww NICE Pathways bring together everything NICE says on a topic in an interactive flowchart. NICE Pathways are interactive and designed to be used online. They are updated regularly as new NICE guidance is published. To view the latest version of this NICE Pathway see: NICE Pathway last updated: 24 November 2021 This document contains a single flowchart and uses numbering to link the boxes to the associated recommendations.

CChhrroonniicc kkiiddnneeyy ddiisseeaassee oovveerrvviieeww NICE Pathways eGFRcreatinine may be less reliable in certain situations (for example, acute Kidney injury, pregnancy, oedematous states, muscle wasting disorders, and in adults who are malnourished, who have higher muscle mass or use Protein supplements, or who have had an amputation) and has not been well validated in certain ethnic groups (for example, black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups with chronic kidney disease living in the UK). Clinical laboratories should: use the chronic kidney disease-EPI Creatinine equation to estimate GFRcreatinine for adults, using Creatinine assays with calibration traceable to standardised reference material use Creatinine assays that are specific (for example, enzymatic assays) and zero-biased compared with IDMS participate in a UK national external quality assessment scheme for Creatinine. See the NICE guideline to find out why we did not make new recommendations on Creatininebased estimation of glomerular filtration rate. Reporting glomerular filtration rate values 2 Clinical laboratories should report estimated glomerular filtration rate either as a whole number if it is 90 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m or 2 less, or as greater than 90 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m .
