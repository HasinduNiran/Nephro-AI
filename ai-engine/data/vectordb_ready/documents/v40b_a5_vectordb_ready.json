Juncos, MD, Department of Medicine/Nephrology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) affects African Americans in a disproportionately High manner and progresses more rapidly than in other races. Lack of knowledge of chronic kidney disease risk factors and progression may contribute to this disparity. The purpose of this non-random cross-sectional study was to determine the level of chronic kidney disease knowledge among students attending a historically black college and university (HBCU). Men and women enrolled in healthcare administration, health education, social work, and public health courses were asked to participate in the study. The Chronic Kidney Disease Knowledge in College Students Questionnaire was utilized. A total of 270 participants from a single HBCU were included. The results demonstrate that chronic kidney disease knowledge was Low in this population, particularly among the younger college students. This study provides a foundation for chronic kidney disease community education, and will be helpful to nephrology social workers in chronic kidney disease settings and Kidney organizations for specifically targeting and educating at-risk individuals. INTRODUCTION Diabetes in the United States, affecting approximately 12. 9% of the adult population (Mississippi State Department of Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) affects more than 26 million Health (MSDH), 2015a). people in the United States at varying levels of severity, with most being undiagnosed (Centers for Disease Control and Similarly, hypertension is more common in African Prevention (CDC), 2015). According to the CDC, chronic kidney disease is Americans. This population is more likely to develop hyperthe ninth leading cause of death in the U. S. (CDC, 2015). tension at an earlier age, and it is more likely to be severe and There has been a drastic increase in the number of chronic kidney disease inadequately controlled (MSDH, 2015b; Moulton, 2009). patients who eventually develop end-stage renal disease Mississippi has the second highest prevalence of hyper- (end-stage renal disease). end-stage renal disease is projected to increase in prevalence by 50% tension in the nation, affecting more than 700, 000 adults over the next decade (Collins, Gilbertson, Snyder, Chen, (MSDH, 2015b; Trust for Americas Health Robert Wood Foley, 2010). Hence, chronic kidney disease is a major public health problem Johnson Foundation, 2015). with widespread socio-economic impact. Among the genWhile the rates of end-stage renal disease due to hypertension have decreased eral Medicare population, the cost to treat chronic kidney disease represents for Caucasians younger than 40, it has actually increased 20. 1% of Medicare spending at 50. 4 billion. Additionally, among African Americans (NMA, n. d. ). However, despite the end-stage renal disease population adds 7% to (Medicare spending this rather alarming trend, this community lacks basic United States Renal Data System (USRDS, 2015). understanding of chronic kidney disease and the risk factors contributing A key issue with this disease is that it disproportionately to the disease process (Plantinga, Tuot, Powe, 2010). affects racial and ethnic minorities (Muntner, et al. , 2012). Interestingly, while many individuals are aware of Diabetes The end-stage renal disease incidence rate is three times higher in African and hypertension as health problems, they fail to correAmericans, compared to Caucasians (USRDS, 2015).",
    "Indeed, late Diabetes and hypertension to chronic kidney disease, or view chronic kidney disease as a although African Americans make up only 13% of the U. S. health problem (Chow, et al. , 2012; Plantinga, Tuot, Powe, population (U. S. Census Bureau, 2015), 35% of end-stage renal disease 2010). This suggests that there are substantial shortcomings patients on Dialysis are from this community (USRDS, in chronic kidney disease knowledge in the African American community. 2015). Moreover, Dialysis patients have higher mortality Thus, the primary aim of this study was to perform a pilot rates compared to the general population. However, African in which we assessed chronic kidney disease knowledge of college students American and Caucasian Dialysis patients younger than 45 enrolled in health courses at a historically black college and years-old have similar mortality rates (USRDS, 2015). university (HBCU).

The goal of this study was to help discover the Study Questionnaire population who would most likely benefit from chronic kidney disease education, and have a positive impact in health awareness within The survey included 7 questions designed to assess chronic kidney disease the African American community. Its intended audience is knowledge. Five of the 7 questions were obtained, with pernephrology social workers who work in chronic kidney disease settings.

Survey questions were based on the competent practices. physiology, etiology, presentation, progression, complication, identification, and anatomy of chronic kidney disease. Responses to the METHODS questions were scored 07, depending on the number of correct answers. All questions were weighed equally (0 points if Study Design not correct; 1 point if correct). The study followed a descriptive cross-sectional design with a quantitative approach to assess chronic kidney disease knowledge of students Statistical Analysis at a HBCU. Descriptive research was the most direct option Participants were divided by the following characteristics for assessing the knowledge of students to further assist with for purposes of analysis: gender, race (African American vs. the development of interventions for the target population. Non-African American), age, and academic classification. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze each item of the Study Participants and Data Collection survey to include demographic information.",
