    "WeldegiorgisandWoodwardBMCNephrology (2020) 21: 506 RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access The impact of hypertension on chronic Kidney disease and end-stage renal disease is greater in men than women: a systematic review and meta-analysis Misghina Weldegiorgis1, 2 and Mark Woodward1, 2, 3 Abstract Background: Hypertension (hypertension) is anestablishedrisk factorfor chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) and end-stage renal disease (end-stage renal disease). Whethersex differences inthe effect ofHTN onCKD and end-stage renal disease incidence exist remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate therelative impact of hypertension on CKDand end-stage renal disease risk inwomen compared with men. Methods: We systematically searched Embase and PubMed for cohort studies until 24 July 2020. Studies were selected iftheyreported a sex-specific association between systolic Blood Hypertension (SBP) and CKDor end-stage renal disease. Random effects meta-analyses with inverse varianceweighting were used to poolsex-specific relative risks (RRs) and the women-to-men ratio of RRs (the RRR)for incident chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. Results: Data from sixcohorts, including 2, 382, 712 individuals and 6856 incident chronic kidney disease events, and 833 end-stage renal disease events, were included inthe meta-analysis. The RRfor incidentCKD or end-stage renal disease associated with hypertension (SBP≥140mmHg)versus idealBP (SBP 120mmHg) was 1. 56 (95% CI, 1. 391. 75) inwomenand 2. 06 (95%CI, 1. 642. 60) in men. The respiratory rate for incident CKDor ESRDwas 23% lower in women than inmenRRR 0. 77 95% CI, 0. 630. 95 with nosignificant heterogeneity between studies (p-value for Qtest0. 507, I2 17. 7%). Conclusion: hypertension confers about a fifth lower excess risk ofincidentCKD or end-stage renal disease in women than men. Sex differences inonset, duration, and severity of some risk factors, such as albuminuria, Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and socioeconomic status, may explain part of the excess risk in men. Another explanation could be that women might be under-diagnosed and less likelyto initiate Dialysis. Future studies are needed to demonstrate the mechanisms responsible for theobserved sex difference.
