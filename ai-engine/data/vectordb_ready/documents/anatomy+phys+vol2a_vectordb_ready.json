Basic Functions The nervous system is involved in receiving information about the environment around ultrasound (sensation) and generating responses to that information (motor responses). The nervous system can be divided into regions that are responsible for sensation (sensory functions) and for the response (motor functions). But there is a third function that needs to be included. Sensoryinputneedstobeintegratedwithothersensations, aswellaswithmemories, emotionalstate, orlearning (cognition). Some regions of the nervous system are termed integration or association areas.

Human unipolar cells have an axon that emerges from the cell body, but it splits so that the axon can extend along a very long distance.

Multipolar neurons are all of the neurons that are not unipolar or bipolar. They have one axon and two or more dendrites(usuallymanymore). Withtheexceptionoftheunipolarsensoryganglioncells, andthetwospecificbipolarcells mentioned above, all other neurons are multipolar.

Any of thoseprocessescanfunctionasanaxondependingontheconditionsatanygiventime. Nevertheless, eveniftheycannot be easily seen, and one specific process is definitively the axon, these neurons have multiple processes and are therefore multipolar. Neurons can also be classified on the basis of where they are found, who found them, what they do, or even what chemicals they use to communicate with each other. Some neurons referred to in this section on the nervous system are named on the basis of those sorts of classifications (Figure 12. 10). For example, a multipolar neuron that has a very importantroletoplayinapartofthebraincalledthecerebellumisknownasaPurkinje(commonlypronouncedper-KINgee) cell. It is named after the anatomist who discovered it (Jan Evangilista Purkinje, 17871869). Figure 12. 10 Other Neuron Classifications Three examples of neurons that are classified on the basis of other criteria. (a) The pyramidal cell is a multipolar cell with a cell body that is shaped something like a pyramid. (b) The Purkinje cell in the cerebellum was named after the scientist who originally described it. (c) Olfactory neurons are named for the functional group with which they belong.

    "To understand how neurons are able to communicate, it is necessary to describe the role of an excitable membrane in generating these signals. The basis of this communication is the action potential, which demonstrateshowchangesinthemembranecanconstituteasignal. Lookingatthewaythesesignalsworkinmorevariable circumstances involves a look at graded potentials, which will be covered in the next section. Electrically Active Cell Membranes Most cells in the body make use of charged particles, ions, to build up a charge across the cell membrane. Previously, this was shown to be a part of how muscle cells work. For skeletal muscles to contract, based on excitationcontraction coupling, requiresinputfromaneuron. Bothofthecellsmakeuseofthecellmembranetoregulateionmovementbetween the extracellular fluid and cytosol. As you learned in the chapter on cells, the cell membrane is primarily responsible for regulating what can cross the membraneandwhatstaysononlyoneside. Thecellmembraneisaphospholipidbilayer, soonlysubstancesthatcanpass directlythroughthehydrophobiccorecandiffusethroughunaided. Chargedparticles, whicharehydrophilicbydefinition, cannot pass through the cell membrane without assistance (Figure 12. 17). Transmembrane proteins, specifically channel proteins, make this possible. Several channels, as well as specialized energy dependent ion-pumps, are necessary to generateatransmembranepotentialandtogenerateanactionpotential. Ofspecialinterestisthecarrierproteinreferredtoas thesodium/potassiumpumpthatmovessodiumions(sodium )outofacellandpotassiumions(potassium )intoacell, thusregulating ion concentration on both sides of the cell membrane. 488 CHAPTER 12 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE Figure 12. 17 Cell Membrane and Transmembrane Proteins The cell membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayerandhasmanytransmembraneproteins, includingdifferenttypesofchannelproteinsthatserveasionchannels. Thesodium/potassiumpumprequiresenergyintheformofadenosinetriphosphate(ATP), soitisalsoreferredtoas an ATPase. As was explained in the cell chapter, the concentration of sodium is higher outside the cell than inside, and the concentrationofK ishigherinsidethecellishigherthanoutside. Thatmeansthatthispumpismovingtheionsagainstthe concentrationgradientsforsodiumandpotassium, whichiswhyitrequiresenergy. Infact, thepumpbasicallymaintains those concentration gradients. Ion channels are pores that allow specific charged particles to cross the membrane in response to an existing concentration gradient. Proteins are capable of spanning the cell membrane, including its hydrophobic core, and can interactwiththechargeofionsbecauseofthevariedpropertiesofaminoacidsfoundwithinspecificdomainsorregions of the Protein channel. Hydrophobic amino acids are found in the domains that are apposed to the hydrocarbon tails of the phospholipids. Hydrophilic amino acids are exposed to the fluid environments of the extracellular fluid and cytosol. Additionally, the ions will interact with the hydrophilic amino acids, which will be selective for the charge of the ion. Channelsforcations(positiveions)willhavenegativelychargedsidechainsinthepore. Channelsforanions(negativeions) will have positively charged side chains in the pore. This is called electrochemical exclusion, meaning that the channel pore is charge-specific. Ions can also be specified by the diameter of the pore. The distance between the amino acids will be specific for the diameter of the ion when it dissociates from the Water molecules surrounding it. Because of the surrounding Water molecules, largerporesarenotidealforsmallerionsbecausethewatermoleculeswillinteract, byhydrogenbonds, more readilythantheaminoacidsidechains. Thisiscalledsizeexclusion. Someionchannelsareselectiveforchargebutnot necessarilyforsize, andthusarecalledanonspecificchannel. ThesenonspecificchannelsallowcationsparticularlyNa, 2 potassium, and calcium to cross the membrane, but exclude anions. Ion channels do not always freely allow ions to diffuse across the membrane. They are opened by certain events, meaning the channels are gated. So another way that channels can be categorized is on the basis of how they are gated. Althoughtheseclassesofionchannelsarefoundprimarilyincellsofnervousormusculartissue, theyalsocanbefoundin cells of epithelial and connective tissues.

Avoltage-gatedchannelisachannelthatrespondstochangesintheelectricalpropertiesofthemembraneinwhich it is embedded. Normally, the inner portion of the membrane is at a negative voltage. When that voltage becomes less negative, the channel begins to allow ions to cross the membrane (Figure 12. 20). 490 CHAPTER 12 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE Figure 12. 20 Voltage-Gated Channels Voltage-gated channels open when the transmembrane voltage changes around them. Amino acids in the structure of the Protein are sensitive to charge and cause the pore to open to the selected ion. A leakage channel is randomly gated, meaning that it opens and closes at random, hence the reference to leaking. Thereisnoactualeventthatopensthechannel; instead, ithasanintrinsicrateofswitchingbetweentheopenandclosed states. Leakage channels contribute to the resting transmembrane voltage of the excitable membrane (Figure 12. 21).

By comparing the charge measured by these two electrodes, the transmembrane voltage is determined. It is conventional to express that value for the cytosol relative to the outside. The concentration of ions in extracellular and intracellular fluids is largely balanced, with a net neutral charge. However, a slight difference in charge occurs right at the membrane surface, both internally and externally. It is the difference in this very limited region that has all the power in neurons (and muscle cells) to generate electrical signals, including action potentials. Beforetheseelectricalsignalscanbedescribed, therestingstateofthemembranemustbeexplained.

As the membrane potential reaches 30 mV, other voltage-gated channels are opening in the membrane. These channels are specific for the Potassium ion. A concentration gradient acts on potassium, as well. As potassium starts to leave the cell, taking a positive charge with it, the membrane potential begins to move back toward its resting voltage. This is calledrepolarization, meaningthatthemembranevoltagemovesbacktowardthe-70mVvalueoftherestingmembrane potential.

Figure 12. 23 Graph of Action Potential Plotting voltage measured across the cell membrane against time, the action potential begins with depolarization, followed by repolarization, which goes past the resting potential into hyperpolarization, and finally the membrane returns to rest.

Thereareafewdifferenttypes of channels that allow sodium to cross the membrane.

Once the membrane reaches that voltage, the voltage-gated sodium channels open. This is what is known as the threshold. Any depolarization that does not change the membrane potential to -55 mV or higher will not reach threshold andthuswillnotresultinanactionpotential. Also, anystimulusthatdepolarizesthemembraneto-55mVorbeyondwill cause a large number of channels to open and an action potential will be initiated. Because of the threshold, the action potential can be likened to a digital eventit either happens or it does not. If the threshold is not reached, then no action potential occurs. If depolarization reaches -55 mV, then the action potential continues and runs all the way to 30 mV, at which potassium causes repolarization, including the hyperpolarizing overshoot. Also, thosechangesarethesameforeveryactionpotential, whichmeansthatoncethethresholdisreached, theexactsame thing happens.

Thereisahighdensityof voltage-gatedNa channelssothatrapiddepolarizationcantakeplacehere. Goingdownthelengthoftheaxon, theaction potentialispropagatedbecausemorevoltage-gatedNa channelsareopenedasthedepolarizationspreads. Thisspreading occurs because sodium enters through the channel and moves along the inside of the cell membrane. As the sodium moves, or flows, ashortdistancealongthecellmembrane, itspositivechargedepolarizesalittlemoreofthecellmembrane. Asthat depolarizationspreads, newvoltage-gatedNa channelsopenandmoreionsrushintothecell, spreadingthedepolarization a little farther. Because voltage-gated sodium channels are inactivated at the peak of the depolarization, they cannot be opened again forabrieftimetheabsoluterefractoryperiod. Becauseofthis, depolarizationspreadingbacktowardpreviouslyopened channelshasnoeffect. Theactionpotentialmustpropagatetowardtheaxonterminals; asaresult, thepolarityoftheneuron is maintained, as mentioned above. Propagation, as described above, applies to unmyelinated axons. When myelination is present, the action potential propagates differently. Sodium ions that enter the cell at the initial segment start to spread along the length of the axon segment, buttherearenovoltage-gatedNa channelsuntilthefirstnodeofRanvier. Becausethereisnotconstantopening ofthesechannelsalongtheaxonsegment, thedepolarizationspreadsatanoptimalspeed. Thedistancebetweennodesis the optimal distance to keep the membrane still depolarized above threshold at the next node.

Ifthenodewereanyfartherdowntheaxon, that depolarizationwouldhavefallenofftoomuchforvoltage-gatedNa channelstobeactivatedatthenextnodeofRanvier. If the nodes were any closer together, the speed of propagation would be slower. Propagation along an unmyelinated axon is referred to as continuous conduction; along the length of a myelinated axon, it is saltatory conduction. Continuous conduction is slow because there are always voltage-gated sodium channels opening, andmoreandmoreNa isrushingintothecell.

If the balance of ions is upset, drastic outcomes are possible. Normally the concentration of potassium is higher inside the neuron than outside.

Astimulusstartsthedepolarization, buttheactionpotentialrunsonitsownonceathresholdhasbeenreached. The question is now, What flips the light switch on? Temporary changes to the cell membrane voltage can result from neuronsreceivinginformationfromtheenvironment, orfromtheactionofoneneurononanother. Thesespecialtypesof potentialsinfluenceaneuronanddeterminewhetheranactionpotentialwilloccurornot. Manyofthesetransientsignals originate at the synapse. Graded Potentials Local changes in the membrane potential are called graded potentials and are usually associated with the dendrites of a neuron. The amount of change in the membrane potential is determined by the size of the stimulus that causes it. In the example of testing the temperature of the shower, slightly warm Water would only initiate a small change in a thermoreceptor, whereas hot Water would cause a large amount of change in the membrane potential. Gradedpotentialscanbeoftwosorts, eithertheyaredepolarizingorhyperpolarizing(Figure12. 25). Foramembrane at the resting potential, a graded potential represents a change in that voltage either above -70 mV or below -70 mV. 2 Depolarizing graded potentials are often the result of sodium or calcium entering the cell. Both of these ions have higher concentrationsoutsidethecellthaninside; becausetheyhaveapositivecharge, theywillmoveintothecellcausingitto - becomelessnegativerelativetotheoutside. HyperpolarizinggradedpotentialscanbecausedbyK leavingthecellorCl enteringthecell.

Some types of stimuli cause depolarization of the membrane, whereasotherscausehyperpolarization. Itdependsonthespecificionchannelsthatareactivatedinthe cell membrane. Types of Graded Potentials For the unipolar cells of sensory neuronsboth those with free nerve endings and those within encapsulationsgraded potentials develop in the dendrites that influence the generation of an action potential in the axon of the same cell. This iscalledageneratorpotential. Forothersensoryreceptorcells, suchastastecellsorphotoreceptorsoftheretina, graded potentialsintheirmembranesresultinthereleaseofneurotransmittersatsynapseswithsensoryneurons. Thisiscalleda receptor potential. A postsynaptic potential (PSP) is the graded potential in the dendrites of a neuron that is receiving synapses from other cells. Postsynaptic potentials can be depolarizing or hyperpolarizing. Depolarization in a postsynaptic potential is calledanexcitatorypostsynapticpotential(EPSP)becauseitcausesthemembranepotentialtomovetowardthreshold. Hyperpolarization in a postsynaptic potential is an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) because it causes the membrane potential to move away from threshold. Summation All types of graded potentials will result in small changes of either depolarization or hyperpolarization in the voltage of a membrane. These changes can lead to the neuron reaching threshold if the changes add together, or summate. The combinedeffectsofdifferenttypesofgradedpotentialsareillustratedinFigure12. 26.

In the nervous system, there are many more synapses that are essentially the same as the NMJ. All synapses have common characteristics, which can be summarized in this list: presynaptic element neurotransmitter (packaged in vesicles) synaptic cleft receptor proteins postsynaptic element neurotransmitter elimination or re-uptake For the NMJ, these characteristics are as follows: the presynaptic element is the motor neurons axon terminals, the neurotransmitterisacetylcholine, thesynapticcleftisthespacebetweenthecellswheretheneurotransmitterdiffuses, the receptorproteinisthenicotinicacetylcholinereceptor, thepostsynapticelementisthesarcolemmaofthemusclecell, and 498 CHAPTER 12 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE theneurotransmitteriseliminatedbyacetylcholinesterase.

This includes glutamate (Glu), GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid, a derivative of glutamate), and glycine (Gly). These amino acids have an amino group and a carboxyl group in their chemical structures. Glutamate is one of the 20 amino acids that are used to make proteins. Each amino acid neurotransmitter would be part of its own system, namely the glutamatergic, GABAergic, and glycinergic systems.

    "1Basic Structure and Function of the Nervous System Thenervoussystemcanbeseparatedintodivisionsonthebasisofanatomyandphysiology. Theanatomicaldivisionsare thecentralandperipheralnervoussystems. TheCNSisthebrainandspinalcord. ThePNSiseverythingelse. Functionally, the nervous system can be divided into those regions that are responsible for sensation, those that are responsible for integration, andthosethatareresponsibleforgeneratingresponses. Allofthesefunctionalareasarefoundinboththecentral and peripheral anatomy. Considering the anatomical regions of the nervous system, there are specific names for the structures within each division. AlocalizedcollectionofneuroncellbodiesisreferredtoasanucleusintheCNSandasaganglioninthePNS. A bundleofaxonsisreferredtoasatractintheCNSandasanerveinthePNS. Whereasnucleiandgangliaarespecifically inthecentralorperipheraldivisions, axonscancrosstheboundarybetweenthetwo. Asingleaxoncanbepartofanerve and a tract.

Thenervoussystemcanalsobedividedonthebasisofhowitcontrolsthebody. Thesomaticnervoussystem(SNS) is responsible for functions that result in moving skeletal muscles. Any sensory or integrative functions that result in the movement of skeletal muscle would be considered somatic. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is responsible for functionsthataffectcardiacorsmoothmuscletissue, orthatcauseglandstoproducetheirsecretions. Autonomicfunctions are distributed between central and peripheral regions of the nervous system. The sensations that lead to autonomic functions can be the same sensations that are part of initiating somatic responses. Somatic and autonomic integrative functions may overlap as well. A special division of the nervous system is the enteric nervous system, which is responsible for controlling the digestive organs. Parts of the autonomic nervous system overlap with the enteric nervous system. The enteric nervous system is exclusively found in the periphery because it is the nervous tissue in the organs of the digestive system. 12. 2Nervous Tissue Nervoustissuecontainstwomajorcelltypes, neuronsandglialcells. Neuronsarethecellsresponsibleforcommunication through electrical signals. Glial cells are supporting cells, maintaining the environment around the neurons. Neuronsarepolarizedcells, basedontheflowofelectricalsignalsalongtheirmembrane. Signalsarereceivedatthe dendrites, arepassedalongthecellbody, andpropagatealongtheaxontowardsthetarget, whichmaybeanotherneuron, muscle tissue, or a gland. Many axons are insulated by a lipid-rich substance called myelin. Specific types of glial cells provide this insulation. Several types of glial cells are found in the nervous system, and they can be categorized by the anatomical division in which they are found. In the CNS, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and ependymalcellsare found. Astrocytes are importantfor maintainingthe chemicalenvironmentaround the neuron and are crucialfor regulatingthe Blood-brain barrier. Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating glia in the CNS. Microglia act as phagocytes and play a role in immune surveillance.

Thoughtheentericnervoussystemreceivesinputoriginating from central neurons of the autonomic nervous system, it does not require CNS input to function. In fact, it operates independently to regulate the digestive system. Nerves Bundles of axons in the PNS are referred to as nerves. These structures in the periphery are different than the central counterpart, called a tract. Nerves are composed of more than just nervous tissue. They have connective tissues invested in their structure, as well as Blood vessels supplying the tissues with nourishment. The outer surface of a nerve is a surrounding layer of fibrous connective tissue called the epineurium. Within the nerve, axons are further bundled into fascicles, whichareeachsurroundedbytheirownlayeroffibrousconnectivetissuecalledperineurium.

Photoreceptorsinthe eyes, such as renal osteodystrophy cells, are examples of (c) specialized receptor cells.

The first two tastes (salty and sour) are triggered by the cations sodium and H. The other tastes result from food molecules binding to a G Proteincoupled receptor. A G Protein signal transduction system ultimately leads to depolarization of the gustatory cell. The sweet taste is the sensitivity of gustatory cells to the presence of glucose dissolvedinthesaliva.

However, thereareanumber of different ways in which this can happen because there are a large diversity of bitter-tasting molecules. Some bitter moleculesdepolarizegustatorycells, whereasothershyperpolarizegustatorycells. Likewise, somebittermoleculesincrease Gproteinactivationwithinthegustatorycells, whereasotherbittermoleculesdecreaseGproteinactivation. Thespecific response depends on which molecule is binding to the receptor. One major group of bitter-tasting molecules are alkaloids. Alkaloids are nitrogen-containing molecules that often haveabasicpH. Alkaloidsarecommonlyfoundinbitter-tastingplantproducts, suchascoffee, hops(inbeer), tannins(in wine), tea, andaspirin.",

Movement of the eye within the orbit is accomplished by the contraction of six extraocular muscles that originate from the bones of the orbit and insert into the surface of the eyeball (Figure 14. 14). Four of the muscles are arranged at thecardinalpointsaroundtheeyeandarenamedforthoselocations. Theyarethesuperiorrectus, medialrectus, inferior rectus, and lateral rectus. When each of these muscles contract, the eye to moves toward the contracting muscle. For example, when the superior rectus contracts, the eye rotates to look up.

    "The Hypothalamus The hypothalamus is the control center for many homeostatic mechanisms. It regulates both autonomic function and endocrinefunction.

It receives input from cerebral structures and projects to brain stem and spinal cord structures to regulate the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic input to the organ systems of the body. The main pathways for this are the medial forebrain bundle and the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus. These two tracts connect the hypothalamus with the major parasympathetic nuclei in the brain stem and the preganglionic (central) neurons of the thoracolumbar spinal cord. The hypothalamus also receives input from other areas of the forebrain through the medial forebrain bundle. The olfactory cortex, the septal nuclei of the basal forebrain, and the amygdala project into the hypothalamus through the medial forebrain bundle. These forebrain structures inform the hypothalamus about the state of the nervous system and can influence the regulatory processes of homeostasis.

The Medulla The medulla contains nuclei referred to as the cardiovascular center, which controls the smooth and cardiac muscle of the cardiovascular system through autonomic connections. When the homeostasis of the cardiovascular system shifts, such as when Blood Hypertension changes, the coordination of the autonomic system can be accomplished within this region. Furthermore, when descending inputs from the hypothalamus stimulate this area, the sympathetic system can increase activity in the cardiovascular system, such as in response to anxiety or stress. The preganglionic sympathetic fibers that are responsible for increasing Heart rate are referred to as the cardiac accelerator nerves, whereas the preganglionic sympathetic fibers responsible for constricting Blood vessels compose thevasomotor nerves. Several brain stem nuclei are important for the visceral control of major organ systems. One brain stem nucleus involved in cardiovascular function is the solitary nucleus.

Ganglia of both divisions are activated equally by the drug. For many target organs in the body, this results in no net change. The competing inputs to the system cancel each other out and nothing significant happens. For example, the sympathetic system will cause sphincters in the digestive tract to contract, limiting digestive propulsion, but the parasympatheticsystemwillcausethecontractionofothermusclesinthedigestivetract, whichwilltrytopushthecontents ofthedigestivesystemalong.

Norepinephrineandepinephrineinfluence target effectors by binding to the α-adrenergic or β-adrenergic receptors. Drugs that affect the sympathetic system affect thesechemicalsystems. Thedrugscanbeclassifiedbywhethertheyenhancethefunctionsofthesympatheticsystemor interruptthosefunctions. Adrugthatenhancesadrenergicfunctionisknownasasympathomimeticdrug, whereasadrug that interrupts adrenergic function is asympatholytic drug. Sympathomimetic Drugs Whenthesympatheticsystemisnotfunctioningcorrectlyorthebodyisinastateofhomeostaticimbalance, thesedrugs act at postganglionic terminals and synapses in the sympathetic efferent pathway. These drugs either bind to particular adrenergic receptors and mimic norepinephrine at the synapses between sympathetic postganglionic fibers and their targets, or they increase the production and release of norepinephrine from postganglionic fibers. Also, to increase the effectivenessofadrenergicchemicalsreleasedfromthefibers, someofthesedrugsmayblocktheremovalorreuptakeof the neurotransmitter from the synapse. Acommonsympathomimeticdrugisphenylephrine, whichisacommoncomponentofdecongestants. Itcanalsobe used to dilate the pupil and to raise Blood Hypertension. Phenylephrine is known as an α1-adrenergic agonist, meaning that it binds to a specific adrenergic receptor, stimulating a response. In this role, phenylephrine will bind to the adrenergic receptors in bronchioles of the lungs and cause them to dilate.",

It can also be used to increase Blood Hypertension in situations in which cardiac function is compromised, such as under anesthesia or during septic shock. Figure 15. 14 Mydriasis The sympathetic system causes pupillary dilation when norepinephrine binds to an adrenergic receptor in the radial fibers of the iris smooth muscle. Phenylephrine mimics this action by binding to the same receptor when drops are applied onto the surface of the eye in a doctors office. (credit: Corey Theiss) Otherdrugsthatenhanceadrenergicfunctionarenotassociatedwiththerapeuticuses, butaffectthefunctionsofthe sympatheticsysteminasimilarfashion. Cocaineprimarilyinterfereswiththeuptakeofdopamineatthesynapseandcan also increase adrenergic function. Caffeine is an antagonist to a different neurotransmitter receptor, called the adenosine receptor. Adenosine will suppress adrenergic activity, specifically the release of norepinephrine at synapses, so caffeine indirectlyincreasesadrenergicactivity. Thereissomeevidencethatcaffeinecanaidinthetherapeuticuseofdrugs, perhaps bypotentiating(increasing)sympatheticfunction, asissuggestedbytheinclusionofcaffeineinover-the-counteranalgesics such as Excedrin.

Theyblocktheabilityofnorepinephrineorepinephrinetobindtothe 636 CHAPTER 15 THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM receptorssothattheeffectiscutortakesablow, torefertotheendings-lyticand-plegic, respectively. Thevarious drugs of this class will be specific to α-adrenergic or β-adrenergic receptors, or to their receptor subtypes. Possibly the most familiar type of sympatholytic drug are the β-blockers. These drugs are often used to treat cardiovascular disease because they block the β-receptors associated with vasoconstriction and cardioacceleration. By allowing Blood vessels to dilate, or keeping Heart rate from increasing, these drugs can improve cardiac function in a compromised system, such as for a person with congestive Heart failure or who has previously suffered a Heart attack. A coupleofcommonversionsofβ-blockersaremetaprolol, whichspecificallyblockstheβ2-receptor, andpropanolol, which nonspecifically blocks β-receptors. There are other drugs that are α-blockers and can affect the sympathetic system in a similar way. Otherusesforsympatholyticdrugsareasantianxietymedications. Acommonexampleofthisisclonidine, whichisan α-blocker. Thesympatheticsystemistiedtoanxietytothepointthatthesympatheticresponsecanbereferredtoasfight, flight, orfright. Clonidineisusedforothertreatmentsasidefromhypertensionandanxiety, includingpainconditionsand attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Parasympathetic Effects Drugsaffectingparasympatheticfunctionscanbeclassifiedintothosethatincreaseordecreaseactivityatpostganglionic terminals. Parasympathetic postganglionic fibers release ACh, and the receptors on the targets are muscarinic receptors. There are several types of muscarinic receptors, M1M5, but the drugs are not usually specific to the specific types. Parasympatheticdrugscanbeeithermuscarinicagonistsorantagonists, orhaveindirecteffectsonthecholinergicsystem. Drugs that enhance cholinergic effects are called parasympathomimetic drugs, whereas those that inhibit cholinergic effects are referred to asanticholinergic drugs. Pilocarpineisanonspecificmuscarinicagonistcommonlyusedtotreatdisordersoftheeye. Itreversesmydriasis, such asiscausedbyphenylephrine, andcanbeadministeredafteraneyeexam.

Endocrinologistsmedical doctors who specialize in this fieldare experts in treating diseases associated with hormonal systems, ranging from thyroid disease to Diabetes mellitus. Endocrine surgeons treat endocrine disease through the removal, or resection, of the affected endocrine gland. Patients who are referred to endocrinologists may have signs and symptoms or Blood test results that suggest excessiveorimpairedfunctioningofanendocrineglandorendocrinecells. Theendocrinologistmayorderadditional Blood tests to determine whether the patients hormonal levels are abnormal, or they may stimulate or suppress the function of the suspect endocrine gland and then have Blood taken for analysis. Treatment varies according to the diagnosis. Someendocrinedisorders, suchastype2diabetes, mayrespondtolifestylechangessuchasmodestweight loss, adoptionofahealthydiet, andregularphysicalactivity. Otherdisordersmayrequiremedication, suchashormone replacement, and routine monitoring by the endocrinologist. These include disorders of the pituitary gland that can affect growth and disorders of the thyroid gland that can result in a variety of metabolic problems. Some patients experience health problems as a result of the normal decline in hormones that can accompany aging. These patients can consult with an endocrinologist to weigh the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy intended to boost their natural levels of reproductive hormones. In addition to treating patients, endocrinologists may be involved in research to improve the understanding of endocrine system disorders and develop new treatments for these diseases. 17. 2 Hormones By the end of this section, you will be able to: Identify the three major classes of hormones on the basis of chemical structure Compare and contrast intracellular and cell membrane hormone receptors Describe signaling pathways that involve cAMP and IP3 Identify several factors that influence a target cells response Discuss the role of feedback loops and humoral, hormonal, and neural stimuli in hormone control Although a given hormone may travel throughout the body in the bloodstream, it will affect the activity only of its target cells; that is, cells with receptors for that particular hormone. Once the hormone binds to the receptor, a chain of events is initiated that leads to the target cells response. Hormones play a critical role in the regulation of physiological processesbecauseofthetargetcellresponsestheyregulate.

Aminehormonesaresynthesizedfromtheaminoacidstryptophanortyrosine. Anexampleofahormonederivedfrom tryptophan is melatonin, which is secreted by the pineal gland and helps regulate circadian rhythm. Tyrosine derivatives includethemetabolism-regulatingthyroidhormones, aswellasthecatecholamines, suchasepinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are secreted by the adrenal medulla and play a role in the fight-or-flight response, whereasdopamineissecretedbythehypothalamusandinhibitsthereleaseofcertainanteriorpituitaryhormones. 692 CHAPTER 17 THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM Peptide and Protein Hormones Whereastheaminehormonesarederivedfromasingleaminoacid, peptideandproteinhormonesconsistofmultipleamino acids that link to form an amino acid chain. Peptide hormones consist of short chains of amino acids, whereas Protein hormones are longer polypeptides. Both types are synthesized like other body proteins: DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which is translated into an amino acid chain. Examplesofpeptidehormonesincludeantidiuretichormone(ADH), apituitaryhormoneimportantinfluidbalance, and atrial-natriuretic peptide, which is produced by the Heart and helps to decrease Blood Hypertension. Some examples of Protein hormones include growth hormone, which is produced by the pituitary gland, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which has an attached carbohydrate group and is thus classified as a glycoprotein. FSH helps stimulate the maturation of eggs in the ovaries and sperm in the testes. Steroid Hormones The primary hormones derived from lipids are steroids. Steroid hormones are derived from the lipid cholesterol. For example, the reproductive hormones testosterone and the estrogenswhich are produced by the gonads (testes and ovaries)are steroid hormones. The adrenal glands produce the steroid hormone aldosterone, which is involved in osmoregulation, and cortisol, which plays a role in metabolism. Like cholesterol, steroid hormones are not soluble in Water (they are hydrophobic). Because Blood is Water-based, lipid-derived hormones must travel to their target cell bound to a transport Protein. This more complex structure extends thehalf-lifeofsteroidhormonesmuchlongerthanthatofhormonesderivedfromaminoacids.

Steroidhormonesarederivedfromcholesterolandthereforecanreadilydiffusethroughthelipidbilayer of the cell membrane to reach the intracellular receptor (Figure 17. 4). Thyroid hormones, which contain benzene rings studded with iodine, are also lipid-soluble and can enter the cell. Thelocationofsteroidandthyroidhormonebindingdiffersslightly: asteroidhormonemaybindtoitsreceptorwithin the cytosol or within the nucleus. In either case, this binding generates a hormone-receptor complex that moves toward thechromatininthecellnucleusandbindstoaparticularsegmentofthecellsDNA. Incontrast, thyroidhormonesbind to receptors already bound to DNA. For both steroid and thyroid hormones, binding of the hormone-receptor complex with DNA triggers transcription of a target gene to mRNA, which moves to the cytosol and directs Protein synthesis by ribosomes.

Pathways Involving Cell Membrane Hormone Receptors Hydrophilic, or Water-soluble, hormones are unable to diffuse through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and must therefore pass on their message to a receptor located at the surface of the cell. Except for thyroid hormones, which are lipid-soluble, all amino acidderived hormones bind to cell membrane receptors that are located, at least in part, on the extracellularsurfaceofthecellmembrane. Therefore, theydonotdirectlyaffectthetranscriptionoftargetgenes, butinstead initiateasignalingcascadethatiscarriedoutbyamoleculecalledasecondmessenger. Inthiscase, thehormoneiscalled afirst messenger. The second messenger used by most hormones is cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In the cAMP second messenger system, a Water-soluble hormone binds to its receptor in the cell membrane (Step 1 in Figure 17. 5). This receptor is associated with an intracellular component called a G Protein, and binding of the hormone activates the GProtein component (Step 2). The activated G Protein in turn activates an enzyme called adenylyl cyclase, also known as adenylate cyclase (Step 3), which converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cAMP (Step 4). As the second messenger, cAMPactivatesatypeofenzymecalledaproteinkinasethatispresentinthecytosol(Step5). Activatedproteinkinases initiateaphosphorylationcascade, inwhichmultipleproteinkinasesphosphorylate(addaphosphategroupto)numerous and various cellular proteins, including other enzymes (Step 6). 694 CHAPTER 17 THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM Figure 17. 5 Binding of Water-Soluble Hormones Water-soluble hormones cannot diffuse through the cell membrane. These hormones must bind to a surface cell-membrane receptor. The receptor then initiates a cellsignalingpathwaywithinthecellinvolvingGproteins, adenylylcyclase, thesecondarymessengercyclicAMP(cAMP), and Protein kinases. In the final step, these Protein kinases phosphorylate proteins in the cytoplasm. This activates proteins in the cell that carry out the changes specified by the hormone. Thephosphorylationofcellularproteinscantriggerawidevarietyofeffects, fromnutrientmetabolismtothesynthesis ofdifferenthormonesandotherproducts. Theeffectsvaryaccordingtothetypeoftargetcell, theGproteinsandkinases involved, and the phosphorylation of proteins. Examples of hormones that use cAMP as a second messenger include calcitonin, whichisimportantforboneconstructionandregulatingbloodcalciumlevels; glucagon, whichplaysarolein Blood glucose levels; and thyroid-stimulating hormone, which causes the release of T3and T4from the thyroid gland. Overall, the phosphorylation cascade significantly increases the efficiency, speed, and specificity of the hormonal response, as thousands of signaling events can be initiated simultaneously in response to a very Low concentration of hormoneinthebloodstream. However, thedurationofthehormonesignalisshort, ascAMPisquicklydeactivatedbythe enzymephosphodiesterase(PDE), whichislocatedinthecytosol. TheactionofPDEhelpstoensurethatatargetcells response ceases quickly unless new hormones arrive at the cell membrane. Importantly, there are also G proteins that decrease the levels of cAMP in the cell in response to hormone binding. Forexample, whengrowthhormoneinhibitinghormone(GHIH), alsoknownassomatostatin, bindstoitsreceptorsinthe pituitary gland, the level of cAMP decreases, thereby inhibiting the secretion of human growth hormone. Not all Water-soluble hormones initiate the cAMP second messenger system. One common alternative system uses calcium ions as a second messenger.",

Factors Affecting Target Cell Response You will recall that target cells must have receptors specific to a given hormone if that hormone is to trigger a response. Butseveralotherfactorsinfluencethetargetcellresponse. Forexample, thepresenceofasignificantlevelofahormone circulating in the bloodstream can cause its target cells to decrease their number of receptors for that hormone. This process is calleddownregulation, and itallows cellsto becomeless reactiveto theexcessivehormonelevels.

The antagonistic effect, in which two hormones have opposing effects. A familiar example is the effect of two pancreatic hormones, insulin and glucagon. Insulin increases the Livers storage of glucose as glycogen, decreasing Blood glucose, whereas glucagon stimulates the breakdown of glycogen stores, increasing Blood glucose. Regulation of Hormone Secretion To prevent abnormal hormone levels and a potential disease state, hormone levels must be tightly controlled. The body maintains this control by balancing hormone production and degradation. Feedback loops govern the initiation and maintenance of most hormone secretion in response to various stimuli. Role of Feedback Loops The contribution of feedback loops to homeostasis will only be briefly reviewed here. Positive feedback loops are characterized by the release of additional hormone in response to an original hormone release. The release of oxytocin duringchildbirthisapositivefeedbackloop. Theinitialreleaseofoxytocinbeginstosignaltheuterinemusclestocontract, which pushes the fetus toward the cervix, causing it to stretch. This, in turn, signals the pituitary gland to release more oxytocin, causing labor contractions to intensify. The release of oxytocin decreases after the birth of the child.

Anexampleofanegativefeedbackloopisthereleaseofglucocorticoid hormonesfromtheadrenalglands, asdirectedbythehypothalamusandpituitarygland. Asglucocorticoidconcentrations in the Blood rise, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland reduce their signaling to the adrenal glands to prevent additional glucocorticoid secretion (Figure 17. 6). 696 CHAPTER 17 THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM Figure 17. 6 Negative Feedback Loop The release of adrenal glucocorticoids is stimulated by the release of hormones from the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. This signaling is inhibited when glucocorticoid levels become elevated by causing negative signals to the pituitary gland and hypothalamus.

Acommonexample of neural stimuli is the activation of the fight-or-flight response by the sympathetic nervous system.

    "Hypothalamichormonesaresecretedbyneurons, butentertheanteriorpituitarythroughbloodvessels(Figure17. 9). Within the infundibulum is a bridge of capillaries that connects the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary. This network, called the hypophyseal portal system, allows hypothalamic hormones to be transported to the anterior pituitary without first entering the systemic circulation. The system originates from the superior hypophyseal artery, which branches off the carotid arteries and transports Blood to the hypothalamus. The branches of the superior hypophyseal artery form the hypophyseal portal system (see Figure 17. 9). Hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting hormones travel through a primary capillaryplexustotheportalveins, whichcarrythemintotheanteriorpituitary. Hormonesproducedbytheanteriorpituitary (in response to releasing hormones) enter a secondary capillary plexus, and from there drain into the circulation. This content is available for free at or at CHAPTER 17 THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 701 Figure 17. 9 Anterior Pituitary The anterior pituitary manufactures seven hormones. The hypothalamus produces separate hormones that stimulate or inhibit hormone production in the anterior pituitary. Hormones from the hypothalamus reach the anterior pituitary via the hypophyseal portal system. The anterior pituitary produces seven hormones. These are the growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), beta endorphin, andprolactin. Ofthehormonesoftheanteriorpituitary, TSH, ACTH, FSH, andLHarecollectivelyreferredto as tropic hormones (trope- turning) because they turn on or off the function of other endocrine glands. Growth Hormone Theendocrinesystemregulatesthegrowthofthehumanbody, proteinsynthesis, andcellularreplication. Amajorhormone involved in this process is growth hormone (GH), also called somatotropina Protein hormone produced and secreted bytheanteriorpituitarygland.

GHlevelsarecontrolledbythereleaseofGHRHandGHIH(alsoknown as somatostatin) from the hypothalamus. 702 CHAPTER 17 THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM Figure 17. 10 Hormonal Regulation of Growth Growth hormone (GH) directly accelerates the rate of Protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and bones.

Skeletal muscle and cartilage cells are particularly sensitive to stimulation from IGFs. Dysfunction of the endocrine systems control of growth can result in several disorders.

AbnormallylowlevelsofGHinchildrencan cause growth impairmenta disorder calledpituitary dwarfism(also known as growth hormone deficiency). Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone The activity of the thyroid gland is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), also called thyrotropin. TSH is released from the anterior pituitary in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. As discussed shortly, it triggers the secretion of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. In a classic negative feedback loop, elevated levels of thyroid hormones in the bloodstream then trigger a drop in production of TRH and subsequently TSH.

Giventheseroles, itisnotsurprising that Blood calcium levels are tightly regulated by the endocrine system. The organs involved in the regulation are the parathyroid glands. 17. 5 The Parathyroid Glands By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the location and structure of the parathyroid glands Describe the hormonal control of Blood calcium levels Discuss the physiological response of parathyroid dysfunction The parathyroid glands are tiny, round structures usually found embedded in the posterior surface of the thyroid gland (Figure 17. 15). A thick connective tissue capsule separates the glands from the thyroid tissue. Most people have four parathyroidglands, butoccasionallytherearemoreintissuesoftheneckorchest.

TheparathyroidglandsproduceandsecretePTH, apeptidehormone, inresponsetolowbloodcalciumlevels(Figure 17. 16). parathyroid hormone secretion causes the release of calcium from the bones by stimulating osteoclasts, which secrete enzymes that degrade bone and release calcium into the interstitial fluid. parathyroid hormone also inhibits osteoblasts, the cells involved in bone deposition, therebysparingbloodcalcium. PTHcausesincreasedreabsorptionofcalcium(andmagnesium)inthekidney tubules from the Urine filtrate. In addition, parathyroid hormone initiates the production of the steroid hormone calcitriol (also known as 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D), which is the active form of vitamin D3, in the kidneys. Calcitriol then stimulates increased absorption of dietary calcium by the intestines. A negative feedback loop regulates the levels of parathyroid hormone, with rising Blood calcium levels inhibiting further release of parathyroid hormone. 712 CHAPTER 17 THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM Figure17. 16ParathyroidHormoneinMaintainingBloodCalciumHomeostasis Parathyroidhormoneincreases Blood calcium levels when they drop too Low. Conversely, calcitonin, which is released from the thyroid gland, decreasesbloodcalciumlevelswhentheybecometoohigh. Thesetwomechanismsconstantlymaintainbloodcalcium concentration at homeostasis. Abnormally High activity of the parathyroid gland can cause hyperparathyroidism, a disorder caused by an overproduction of parathyroid hormone that results in excessive calcium reabsorption from bone. Hyperparathyroidism can significantly decrease bone density, leading to spontaneous fractures or deformities. As Blood calcium levels rise, cell membrane permeabilitytosodiumisdecreased, andtheresponsivenessofthenervoussystemisreduced. Atthesametime, calcium deposits may collect in the bodys tissues and organs, impairing their functioning. In contrast, abnormally Low Blood calcium levels may be caused by parathyroid hormone deficiency, called hypoparathyroidism, which may develop following injury or surgery involving the thyroid gland. Low Blood calcium increases membrane permeability to Sodium, resulting in muscle twitching, cramping, spasms, or convulsions. Severe deficits can paralyze muscles, including those involved in breathing, and can be fatal. Whenbloodcalciumlevelsarehigh, calcitoninisproducedandsecretedbytheparafollicularcellsofthethyroidgland.

Eachregionsecretes its own set of hormones. The adrenal cortex, as a component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, secretes steroid hormones important for the regulation of the long-term stress response, Blood Hypertension and Blood volume, nutrient uptake and storage, fluid and electrolyte balance, and inflammation. The HPA axis involves the stimulation of hormone release of adrenocorticotropichormone(ACTH)fromthepituitarybythehypothalamus. ACTHthenstimulatestheadrenalcortexto produce the hormone cortisol. This pathway will be discussed in more detail below. The adrenal medulla is neuroendocrine tissue composed of postganglionic sympathetic nervous system (SNS) neurons. It is really an extension of the autonomic nervous system, which regulates homeostasis in the body. The sympathomedullary (SAM) pathway involves the stimulation of the medulla by impulses from the hypothalamus via neurons from the thoracic spinal cord. The medulla is stimulated to secrete the amine hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine. 714 CHAPTER 17 THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM Oneofthemajorfunctionsoftheadrenalglandistorespondtostress.

Their functionistopreparethebodyforextremephysicalexertion. Oncethisstressisrelieved, thebodyquicklyreturnstonormal. The section on the adrenal medulla covers this response in more detail. If the stress is not soon relieved, the body adapts to the stress in the second stage called the stage of resistance. If a person is starving for example, the body may send signals to the gastrointestinal tract to maximize the absorption of nutrients from food. If the stress continues for a longer term however, the body responds with symptoms quite different than the fightor-flight response. During the stage of exhaustion, individuals may begin to suffer depression, the suppression of their immuneresponse, severefatigue, orevenafatalheartattack. Thesesymptomsaremediatedbythehormonesoftheadrenal cortex, especially cortisol, released as a result of signals from the HPA axis.

The cells of the zona fasciculata produce hormones called glucocorticoids because of their role in glucose metabolism. The most important of these is cortisol, some of which the Liver converts to cortisone. A glucocorticoid produced in much smaller amounts is corticosterone. In response to long-term stressors, thehypothalamussecretesCRH, whichinturntriggersthereleaseofACTHbytheanteriorpituitary. ACTHtriggersthe release of the glucocorticoids. Their overall effect is to inhibit tissue building while stimulating the breakdown of stored nutrientstomaintainadequatefuelsupplies.

Thesedrugsreflectanotherroleofcortisolthedownregulation of the immune system, which inhibits the inflammatory response. Hormones of the Zona Reticularis The deepest region of the adrenal cortex is the zona reticularis, which produces small amounts of a class of steroid sex hormonescalledandrogens. Duringpubertyandmostofadulthood, androgensareproducedinthegonads. Theandrogens produced in the zona reticularis supplement the gonadal androgens. They are produced in response to ACTH from the anteriorpituitaryandareconvertedinthetissuestotestosteroneorestrogens. Inadultwomen, theymaycontributetothe sexdrive, buttheirfunctioninadultmenisnotwellunderstood. Inpost-menopausalwomen, asthefunctionsoftheovaries decline, the main source of estrogens becomes the androgens produced by the zona reticularis. Adrenal Medulla As noted earlier, the adrenal cortex releases glucocorticoids in response to long-term stress such as severe illness. In contrast, the adrenal medulla releases its hormones in response to acute, short-term stress mediated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The medullary tissue is composed of unique postganglionic SNS neurons called chromaffin cells, which are large and irregularly shaped, and produce the neurotransmitters epinephrine (also called adrenaline) and norepinephrine (or noradrenaline). Epinephrineisproducedingreaterquantitiesapproximatelya4to1ratiowithnorepinephrineandisthe morepowerfulhormone. Becausethechromaffincellsreleaseepinephrineandnorepinephrineintothesystemiccirculation, where they travel widely and exert effects on distant cells, they are considered hormones.

Finally, an antioxidant role of melatonin is the subject of current research. Jet lag occurs when a person travels across several time zones and feels sleepy during the day or wakeful at night. Traveling across multiple time zones significantly disturbs the light-dark cycle regulated by melatonin.

Hormones regulateboththestorageandtheutilizationofglucoseasrequired. Receptorslocatedinthepancreassensebloodglucose levels, and subsequently the pancreatic cells secrete glucagon or insulin to maintain normal levels. Glucagon Receptors in the pancreas can sense the decline in Blood glucose levels, such as during periods of fasting or during prolonged labor or exercise (Figure 17. 19). In response, the alpha cells of the pancreas secrete the hormone glucagon, which has several effects: Itstimulatesthelivertoconvertitsstoresofglycogenbackintoglucose. Thisresponseisknownasglycogenolysis. The glucose is then released into the circulation for use by body cells. Itstimulatesthelivertotakeupaminoacidsfromthebloodandconvertthemintoglucose.

If Blood glucose concentration rises above this range, insulin is released, which stimulates body cells to remove glucose from the Blood. If Blood glucose concentration drops below this range, glucagon is released, which stimulates body cells to release glucose into the Blood. Insulin The primary function of insulin is to facilitate the uptake of glucose into body cells.

Theendocrineglandsthatproducethesteroidhormones, suchasthegonadsandadrenalcortex, arisefromthemesoderm. Incontrast, endocrineglandsthatarisefromtheendoderm andectodermproducetheamine, peptide, andproteinhormones. Thepituitaryglandarisesfromtwodistinctareasofthe ectoderm: theanteriorpituitaryglandarisesfromtheoralectoderm, whereastheposteriorpituitaryglandarisesfromthe neural ectoderm at the base of the hypothalamus. The pineal gland also arises from the ectoderm. The two structures of the adrenal glands arise from two different germ layers: the adrenal cortex from the mesoderm and the adrenal medulla fromectodermneuralcells. Theendodermgivesrisetothethyroidandparathyroidglands, aswellasthepancreasandthe thymus. As the body ages, changes occur that affect the endocrine system, sometimes altering the production, secretion, and catabolismofhormones. Forexample, thestructureoftheanteriorpituitaryglandchangesasvascularizationdecreasesand theconnectivetissuecontentincreaseswithincreasingage. Thisrestructuringaffectstheglandshormoneproduction. For example, theamountofhumangrowthhormonethatisproduceddeclineswithage, resultinginthereducedmusclemass commonly observed in the elderly. The adrenal glands also undergo changes as the body ages; as fibrous tissue increases, the production of cortisol and aldosterone decreases. Interestingly, the production and secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine remain normal throughout the aging process. A well-known example of the aging process affecting an endocrine gland is menopause and the decline of ovarian function. With increasing age, the ovaries decrease in both size and weight and become progressively less sensitive to gonadotropins. Thisgraduallycausesadecreaseinestrogenandprogesteronelevels, leadingtomenopauseandtheinability toreproduce. Lowlevelsofestrogensandprogesteronearealsoassociatedwithsomediseasestates, suchasosteoporosis, atherosclerosis, and hyperlipidemia, or abnormal Blood lipid levels. Testosteronelevelsalsodeclinewithage, aconditioncalledandropause(orviropause); however, thisdeclineismuch less dramatic than the decline of estrogens in women, and much more gradual, rarely affecting sperm production until veryoldage. Althoughthismeansthatmalesmaintaintheirabilitytofatherchildrenfordecadeslongerthanfemales, the quantity, quality, and motility of their sperm is often reduced. As the body ages, the thyroid gland produces less of the thyroid hormones, causing a gradual decrease in the basal metabolicrate. Thelowermetabolicratereducestheproductionofbodyheatandincreaseslevelsofbodyfat. Parathyroid hormones, on the other hand, increase with age. This may be because of reduced dietary calcium levels, causing a compensatoryincreaseinparathyroidhormone. However, increasedparathyroidhormonelevelscombinedwithdecreased 726 CHAPTER 17 THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM levels of calcitonin (and estrogens in women) can lead to osteoporosis as parathyroid hormone stimulates demineralization of bones to increase Blood calcium levels.

Inaddition, increasingglucoseintolerancemayoccurbecauseofagradualdeclineincellularinsulin sensitivity. Almost 27 percent of Americans aged 65 and older have Diabetes.",
    "1An Overview of the Endocrine System The endocrine system consists of cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones critical to homeostasis. The body coordinatesitsfunctionsthroughtwomajortypesofcommunication: neuralandendocrine. Neuralcommunicationincludes both electrical and chemical signaling between neurons and target cells. Endocrine communication involves chemical signaling via the release of hormones into the extracellular fluid. From there, hormones diffuse into the bloodstream and may travel to distant body regions, where they elicit a response in target cells. Endocrine glands are ductless glands that secretehormones. Manyorgansofthebodywithotherprimaryfunctionssuchastheheart, stomach, andkidneysalso have hormone-secreting cells. 17. 2Hormones Hormonesarederivedfromaminoacidsorlipids. Aminehormonesoriginatefromtheaminoacidstryptophanortyrosine. Larger amino acid hormones include peptides and Protein hormones. Steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol. Steroid hormones and thyroid hormone are lipid soluble. All other amino acidderived hormones are Water soluble. Hydrophobic hormones are able to diffuse through the membrane and interact with an intracellular receptor. In contrast, hydrophilichormonesmustinteractwithcellmembranereceptors. ThesearetypicallyassociatedwithaGprotein, which becomesactivatedwhenthehormonebindsthereceptor. Thisinitiatesasignalingcascadethatinvolvesasecondmessenger, suchascyclicadenosinemonophosphate(cAMP).

Finally, aneuralstimulusoccurswhenanerveimpulsepromptsthe secretion or inhibition of a hormone. 17. 3The Pituitary Gland and Hypothalamus Thehypothalamuspituitarycomplexislocatedinthediencephalonofthebrain. Thehypothalamusandthepituitarygland are connected by a structure called the infundibulum, which contains vasculature and nerve axons. The pituitary gland is divided into two distinct structures with different embryonic origins. The posterior lobe houses the axon terminals of hypothalamic neurons. It stores and releases into the bloodstream two hypothalamic hormones: oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone(ADH). Theanteriorlobeisconnectedtothehypothalamusbyvasculatureintheinfundibulumandproducesand secretessixhormones. Theirsecretionisregulated, however, byreleasingandinhibitinghormonesfromthehypothalamus. The six anterior pituitary hormones are: growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and prolactin (PRL). 17. 4The Thyroid Gland The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ located in the neck anterior to the trachea. Its hormones regulate basal metabolism, oxygen use, nutrient metabolism, the production of ATP, and calcium homeostasis. They also contribute to proteinsynthesisandthenormalgrowthanddevelopmentofbodytissues, includingmaturationofthenervoussystem, and theyincreasethebodyssensitivitytocatecholamines. Thethyroidhormonestriiodothyronine(T3)andthyroxine(T4)are producedandsecretedbythethyroidglandinresponsetothyroid-stimulatinghormone(TSH)fromtheanteriorpituitary. SynthesisoftheaminoacidderivedT3andT4hormonesrequiresiodine. Insufficientamountsofiodineinthedietcanlead to goiter, cretinism, and many other disorders. 17. 5The Parathyroid Glands Calcium is required for a variety of important physiologic processes, including neuromuscular functioning; thus, Blood calciumlevelsarecloselyregulated. Theparathyroidglandsaresmallstructureslocatedontheposteriorthyroidglandthat produceparathyroidhormone(parathyroid hormone), whichregulatesbloodcalciumlevels. Lowbloodcalciumlevelscausetheproduction andsecretionofPTH. Incontrast, elevatedbloodcalciumlevelsinhibitsecretionofPTHandtriggersecretionofthethyroid hormone calcitonin. Underproduction of parathyroid hormone can result in hypoparathyroidism. In contrast, overproduction of parathyroid hormone can result in hyperparathyroidism. 17. 6The Adrenal Glands The adrenal glands, located superior to each Kidney, consist of two regions: the adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla. The adrenal cortexthe outer layer of the glandproduces mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. The adrenal medulla at the core of the gland produces epinephrine and norepinephrine. Theadrenalglandsmediateashort-termstressresponseandalong-termstressresponse. Aperceivedthreatresultsin thesecretionofepinephrineandnorepinephrinefromtheadrenalmedulla, whichmediatethefight-or-flightresponse. The long-term stress response is mediated by the secretion of CRH from the hypothalamus, which triggers ACTH, which in turnstimulatesthesecretionofcorticosteroidsfromtheadrenalcortex. Themineralocorticoids, chieflyaldosterone, cause Sodium and fluid retention, which increases Blood volume and Blood Hypertension. 17. 7The Pineal Gland The pineal gland is an endocrine structure of the diencephalon of the brain, and is located inferior and posterior to the thalamus. It is made up of pinealocytes. These cells produce and secrete the hormone melatonin in response to Low light levels. High Blood levels of melatonin induce drowsiness. Jet lag, caused by traveling across several time zones, occurs because melatonin synthesis takes several days to readjust to the light-dark patterns in the new environment. 17. 8Gonadal and Placental Hormones The male and female reproductive system is regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)producedbytheanteriorlobeofthepituitaryglandinresponsetogonadotropin-releasinghormone(GnRH)fromthe hypothalamus. Inmales, FSHstimulatesspermmaturation, whichisinhibitedbythehormoneinhibin. Thesteroidhormone testosterone, a type of androgen, is released in response to LH and is responsible for the maturation and maintenance of themalereproductivesystem, aswellasthedevelopmentofmalesecondarysexcharacteristics.",
    "Infemales, FSHpromotes egg maturation and LH signals the secretion of the female sex hormones, the estrogens and progesterone. Both of these hormones are important in the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system, as well as maintaining pregnancy. The placenta develops during early pregnancy, and secretes several hormones important for maintaining the pregnancy. 732 CHAPTER 17 THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 17. 9The Endocrine Pancreas Thepancreashasbothexocrineandendocrinefunctions.

For example, the walls of the atria of the Heart produce the hormone atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), the gastrointestinal tract produces the hormones gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin, whichaidindigestion, andthekidneysproduceerythropoietin(erythropoietin), whichstimulatestheformationofredbloodcells. Even bone, adipose tissue, and the skin have secondary endocrine functions. 17. 11Development and Aging of the Endocrine System The endocrine system originates from all three germ layers of the embryo, including the endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm. In general, different hormone classes arise from distinct germ layers. Aging affects the endocrine glands, potentiallyaffectinghormoneproductionandsecretion, andcancausedisease. Theproductionofhormones, suchashuman growth hormone, cortisol, aldosterone, sex hormones, and the thyroid hormones, decreases with age. INTERACTIVE LINK QUESTIONS 1.

    "The extracellular matrix, called plasma, makes Blood unique among connective tissues because it is fluid. This fluid, which is mostly Water, perpetually suspends the formed elements and enables them to circulate throughout the body within the cardiovascular system. Functions of Blood The primary function of Blood is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to and remove wastes from body cells, but that is only the beginning of the story. The specific functions of Blood also include defense, distribution of heat, and maintenance of homeostasis. Transportation Nutrientsfromthefoodsyoueatareabsorbedinthedigestivetract. Mostofthesetravelinthebloodstreamdirectlytothe Liver, wheretheyareprocessedandreleasedbackintothebloodstreamfordeliverytobodycells. Oxygenfromtheairyou breathediffusesintotheblood, whichmovesfromthelungstotheheart, whichthenpumpsitouttotherestofthebody. Moreover, endocrine glands scattered throughout the body release their products, called hormones, into the bloodstream, whichcarriesthemtodistanttargetcells. Bloodalsopicksupcellularwastesandbyproducts, andtransportsthemtovarious organsforremoval. Forinstance, bloodmovescarbondioxidetothelungsforexhalationfromthebody, andvariouswaste products are transported to the kidneys and Liver for excretion from the body in the form of Urine or bile. Defense Many types of WBCs protect the body from external threats, such as disease-causing bacteria that have entered the bloodstream in a wound. Other WBCs seek out and destroy internal threats, such as cells with mutated DNA that could multiply to become cancerous, or body cells infected with viruses. Whendamagetothevesselsresultsinbleeding, bloodplateletsandcertainproteinsdissolvedintheplasma, thefluid portionoftheblood, interacttoblocktherupturedareasofthebloodvesselsinvolved.

Asbloodpassesthroughthevesselsoftheskin, heatwouldbe dissipatedtotheenvironment, andthebloodreturningtoyourbodycorewouldbecooler. Incontrast, onacoldday, Blood is diverted away from the skin to maintain a warmer body core. In extreme cases, this may result in frostbite. Bloodalsohelpstomaintainthechemicalbalanceofthebody. Proteinsandothercompoundsinbloodactasbuffers, which thereby help to regulate the pH of body tissues. Blood also helps to regulate the Water content of body cells.

The hematocrit of any one sample can vary significantly, however, about 3650 percent, according to gender and other factors. Normal hematocrit values for females range from 37 to 47, withameanvalueof41; formales, hematocritrangesfrom42to52, withameanof47.

Blood Plasma Like other fluids in the body, plasma is composed primarily of Water: In fact, it is about 92 percent Water. Dissolved or suspended within this Water is a mixture of substances, most of which are proteins. There are literally hundreds of substances dissolved or suspended in the plasma, although many of them are found only in very small quantities. 740 CHAPTER 18 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Blood Visit this site ( for a list of normal levels established for many of the substancesfoundinasampleofblood.

Plasma Proteins About7percentofthevolumeofplasmanearlyallthatisnotwaterismadeofproteins. Theseincludeseveralplasma proteins(proteinsthatareuniquetotheplasma), plusamuchsmallernumberofregulatoryproteins, includingenzymesand some hormones. The major components of plasma are summarized inFigure 18. 3. The three major groups of plasma proteins are as follows: Albuministhemostabundantoftheplasmaproteins. Manufacturedbytheliver, albuminmoleculesserveasbinding proteinstransportvehiclesforfattyacidsandsteroidhormones. Recallthatlipidsarehydrophobic; however, their binding to albumin enables their transport in the watery plasma. Albumin is also the most significant contributor to the osmotic Hypertension of Blood; that is, its presence holds Water inside the Blood vessels and draws Water from the tissues, across Blood vessel walls, and into the bloodstream. This in turn helps to maintain both Blood volume and bloodpressure. Albuminnormallyaccountsforapproximately54percentofthetotalplasmaproteincontent, inclinical levels of 3. 55. 0 grams per deciliter Blood. Thesecondmostcommonplasmaproteinsaretheglobulins.

Fibrinogenaccounts for about 7 percent of the total plasma Protein volume, in clinical levels of 0. 20. 45 grams per deciliter Blood. Other Plasma Solutes In addition to proteins, plasma contains a wide variety of other substances. These include various electrolytes, such as Sodium, Potassium, and calcium ions; dissolved gases, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen; various organic nutrients, suchasvitamins, lipids, glucose, andaminoacids; andmetabolicwastes.

When more than a few drops of Blood are required, phlebotomists perform a venipuncture, typically of a surface vein in the arm. They perform a capillary stick on a finger, an earlobe, or the heel of an infant when only a small quantity of bloodisrequired. Anarterialstickiscollectedfromanarteryandusedtoanalyzebloodgases.

Medical or clinical laboratories employ a variety of individuals in technical positions: Medical technologists (MT), also known as clinicallaboratory technologists (CLT), typicallyhold a bachelors degree and certification from an accredited training program. They perform a wide variety of tests on various body fluids, including Blood. The information they provide is essential to the primary care providers in determining a diagnosis and in monitoring the course of a disease and response to treatment.

Althoughonetypeofleukocytecalledmemorycellscansurviveforyears, mosterythrocytes, leukocytes, andplateletsnormallyliveonlyafewhourstoafewweeks. Thus, thebodymustformnew bloodcellsandplateletsquicklyandcontinuously. Whenyoudonateaunitofbloodduringablooddrive(approximately 475 mL, or about 1 pint), your body typically replaces the donated plasma within 24 hours, but it takes about 4 to 6 weekstoreplacethebloodcells. Thisrestrictsthefrequencywithwhichdonorscancontributetheirblood. Theprocessby whichthisreplacementoccursiscalledhemopoiesis, orhematopoiesis(fromtheGreekroothaima-Blood; -poiesis production). Sites of Hemopoiesis Prior to birth, hemopoiesis occurs in a number of tissues, beginning with the yolk sac of the developing embryo, and continuing in the fetal Liver, spleen, lymphatic tissue, and eventually the red bone marrow. Following birth, most hemopoiesisoccursintheredmarrow, aconnectivetissuewithinthespacesofspongy(cancellous)bonetissue. Inchildren, hemopoiesiscanoccurinthemedullarycavityoflongbones; inadults, theprocessislargelyrestrictedtothecranialand pelvic bones, the vertebrae, the sternum, and the proximal epiphyses of the femur and humerus. Throughout adulthood, the Liver and spleen maintain their ability to generate the formed elements. This process is referred to as extramedullary hemopoiesis (meaning hemopoiesis outside the medullary cavity of adult bones). When a disease such as bone cancer destroys the bone marrow, causing hemopoiesis to fail, extramedullary hemopoiesis may be initiated. Differentiation of Formed Elements from Stem Cells Allformedelementsarisefromstemcellsoftheredbonemarrow. Recallthatstemcellsundergomitosispluscytokinesis (cellulardivision)togiverisetonewdaughtercells: Oneoftheseremainsastemcellandtheotherdifferentiatesintoone of any number of diverse cell types.

Beneaththislevel, themesenchymalcellisastemcell thatdevelopsonlyintotypesofconnectivetissue, includingfibrousconnectivetissue, bone, cartilage, andblood, butnot epithelium, muscle, and nervous tissue. One step lower on the hierarchy of stem cells is the hemopoietic stem cell, or hemocytoblast. All of the formed elements of Blood originate from this specific type of cell. This content is available for free at or at CHAPTER 18 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Blood 743 Hemopoiesis begins when the hemopoietic stem cell is exposed to appropriate chemical stimuli collectively called hemopoietic growth factors, which prompt it to divide and differentiate. One daughter cell remains a hemopoietic stem cell, allowinghemopoiesistocontinue. Theotherdaughtercellbecomeseitheroftwotypesofmorespecializedstemcells (Figure 18. 4): Lymphoid stem cells give rise to a class of leukocytes known as lymphocytes, which include the various T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, all of which function in immunity. However, hemopoiesis of lymphocytes progressessomewhatdifferentlyfromtheprocessfortheotherformedelements. Inbrief, lymphoidstemcellsquickly migrate from the bone marrow to lymphatic tissues, including the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus, where their production and differentiation continues. B cells are so named since they mature in the bone marrow, while T cells mature in the thymus. Myeloidstemcellsgiverisetoalltheotherformedelements, includingtheerythrocytes; megakaryocytesthatproduce platelets; andamyeloblastlineagethatgivesrisetomonocytesandthreeformsofgranularleukocytes: neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. Figure 18. 4 Hematopoietic System of Bone Marrow Hemopoiesis is the proliferation and differentiation of the formed elements of Blood. Lymphoid and myeloid stem cells do not immediately divide and differentiate into mature formed elements. As you can see in Figure 18.",
    "As you can see in Figure 18. 4, there are several intermediate stages of precursor cells (literally, forerunner cells), many of which can be recognized by their names, which have the suffix -blast. For instance, megakaryoblasts are the precursors ofmegakaryocytes, andproerythroblastsbecomereticulocytes, whichejecttheirnucleusandmostotherorganellesbefore maturing into erythrocytes. Hemopoietic Growth Factors Development from stem cells to precursor cells to mature cells is again initiated by hemopoietic growth factors. These include the following: Erythropoietin(erythropoietin)isaglycoproteinhormonesecretedbytheinterstitialfibroblastcellsofthekidneysinresponse tolowoxygenlevels. Itpromptstheproductionoferythrocytes. SomeathletesusesyntheticEPOasaperformanceenhancing drug (called Blood doping) to increase red blood cell counts and subsequently increase oxygen delivery to tissues throughoutthebody. EPOisabannedsubstanceinmostorganizedsports, butitisalsousedmedicallyinthetreatment of certain anemia, specifically those triggered by certain types of cancer, and other disorders in which increased erythrocyte counts and oxygen levels are desirable. 744 CHAPTER 18 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Blood Thrombopoietin, anotherglycoproteinhormone, isproducedbytheliverandkidneys. Ittriggersthedevelopmentof megakaryocytes into platelets. Cytokinesareglycoproteinssecretedbyawidevarietyofcells, includingredbonemarrow, leukocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. They act locally as autocrine or paracrine factors, stimulating the proliferation of progenitor cells and helping to stimulate both nonspecific and specific resistance to disease. There are two major subtypes of cytokines known as colony-stimulating factors and interleukins. Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) are glycoproteins that act locally, as autocrine or paracrine factors. Some trigger the differentiation of myeloblasts into granular leukocytes, namely, neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. These are referred to as granulocyte CSFs. A different CSF induces the production of monocytes, calledmonocyteCSFs. BothgranulocytesandmonocytesarestimulatedbyGM-CSF; granulocytes, monocytes, platelets, anderythrocytesarestimulatedbymulti-CSF. Syntheticformsofthesehormonesareoftenadministered to patients with various forms of cancer who are receiving chemotherapy to revive their white blood cell counts. Interleukins are another class of cytokine signaling molecules important in hemopoiesis. They were initially thoughttobesecreteduniquelybyleukocytesandtocommunicateonlywithotherleukocytes, andwerenamed accordingly, butarenowknowntobeproducedbyavarietyofcellsincludingbonemarrowandendothelium. Researchersnowsuspectthatinterleukinsmayplayotherrolesinbodyfunctioning, includingdifferentiationand maturationofcells, producingimmunityandinflammation. Todate, morethanadozeninterleukinshavebeen identified, with others likely to follow. They are generally numbered IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, etc. Blood Doping Initsoriginalintent, thetermblooddopingwasusedtodescribethepracticeofinjectingbytransfusionsupplemental RBCs intoanindividual, typicallytoenhanceperformanceinasport. AdditionalRBCs would delivermoreoxygen tothetissues, providingextraaerobiccapacity, clinicallyreferredtoasVO2max. Thesourceofthecellswaseither from the recipient (autologous) or from a donor with compatible Blood (homologous). This practice was aided by thewell-developedtechniquesofharvesting, concentrating, andfreezingoftheRBCsthatcouldbelaterthawedand injected, yet still retain their functionality. These practices are considered illegal in virtually all sports and run the riskofinfection, significantlyincreasingtheviscosityofthebloodandthepotentialfortransmissionofblood-borne pathogens if the Blood was collected from another individual. WiththedevelopmentofsyntheticEPOinthe1980s, itbecamepossibletoprovideadditionalRBCsbyartificially stimulatingRBCproductioninthebonemarrow. Originallydevelopedtotreatpatientssufferingfromanemia, renal failure, orcancertreatment, largequantitiesofEPOcanbegeneratedbyrecombinantDNAtechnology. SyntheticEPO is injected under the skin and can increase hematocrit for many weeks. It may also induce polycythemia and raise hematocrit to 70 or greater. This increased viscosity raises the resistance of the Blood and forces the Heart to pump morepowerfully; in extremecases, ithas resultedin death. Other drugs such as cobaltII chloridehavebeenshown to increase natural erythropoietin gene expression. Blood doping has become problematic in many sports, especially cycling. Lance Armstrong, winner of seven Tour de France and many other cycling titles, was stripped of his victories and admitted to Blood doping in 2013.

In the past, when a bone marrow sample or transplant was necessary, the procedure would have required inserting a large-bore needle into the region near the iliac crest of the pelvic bones (os coxae). This location was preferred, since its location close to the body surface makes it more accessible, and it is relatively isolated from most vital organs. Unfortunately, the procedure is quite painful. Now, direct sampling of bone marrow can often be avoided. In many cases, stem cells can be isolated in just a few hoursfromasampleofapatientsblood.",

During the first day or two that it is in the circulation, an immatureerythrocyte, known as a reticulocyte, will still typicallycontain remnantsoforganelles. Reticulocytesshouldcompriseapproximately12percentoftheerythrocytecountandprovidea rough estimate of the rate of red blood cell production, with abnormally Low or High rates indicating deviations in the production of these cells.

Itconsistsoffourfoldedchainsofaproteincalledglobin, designated alpha 1 and 2, and beta 1 and 2 (Figure 18. 7a). Each of these globin molecules is bound to a red pigment 2 molecule calledheme, which contains an ion of iron (Fe ) (Figure 18. 7b). 748 CHAPTER 18 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Blood Figure18. 7Hemoglobin (a)Amoleculeofhemoglobincontainsfourglobinproteins, eachofwhichisboundtoone moleculeoftheiron-containingpigmentheme.

Anindividualerythrocytemaycontainabout300millionhemoglobinmolecules, andthereforecanbind to and transport up to 1. 2 billion oxygen molecules (seeFigure 18. 7b).

Thedeviceworksbysendingtwodifferentwavelengthsoflight(one red, the other infrared) through the finger and measuring the light with a photodetector as it exits.

Lifecycle of Erythrocytes Production of erythrocytes in the marrow occurs at the staggering rate of more than 2 million cells per second. For this productiontooccur, anumberofrawmaterialsmustbepresentinadequateamounts. Theseincludethesamenutrientsthat areessentialtotheproductionandmaintenanceofanycell, suchasglucose, lipids, andaminoacids. However, erythrocyte production also requires several trace elements: Iron. We have said that each heme group in a hemoglobin molecule contains an ion of the trace mineral iron. On average, lessthan20percentoftheironweconsumeisabsorbed. Hemeiron, fromanimalfoodssuchasmeat, poultry, and Fish, is absorbed more efficiently than non-heme iron from plant foods. Upon absorption, iron becomes part of the bodys total iron pool. The bone marrow, Liver, and spleen can store iron in the Protein compounds ferritin and hemosiderin. Ferroportin transports the iron across the intestinal cell plasma membranes and from its storage sites intotissuefluidwhereitenterstheblood. WhenEPOstimulatestheproductionoferythrocytes, ironisreleasedfrom storage, bound to transferrin, and carried to the red marrow where it attaches to erythrocyte precursors. Copper.

The erythrocyte lifecycle is summarized inFigure 18. 8. 750 CHAPTER 18 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Blood Figure 18. 8 Erythrocyte Lifecycle Erythrocytes are produced in the bone marrow and sent into the circulation. At the end of their lifecycle, they are destroyed by macrophages, and their components are recycled. Disorders of Erythrocytes The size, shape, and number of erythrocytes, and the number of hemoglobin molecules can have a major impact on a personshealth. WhenthenumberofRBCsorhemoglobinisdeficient, thegeneralconditioniscalledanemia. Thereare more than 400 types of anemia and more than 3. 5 million Americans suffer from this condition. Anemia can be broken down into three major groups: those caused by Blood loss, those caused by faulty or decreased red blood cell production, and those caused by excessive destruction of RBCs. Clinicians often use two groupings in diagnosis: The kinetic approach focusesonevaluatingtheproduction, destruction, andremovalofRBCs, whereasthemorphologicalapproachexaminesthe This content is available for free at or at CHAPTER 18 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Blood 751 RBCsthemselves, payingparticularemphasistotheirsize.

Excessive menstruation and loss of Blood during childbirth are also potential causes. AnemiascausedbyfaultyordecreasedRBCproductionincludesicklecellanemia, irondeficiencyanemia, vitamin deficiency anemia, and diseases of the bone marrow and stem cells. A characteristic change in the shape of erythrocytes is seen in sickle cell disease (also referred to as sickle cell anemia). A genetic disorder, it is caused by production of an abnormal type of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S, whichdeliverslessoxygentotissuesandcauseserythrocytestoassumeasickle(orcrescent)shape, especiallyatlow oxygen concentrations (Figure 18. 9). These abnormally shaped cells can then become lodged in narrow capillaries because they are unable to fold in on themselves to squeeze through, blocking Blood flow to tissues and causing a varietyofseriousproblemsfrompainfuljointstodelayedgrowthandevenblindnessandcerebrovascularaccidents (strokes). Sickle cell anemia is a genetic condition particularly found in individuals of African descent. Figure18. 9SickleCells Sicklecellanemiaiscausedbyamutationinoneofthehemoglobingenes.

This condition can occur in individuals with a deficiency of iron in the diet and is especiallycommoninteensandchildrenaswellasinvegansandvegetarians. Additionally, irondeficiencyanemia may be caused by either an inability to absorb and transport iron or slow, chronic bleeding. Vitamin-deficient anemias generally involve insufficient vitamin B12 and folate. Megaloblastic anemia involves a deficiency of vitamin B12 and/or folate, and often involves diets deficient in theseessentialnutrients.

Characteristics of Leukocytes Although leukocytes and erythrocytes both originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, they are very different from each other in many significant ways. For instance, leukocytes are far less numerous than erythrocytes: Typicallythereareonly5000to10, 000perµL. Theyarealsolargerthanerythrocytesandaretheonlyformedelementsthat arecompletecells, possessinganucleusandorganelles. Andalthoughthereisjustonetypeoferythrocyte, therearemany typesofleukocytes. Mostofthesetypeshaveamuchshorterlifespanthanthatoferythrocytes, someasshortasafewhours or even a few minutes in the case of acute infection. One of the most distinctive characteristics of leukocytes is their movement. Whereas erythrocytes spend their days circulating within the Blood vessels, leukocytes routinely leave the bloodstream to perform their defensive functions in thebodystissues. Forleukocytes, thevascularnetworkissimplyahighwaytheytravelandsoonexittoreachtheirtrue destination. When they arrive, they are often given distinct names, such as macrophage or microglia, depending on their function. AsshowninFigure18. 10, theyleavethecapillariesthesmallestbloodvesselsorothersmallvesselsthrough a process known as emigration (from the Latin for removal) or diapedesis (dia- through; -pedan to leap) in which they squeeze through adjacent cells in a Blood vessel wall.

Some leukocytes, such as the eosinophil and neutrophil, are characterized as granular leukocytes. Theyreleasechemicalsfromtheirgranulesthatdestroypathogens; theyarealsocapableofphagocytosis. The monocyte, an agranular leukocyte, differentiates into a macrophage that then phagocytizes the pathogens. Classification of Leukocytes Whenscientistsfirstbegantoobservestainedbloodslides, itquicklybecameevidentthatleukocytescouldbedividedinto two groups, according to whether their cytoplasm contained highly visible granules: Granular leukocytes contain abundant granules within the cytoplasm. They include neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils (you can view their lineage from myeloid stem cells inFigure 18. 4). 754 CHAPTER 18 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Blood While granules are not totally lacking in agranular leukocytes, they are far fewer and less obvious. Agranular leukocytes include monocytes, which mature into macrophages that are phagocytic, and lymphocytes, which arise from the lymphoid stem cell line.

Olderneutrophilshaveincreasingnumbersoflobesandareoftenreferredtoas polymorphonuclear(anucleuswithmanyforms), orsimplypolys. Youngerandimmatureneutrophilsbegintodevelop lobes and are known as bands. Neutrophils are rapid responders to the site of infection and are efficient phagocytes with a preference for bacteria. Their granules include lysozyme, an enzyme capable of lysing, or breaking down, bacterial cell walls; oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide; and defensins, proteins that bind to and puncture bacterial and fungal plasma membranes, so that the cell contents leak out.

Thenucleusoftheeosinophilwilltypicallyhavetwotothree lobes and, if stained properly, the granules will have a distinct red to orange color.

Ingeneral, basophilsintensifytheinflammatoryresponse. Theysharethistraitwithmastcells. Inthepast, mastcells were considered to be basophils that left the circulation. However, this appears not to be the case, as the two cell types develop from different lineages. The granules of basophils release histamines, which contribute to inflammation, and heparin, which opposes Blood clotting. High counts of basophils areassociatedwith allergies, parasiticinfections, and hypothyroidism. Low counts are associated with pregnancy, stress, and hyperthyroidism.

This finding has led to the three size range classification. The three major groups of lymphocytes include natural killer cells, B cells, and T cells. Natural killer (NK) cells are capable of recognizing cells that do not express self proteins on their plasma membrane or that contain foreign or abnormal markers. These nonself cells include cancer cells, cells infected with a virus, and other cells with atypical surface proteins. Thus, they provide generalized, nonspecific immunity. The larger lymphocytes are typically NK cells. B cells and T cells, also called B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes, play prominent roles in defending the body against specific pathogens (disease-causing microorganisms) and are involved in specific immunity.

(b)Thesynthesisoffibrininbloodclotsinvolveseitheranintrinsicpathwayoranextrinsicpathway, bothofwhichlead to a common pathway. (credit a: Kevin MacKenzie) Clotting Factors Involved in Coagulation In the coagulation cascade, chemicals called clotting factors (or coagulation factors) prompt reactions that activate still more coagulation factors. The process is complex, but is initiated along two basic pathways: The extrinsic pathway, which normally is triggered by trauma. The intrinsic pathway, which begins in the bloodstream and is triggered by internal damage to the wall of the vessel. Bothofthesemergeintoathirdpathway, referredtoasthecommonpathway(seeFigure18. 14b). Allthreepathways 2 aredependentuponthe12knownclottingfactors, includingCa andvitaminK(Table18. 1).

Extrinsic Pathway The quicker responding and more direct extrinsic pathway (also known as the tissue factor pathway) begins when damage occurs to the surrounding tissues, such as in a traumatic injury. Upon contact with Blood plasma, the damaged 2 extravascularcells, whichareextrinsictothebloodstream, releasefactorIII(thromboplastin). Sequentially, calcium thenfactor VII(proconvertin), whichisactivatedbyfactorIII, areadded, forminganenzymecomplex. Thisenzymecomplexleads toactivationoffactorX(StuartProwerfactor), whichactivatesthecommonpathwaydiscussedbelow. Theeventsinthe extrinsic pathway are completed in a matter of seconds.

    "Within the body, factor XII is typically activated when it encounters negatively charged molecules, such as inorganic polymers and phosphate This content is available for free at or at CHAPTER 18 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Blood 761 producedearlierintheseriesofintrinsicpathwayreactions. FactorXIIsetsoffaseriesofreactionsthatinturnactivates factor XI (antihemolytic factor C or plasma thromboplastin antecedent) then factor IX (antihemolytic factor B or plasma thromboplasmin).

Finally, factorVIII(antihemolyticfactorA)fromtheplateletsandendothelialcellscombineswithfactorIX(antihemolyticfactor Borplasmathromboplasmin)toformanenzymecomplexthatactivatesfactorX(StuartProwerfactororthrombokinase), leading to the common pathway. The events in the intrinsic pathway are completed in a few minutes. Common Pathway Boththeintrinsicandextrinsicpathwaysleadtothecommonpathway, inwhichfibrinisproducedtosealoffthevessel. OncefactorXhasbeenactivatedbyeithertheintrinsicorextrinsicpathway, theenzymeprothrombinaseconvertsfactorII, theinactiveenzymeprothrombin, intotheactiveenzymethrombin. (Notethatiftheenzymethrombinwerenotnormally inaninactiveform, clotswouldformspontaneously, aconditionnotconsistentwithlife. )Then, thrombinconvertsfactorI, the insoluble fibrinogen, into the soluble fibrin Protein strands. Factor XIII then stabilizes the fibrin clot. Fibrinolysis The stabilized clot is acted upon by contractile proteins within the platelets. As these proteins contract, they pull on the fibrin threads, bringing the edges of the clot more tightly together, somewhat as we do when tightening loose shoelaces (seeFigure18. 14a). Thisprocessalsowringsoutoftheclotasmallamountoffluidcalledserum, whichisbloodplasma without its clotting factors. To restore normal Blood flow as the vessel heals, the clot must eventually be removed. Fibrinolysis is the gradual degradation of the clot. Again, there is a fairly complicated series of reactions that involves factor XII and Proteincatabolizing enzymes. During this process, the inactive Protein plasminogen is converted into the active plasmin, which graduallybreaksdownthefibrinoftheclot. Additionally, bradykinin, avasodilator, isreleased, reversingtheeffectsofthe serotoninandprostaglandinsfromtheplatelets. Thisallowsthesmoothmuscleinthewallsofthevesselstorelaxandhelps to restore the circulation. Plasma Anticoagulants An anticoagulant is any substance that opposes coagulation. Several circulating plasma anticoagulants play a role in limitingthecoagulationprocesstotheregionofinjuryandrestoringanormal, clot-freeconditionofblood. Forinstance, a cluster of proteins collectively referred to as the Protein C system inactivates clotting factors involved in the intrinsic pathway. TFPI(tissuefactorpathwayinhibitor)inhibitstheconversionoftheinactivefactorVIItotheactiveforminthe extrinsic pathway. Antithrombin inactivates factor X and opposes the conversion of prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin in the common pathway. And as noted earlier, basophils release heparin, a short-acting anticoagulant that also opposes prothrombin. Heparinisalsofoundonthesurfacesofcellsliningthebloodvessels. Apharmaceuticalformofheparinis often administered therapeutically, for example, in surgical patients at risk for Blood clots.

The coagulation cascade restores hemostasis by activating coagulationfactorsinthepresenceofaninjury. Howdoestheendotheliumofthebloodvesselwallspreventtheblood from coagulating as it flows through the Blood vessels? Disorders of Clotting Either an insufficient or an excessive production of platelets can lead to severe disease or death. As discussed earlier, an insufficientnumberofplatelets, calledthrombocytopenia, typicallyresultsintheinabilityofbloodtoformclots. Thiscan lead to excessive bleeding, even from minor wounds. Another reason for failure of the Blood to clot is the inadequate production of functional amounts of one or more clotting factors. This is the case in the genetic disorder hemophilia, which is actually a group of related disorders, the 762 CHAPTER 18 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Blood most common of which is hemophilia A, accounting for approximately 80 percent of cases. This disorder results in the inability to synthesize sufficient quantities of factor VIII. Hemophilia B is the second most common form, accounting for approximately 20 percent of cases. In this case, there is a deficiency of factor IX. Both of these defects are linked to the X chromosome and are typically passed from a healthy (carrier) mother to her male offspring, since males are XY. Femaleswouldneedtoinheritadefectivegenefromeachparenttomanifestthedisease, sincetheyareXX. Patientswith hemophilia bleed from even minor internal and external wounds, and leak Blood into joint spaces after exercise and into Urine and stool. Hemophilia C is a rare condition that is triggered by an autosomal (not sex) chromosome that renders factorXInonfunctional.

However, aspirincanalsoleadtoserioussideeffects, includingincreasing the risk of ulcers. A patient is well advised to consult a physician before beginning any aspirin regimen. A class of drugs collectively known as thrombolytic agents can help speed up the degradation of an abnormal clot. If a thrombolytic agent is administered to a patient within 3 hours following a thrombotic stroke, the patients prognosisimprovessignificantly. However, somestrokesarenotcausedbythrombi, butbyhemorrhage. Thus, thecause must be determined before treatment begins.

Until that point, physicians did not understand that death sometimesfollowedbloodtransfusions, whenthetypeofdonorbloodinfusedintothepatientwasincompatiblewiththe patientsownblood.

In this chapter, we will use the more common terms antigens and antibodies. Antigens are generally large proteins, but may include other classes of organic molecules, including carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids. Following an infusion of incompatible Blood, erythrocytes with foreign antigens appear in the bloodstreamandtriggeranimmuneresponse.

BecausethearmsoftheY-shapedantibodiesattachrandomlytomorethanonenonselferythrocytesurface, theyform clumps of erythrocytes. This process is calledagglutination. The clumps of erythrocytes block small Blood vessels throughout the body, depriving tissues of oxygen and nutrients.

More than 50 antigens have been identified on erythrocyte membranes, but the most significant in terms of their potential harm to patients are classified in two groups: the ABO Blood group and the Rh Blood group.

    "1An Overview of Blood Blood is a fluid connective tissue critical to the transportation of nutrients, gases, and wastes throughout the body; to defendthebodyagainstinfectionandotherthreats; andtothehomeostaticregulationofpH, temperature, andotherinternal conditions. Blood is composed of formed elementserythrocytes, leukocytes, and cell fragments called plateletsand a fluid extracellular matrix called plasma. More than 90 percent of plasma is Water. The remainder is mostly plasma 772 CHAPTER 18 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Blood proteinsmainlyalbumin, globulins, andfibrinogenandotherdissolvedsolutessuchasglucose, lipids, electrolytes, and dissolvedgases. Becauseoftheformedelementsandtheplasmaproteinsandothersolutes, bloodisstickyandmoreviscous than Water. It is also slightly alkaline, and its temperature is slightly higher than normal body temperature. 18. 2Production of the Formed Elements Throughtheprocessofhemopoiesis, theformedelementsofbloodarecontinuallyproduced, replacingtherelativelyshortlivederythrocytes, leukocytes, andplatelets. Hemopoiesisbeginsintheredbonemarrow, withhemopoieticstemcellsthat differentiateintomyeloidandlymphoidlineages. Myeloidstemcellsgiverisetomostoftheformedelements. Lymphoid stem cells give rise only to the various lymphocytes designated as B and T cells, and NK cells. Hemopoietic growth factors, including erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, colony-stimulating factors, and interleukins, promote the proliferation and differentiation of formed elements. 18. 3Erythrocytes The most abundant formed elements in Blood, erythrocytes are red, biconcave disks packed with an oxygen-carrying compoundcalledhemoglobin.

Plateletsarefragmentsof cells known as megakaryocytes that dwell within the bone marrow. While many platelets are stored in the spleen, others enter the circulation and are essential for hemostasis; they also produce several growth factors important for repair and healing. 18. 5Hemostasis Hemostasisisthephysiologicalprocessbywhichbleedingceases. Hemostasisinvolvesthreebasicsteps: vascularspasm, theformationofaplateletplug, andcoagulation, inwhichclottingfactorspromotetheformationofafibrinclot. Fibrinolysis is the process in which a clot is degraded in a healing vessel. Anticoagulants are substances that oppose coagulation. They are important in limiting the extent and duration of clotting. Inadequate clotting can result from too few platelets, or inadequate production of clotting factors, for instance, in the genetic disorder hemophilia. Excessive clotting, called thrombosis, canbecausedbyexcessivenumbersofplatelets.

In transfusion reactions, antibodies attach to antigens on the surfaces of erythrocytes and cause agglutination and hemolysis. ABO Blood group antigensaredesignatedAandB. PeoplewithtypeAbloodhaveAantigensontheirerythrocytes, whereasthosewithtype BbloodhaveBantigens. ThosewithABbloodhavebothAandBantigens, andthosewithtypeObloodhaveneitherA norBantigens.

People with Rh Blood do not have this antigen on their erythrocytes, whereas those who are Rh do. About 85 percent of Americans are Rh.

There are also many other national and regional Heart associations that offer the same service, depending upon the location. Shape and Size of the Heart The shape of the Heart is similar to a pinecone, rather broad at the superior surface and tapering to the apex (see Figure 19. 2).

Thatis, exerciseresultsintheaddition of Protein myofilaments that increase the size of the individual cells without increasing their numbers, a concept called hypertrophy. Heartsofathletescanpumpbloodmoreeffectivelyatlowerratesthanthoseofnonathletes. Enlargedhearts are not always a result of exercise; they can result from pathologies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The cause ofanabnormallyenlargedheartmuscleisunknown, buttheconditionisoftenundiagnosedandcancausesuddendeathin apparently otherwise healthy young people. Chambers and Circulation through the Heart Thehumanheartconsistsoffourchambers: Theleftsideandtherightsideeachhaveoneatriumandoneventricle. Each of the upper chambers, the right atrium (plural atria) and the left atrium, acts as a receiving chamber and contracts to pushbloodintothelowerchambers, therightventricleandtheleftventricle. Theventriclesserveastheprimarypumping chambers of the Heart, propelling Blood to the lungs or to the rest of the body. Therearetwodistinctbutlinkedcircuitsinthehumancirculationcalledthepulmonaryandsystemiccircuits. Although both circuits transport Blood and everything it carries, we can initially view the circuits from the point of view of gases. Thepulmonarycircuittransportsbloodtoandfromthelungs, whereitpicksupoxygenanddeliverscarbondioxidefor exhalation. Thesystemiccircuittransportsoxygenatedbloodtovirtuallyallofthetissuesofthebodyandreturnsrelatively deoxygenated Blood and carbon dioxide to the Heart to be sent back to the pulmonary circulation. Therightventriclepumpsdeoxygenatedbloodintothepulmonarytrunk, whichleadstowardthelungsandbifurcates into the left and right pulmonary arteries. These vessels in turn branch many times before reaching the pulmonary capillaries, wheregasexchangeoccurs: Carbondioxideexitsthebloodandoxygenenters. Thepulmonarytrunkarteries andtheirbranchesaretheonlyarteriesinthepost-natalbodythatcarryrelativelydeoxygenatedblood. Highlyoxygenated bloodreturningfromthepulmonarycapillariesinthelungspassesthroughaseriesofvesselsthatjointogethertoformthe pulmonaryveinstheonlypost-natalveinsinthebodythatcarryhighlyoxygenatedblood. Thepulmonaryveinsconduct Blood into the left atrium, which pumps the Blood into the left ventricle, which in turn pumps oxygenated Blood into the aorta and on to the many branches of the systemic circuit. Eventually, these vessels will lead to the systemic capillaries, where exchange with the tissue fluid and cells of the body occurs. In this case, oxygen and nutrients exit the systemic capillaries to be used by the cells in their metabolic processes, and carbon dioxide and waste products will enter the Blood. Thebloodexitingthesystemiccapillariesislowerinoxygenconcentrationthanwhenitentered. Thecapillarieswill ultimatelyunitetoformvenules, joiningtoformever-largerveins, eventuallyflowingintothetwomajorsystemicveins, the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava, which return Blood to the right atrium. The Blood in the superior and inferior venae cavae flows into the right atrium, which pumps Blood into the right ventricle. This process of Blood circulationcontinuesaslongastheindividualremainsalive. Understandingtheflowofbloodthroughthepulmonaryand systemic circuits is critical to all health professions (Figure 19. 4). 782 CHAPTER 19 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE Heart Figure19. 4DualSystemoftheHumanBloodCirculation Bloodflowsfromtherightatriumtotherightventricle, whereitispumpedintothepulmonarycircuit. Thebloodinthepulmonaryarterybranchesislowinoxygenbutrelatively highincarbondioxide. Gasexchangeoccursinthepulmonarycapillaries(oxygenintotheblood, carbondioxideout), and Blood High in oxygen and Low in carbon dioxide is returned to the left atrium. From here, Blood enters the left ventricle, whichpumpsitintothesystemiccircuit. Followingexchangeinthesystemiccapillaries(oxygenandnutrients out of the capillaries and carbon dioxide and wastes in), Blood returns to the right atrium and the cycle is repeated. Membranes, Surface Features, and Layers Our exploration of more in-depth Heart structures begins by examining the membrane that surrounds the Heart, the prominentsurfacefeaturesoftheheart, andthelayersthatformthewalloftheheart. Eachofthesecomponentsplaysits own unique role in terms of function.",
    "It is made of simple squamousepitheliumcalledendothelium, whichiscontinuouswiththeendothelialliningofthebloodvessels(seeFigure 19. 5). Once regarded as a simple lining layer, recent evidence indicates that the endothelium of the endocardium and the coronary capillaries may play active roles in regulating the contraction of the muscle within the myocardium. The endothelium may also regulate the growth patterns of the cardiac muscle cells throughout life, and the endothelins it secretescreateanenvironmentinthesurroundingtissuefluidsthatregulatesionicconcentrationsandstatesofcontractility. 786 CHAPTER 19 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE Heart Endothelins are potent vasoconstrictors and, in a normal individual, establish a homeostatic balance with other vasoconstrictors and vasodilators. Internal Structure of the Heart Recall that the Hearts contraction cycle follows a dual pattern of circulationthe pulmonary and systemic circuitsbecause of the pairs of chambers that pump Blood into the circulation. In order to develop a more precise understanding of cardiac function, it is first necessary to explore the internal anatomical structures in more detail. Septa of the Heart ThewordseptumisderivedfromtheLatinforsomethingthatencloses; inthiscase, aseptum(pluralsepta)refersto a wall or partition that divides the Heart into chambers.

This content is available for free at or at CHAPTER 19 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE Heart 787 Heart: Heart Defects One very common form of interatrial septum pathology is patent foramen ovale, which occurs when the septum primumdoesnotcloseatbirth, andthefossaovalisisunabletofuse. ThewordpatentisfromtheLatinrootpatensfor open. Itmaybebenignorasymptomatic, perhapsneverbeingdiagnosed, orinextremecases, itmayrequiresurgical repair to close the opening permanently. As much as 2025 percent of the general population may have a patent foramenovale, butfortunately, mosthavethebenign, asymptomaticversion. Patentforamenovaleisnormallydetected by auscultation of a Heart murmur (an abnormal Heart sound) and confirmed by imaging with an echocardiogram.

Treatmentinvolvessurgerytoresect(remove)the affected region or angioplasty to open the abnormally narrow passageway. Studies have shown that the earlier the surgery is performed, the better the chance of survival. A patent ductus arteriosus is a congenital condition in which the ductus arteriosus fails to close. The condition may range from severe to benign. Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close results in Blood flowing from the higher Hypertension aorta into the lower Hypertension pulmonary trunk. This additional fluid moving toward the lungs increases pulmonary Hypertension and makes respiration difficult. Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnea), tachycardia, enlarged Heart, a widened pulse Hypertension, and poor weight gain in infants.",
    "Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnea), tachycardia, enlarged Heart, a widened pulse Hypertension, and poor weight gain in infants.

In the case of severe septal defects, including both tetralogy of Fallot and patent foramen ovale, failure of the Heart to develop properly can lead to a condition commonly known as a blue baby. Regardless of normal skin pigmentation, individualswiththisconditionhaveaninsufficientsupplyofoxygenatedblood, whichleadstocyanosis, a blue or purple coloration of the skin, especially when active.

However, coronarycirculationisnotcontinuous; rather, itcycles, reachingapeakwhentheheartmuscleisrelaxedandnearlyceasing while it is contracting. Coronary Arteries Coronaryarteriessupplybloodtothemyocardiumandothercomponentsoftheheart. Thefirstportionoftheaortaafter it arises from the left ventricle gives rise to the coronary arteries. There are three dilations in the wall of the aorta just superiortotheaorticsemilunarvalve. Twoofthese, theleftposterioraorticsinusandanterioraorticsinus, giverisetothe left and right coronary arteries, respectively. The third sinus, the right posterior aortic sinus, typically does not give rise to a vessel. Coronary vessel branches that remain on the surface of the artery and follow the sulci are called epicardial coronary arteries. The left coronary artery distributes Blood to the left side of the Heart, the left atrium and ventricle, and the interventricular septum. The circumflex artery arises from the left coronary artery and follows the coronary sulcus to theleft. Eventually, itwillfusewiththesmallbranchesoftherightcoronaryartery.

MIs may be triggered by excessive exercise, in which the partially occluded artery is no longer able to pump sufficient quantities of Blood, or severe stress, which may induce spasm of the smooth muscle in the walls of the vessel. InthecaseofacuteMI, thereisoftensuddenpainbeneaththesternum(retrosternalpain)calledanginapectoris, often radiating down the left arm in males but not in female patients. Until this anomaly between the sexes was discovered, many female patients suffering MIs were misdiagnosed and sent home. In addition, patients typically present with difficulty breathing and shortness of breath (dyspnea), irregular heartbeat (palpations), nausea and Vomiting, sweating(diaphoresis), anxiety, andfainting(syncope), althoughnotallofthesesymptomsmaybepresent. Manyofthesymptomsaresharedwithothermedicalconditions, includinganxietyattacksandsimpleindigestion, so differential diagnosis is critical. It is estimated that between 22 and 64 percent of MIs present without any symptoms. An myocardial infarction can be confirmed by examining the patients ECG, which frequently reveals alterations in the ST and Qcomponents. SomeclassificationschemesofMIarereferredtoasST-elevatedMI(STEMI)andnon-elevatedMI (non-STEMI). In addition, echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may be employed. Common bloodtestsindicatinganMIincludeelevatedlevelsofcreatinekinaseMB(anenzymethatcatalyzestheconversion ofcreatinetophosphocreatine, consumingATP)andcardiactroponin(theregulatoryproteinformusclecontraction), both of which are released by damaged cardiac muscle cells.

MIs may trigger cardiac arrest, but the two are not synonymous. Important risk factors for myocardial infarction include cardiovasculardisease, age, smoking, highbloodlevelsofthelow-densitylipoprotein(LDL, oftenreferredtoasBad cholesterol), Low levels of High-density lipoprotein (HDL, or Good cholesterol), hypertension, Diabetes mellitus, obesity, lack of physical exercise, chronic Kidney disease, excessive alcohol consumption, and use of illegal drugs.",
    "Coronary Veins Coronary veins drain the Heart and generally parallel the large surface arteries (see Figure 19. 15). The great cardiac vein can be seen initially on the surface of the Heart following the interventricular sulcus, but it eventually flows along the coronary sulcus into the coronary sinus on the posterior surface. The great cardiac vein initiallyparallels the anterior interventriculararteryanddrainstheareassuppliedbythisvessel.

Therearetwomajortypesofcardiacmusclecells: myocardialcontractilecellsandmyocardialconductingcells. The myocardialcontractilecellsconstitutethebulk(99percent)ofthecellsintheatriaandventricles. Contractilecellsconduct impulses and are responsible for contractions that pump Blood through the body. The myocardial conducting cells (1 percent of the cells) form the conduction system of the Heart. Except for Purkinje cells, they are generally much smaller than the contractile cells and have few of the myofibrils or filaments needed for contraction. Their function is similar in manyrespectstoneurons, althoughtheyarespecializedmusclecells. Myocardialconductioncellsinitiateandpropagatethe action potential (the electrical impulse) that travels throughout the Heart and triggers the contractions that propel the Blood.

Figure 19. 19 illustrates the initiation of the impulse in the SA node that then spreads the impulse throughout the atria to the atrioventricular node.

(3)Afterreachingtheatrioventricular node, there is a delay of approximately 100 ms that allows the atria to complete pumping Blood before the impulse is transmitted to the atrioventricular bundle. (4) Following the delay, the impulse travels through the atrioventricular bundleandbundlebranchestothePurkinjefibers, andalsoreachestherightpapillarymuscleviathemoderatorband. (5) The impulse spreads to the contractile fibers of the ventricle. (6) Ventricular contraction begins. The electrical event, the wave of depolarization, is the trigger for muscular contraction. The wave of depolarization begins in the right atrium, and the impulse spreads across the superior portions of both atria and then down through the contractilecells. Thecontractilecellsthenbegincontractionfromthesuperiortotheinferiorportionsoftheatria, efficiently pumping Blood into the ventricles. Atrioventricular (AV) Node The atrioventricular (AV) node is a second clump of specialized myocardial conductive cells, located in the inferior portionoftherightatriumwithintheatrioventricularseptum. Theseptumpreventstheimpulsefromspreadingdirectlyto theventricleswithoutpassingthroughtheAVnode. ThereisacriticalpausebeforetheAVnodedepolarizesandtransmits theimpulsetotheatrioventricularbundle(seeFigure19. 19, step3).

Damagedheartsorthosestimulatedbydrugscancontractathigherrates, butattheserates, the Heart can no longer effectively pump Blood. Atrioventricular Bundle (Bundle of His), Bundle Branches, and Purkinje Fibers Arising from the AV node, the atrioventricular bundle, or bundle of His, proceeds through the interventricular septum beforedividingintotwoatrioventricularbundlebranches, commonlycalledtheleftandrightbundlebranches. Theleft This content is available for free at or at CHAPTER 19 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE Heart 803 bundle branch has two fascicles. The left bundle branch supplies the left ventricle, and the right bundle branch the right ventricle. Since theleftventricleis muchlarger thanthe right, the leftbundlebranch is also considerablylarger thanthe right. Portionsoftherightbundlebrancharefoundinthemoderatorbandandsupplytherightpapillarymuscles. Because of this connection, each papillary muscle receives the impulse at approximately the same time, so they begin to contract simultaneously just prior to the remainder of the myocardial contractile cells of the ventricles. This is believed to allow tensiontodeveloponthechordaetendineaepriortorightventricularcontraction. Thereisnocorrespondingmoderatorband ontheleft. BothbundlebranchesdescendandreachtheapexoftheheartwheretheyconnectwiththePurkinjefibers(see Figure 19. 19, step 4). This passage takes approximately 25 ms. ThePurkinjefibersareadditionalmyocardialconductivefibersthatspreadtheimpulsetothemyocardialcontractile cellsintheventricles.

Inthiscase, thereisarapiddepolarization, followed by a plateau phase and then repolarization. This phenomenon accounts for the long refractory periods required for the cardiac muscle cells to pump Blood effectively before they are capable of firing for a second time. These cardiac myocytesnormallydonotinitiatetheirownelectricalpotential, althoughtheyarecapableofdoingso, butratherwaitfor an impulse to reach them. Contractile cells demonstrate a much more stable resting phase than conductive cells at approximately 80 mV for cellsintheatriaand90mVforcellsintheventricles. Despitethisinitialdifference, theothercomponentsoftheiraction potentials are virtually identical. In both cases, when stimulated by an action potential, voltage-gated channels rapidly open, beginningthepositive-feedbackmechanismofdepolarization. Thisrapidinfluxofpositivelychargedionsraisesthe membranepotentialtoapproximately30mV, atwhichpointthesodiumchannelsclose. Therapiddepolarizationperiod typically lasts 35 ms. Depolarization is followed by the plateau phase, in which membrane potential declines relatively 2 2 slowly. This is due in large part to the opening of the slow calcium channels, allowing calcium to enter the cell while few potassium 804 CHAPTER 19 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE Heart channels are open, allowing potassium to exit the cell.",
    "The relatively long plateau phase lasts approximately 175 ms. Once the 2 membrane potential reaches approximately zero, the calcium channels close and potassium channels open, allowing potassium to exit the cell. Therepolarizationlastsapproximately75ms. Atthispoint, membranepotentialdropsuntilitreachesrestinglevels once more and the cycle repeats. The entire event lasts between 250 and 300 ms (Figure 19. 21).

Thisextendedperiodiscritical, sincetheheartmusclemustcontract to pump Blood effectively and the contraction must follow the electrical events. Without extended refractory periods, premature contractions would occur in the Heart and would not be compatible with life. Figure 19. 21 Action Potential in Cardiac Contractile Cells (a) Note the long plateau phase due to the influx of calciumions. Theextendedrefractoryperiodallowsthecelltofullycontractbeforeanotherelectricaleventcanoccur. (b) The action potential for Heart muscle is compared to that of skeletal muscle. Calcium Ions Calcium ions play two critical roles in the physiology of cardiac muscle. Their influx through slow calcium channels accounts for the prolonged plateau phase and absolute refractory period that enable cardiac muscle to function properly. Calcium ions also combine with the regulatory Protein troponin in the troponin-tropomyosin complex; this complex removes the inhibition that prevents the heads of the myosin molecules from forming cross bridges with the active sites on actin that provide the power stroke of contraction. This mechanism is virtually identical to that of skeletal muscle. 2 Approximately20percentofthecalciumrequiredforcontractionissuppliedbytheinfluxofCa duringtheplateauphase. 2 The remaining calcium for contraction is released from storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Comparative Rates of Conduction System Firing The pattern of prepotential or spontaneous depolarization, followed by rapid depolarization and repolarization just described, are seen in the SA node and a few other conductive cells in the Heart.

TheSAnode, withoutnervousorendocrinecontrol, wouldinitiateaheartimpulseapproximately 80100 times per minute. Although each component of the conduction system is capable of generating its own impulse, the rate progressively slows as you proceed from the SA node to the Purkinje fibers.

Eachcomponent, segment, andintervalislabeledandcorresponds to important electrical events, demonstrating the relationship between these events and contraction in the Heart.

(b)Defibrillatorpaddlesaremorecommonlyused in hospital settings. (credit b: widerider107/flickr. com) A Heart block refers to an interruption in the normal conduction pathway. The nomenclature for these is very straightforward. SAnodalblocksoccurwithintheSAnode. AVnodalblocksoccurwithintheAVnode. Infra-Hisianblocks involve the bundle of His. Bundle branch blocks occur within either the left or right atrioventricular bundle branches. Hemiblocks are partial and occur within one or more fascicles of the atrioventricular bundle branch. Clinically, the most common types are the AV nodal and infra-Hisian blocks. AVblocksareoftendescribedbydegrees. Afirst-degreeorpartialblockindicatesadelayinconductionbetweenthe SAandAVnodes. ThiscanberecognizedontheECGasanabnormallylongPRinterval. Asecond-degreeorincomplete blockoccurswhensomeimpulsesfromtheSAnodereachtheAVnodeandcontinue, whileothersdonot. Inthisinstance, the ECG would reveal some P waves not followed by a QRS complex, while others would appear normal. In the thirddegree or complete block, there is no correlation between atrial activity (the P wave) and ventricular activity (the QRS complex). Even in the event of a total SA block, the AV node will assume the role of pacemaker and continue initiating contractions at 4060 contractions per minute, which is adequate to maintain consciousness. Secondand third-degree blocks are demonstrated on the ECG presented inFigure 19. 25. When arrhythmias become a chronic problem, the Heart maintains a junctional rhythm, which originates in the AV node. In order to speed up the Heart rate and restore full sinus rhythm, a cardiologist can implant an artificial pacemaker, whichdeliverselectricalimpulsestotheheartmuscletoensurethattheheartcontinuestocontractandpump Blood effectively. These artificial pacemakers are programmable by the cardiologists and can either provide stimulation temporarily upon demand or on a continuous basis. Some devices also contain built-in defibrillators. Cardiac Muscle Metabolism Normally, cardiac muscle metabolism is entirely aerobic. Oxygen from the lungs is brought to the Heart, and every other organ, attached to the hemoglobin molecules within the erythrocytes. Heart cells also store appreciable amounts of oxygeninmyoglobin. Normally, thesetwomechanisms, circulatingoxygenandoxygenattachedtomyoglobin, cansupply sufficient oxygen to the Heart, even during peak performance. 812 CHAPTER 19 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE Heart Fattyacidsandglucosefromthecirculationarebrokendownwithinthemitochondriatoreleaseenergyintheformof ATP.

The period of contraction that the Heart undergoes while it pumps Blood into circulation is called systole. Theperiodofrelaxationthatoccursasthechambersfillwithbloodiscalleddiastole.

Asbloodflowsintotheatria, thepressurewill rise, so the Blood will initially move passively from the atria into the ventricles.

Again, as you consider this flow and relate it to the conduction pathway, the elegance of the system should become apparent. Phases of the Cardiac Cycle At the beginning of the cardiac cycle, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed (diastole). Blood is flowing into the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and the coronary sinus.",
    "Blood is flowing into the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and the coronary sinus. Blood flows into the left atrium from the four pulmonaryveins. Thetwoatrioventricularvalves, thetricuspidandmitralvalves, arebothopen, sobloodflowsunimpeded fromtheatriaandintotheventricles. Approximately7080percentofventricularfillingoccursbythismethod. Thetwo semilunarvalves, thepulmonaryandaorticvalves, areclosed, preventingbackflowofbloodintotherightandleftventricles from the pulmonary trunk on the right and the aorta on the left. Atrial Systole and Diastole Contractionoftheatriafollowsdepolarization, representedbythePwaveoftheECG. Astheatrialmusclescontractfrom the superior portion of the atria toward the atrioventricular septum, Hypertension rises within the atria and Blood is pumped intotheventriclesthroughtheopenatrioventricular(tricuspid, andmitralorbicuspid)valves. Atthestartofatrialsystole, theventriclesarenormallyfilledwithapproximately7080percentoftheircapacityduetoinflowduringdiastole. Atrial contraction, alsoreferredtoastheatrialkick, contributestheremaining2030percentoffilling(seeFigure19. 27). Atrial systole lasts approximately 100 ms and ends prior to ventricular systole, as the atrial muscle returns to diastole. Ventricular Systole Ventricularsystole(seeFigure19. 27)followsthedepolarizationoftheventriclesandisrepresentedbytheQRScomplex intheECG. Itmaybeconvenientlydividedintotwophases, lastingatotalof270ms. Attheendofatrialsystoleandjust priortoatrialcontraction, theventriclescontainapproximately130mLbloodinarestingadultinastandingposition. This volume is known as theend diastolic volume (EDV)orpreload. Initially, asthemusclesintheventriclecontract, thepressureofthebloodwithinthechamberrises, butitisnotyet highenoughtoopenthesemilunar(pulmonaryandaortic)valvesandbeejectedfromtheheart. However, bloodpressure quicklyrisesabovethatoftheatriathatarenowrelaxedandindiastole. Thisincreaseinpressurecausesbloodtoflowback towardtheatria, closingthetricuspidandmitralvalves. Sincebloodisnotbeingejectedfromtheventriclesatthisearly stage, thevolumeofbloodwithinthechamberremainsconstant. Consequently, thisinitialphaseofventricularsystoleis known asisovolumic contraction, also called isovolumetric contraction (seeFigure 19. 27). Inthesecondphaseofventricularsystole, theventricularejectionphase, thecontractionoftheventricularmuscle hasraisedthepressurewithintheventricletothepointthatitisgreaterthanthepressuresinthepulmonarytrunkandthe aorta. Bloodispumpedfromtheheart, pushingopenthepulmonaryandaorticsemilunarvalves. Pressuregeneratedbythe leftventriclewillbeappreciablygreaterthanthepressuregeneratedbytherightventricle, sincetheexistingpressureinthe aortawillbesomuchhigher. Nevertheless, bothventriclespumpthesameamountofblood. Thisquantityisreferredtoas stroke volume. Stroke volume will normally be in the range of 7080 mL. Since ventricular systole began with an EDV ofapproximately130mLofblood, thismeansthatthereisstill5060mLofbloodremainingintheventriclefollowing contraction. This volume of Blood is known as theend systolic volume (ESV). Ventricular Diastole Ventricularrelaxation, ordiastole, followsrepolarizationoftheventriclesandisrepresentedbytheTwaveoftheECG. It too is divided into two distinct phases and lasts approximately 430 ms. Duringtheearlyphaseofventriculardiastole, astheventricularmusclerelaxes, pressureontheremainingbloodwithin theventriclebeginstofall. Whenpressurewithintheventriclesdropsbelowpressureinboththepulmonarytrunkandaorta, bloodflowsbacktowardtheheart, producingthedicroticnotch(smalldip)seeninbloodpressuretracings. Thesemilunar valves close to prevent backflow into the Heart. Since the atrioventricular valves remain closed at this point, there is no changeinthevolumeofbloodintheventricle, sotheearlyphaseofventriculardiastoleiscalledtheisovolumicventricular relaxation phase, also called isovolumetric ventricular relaxation phase (seeFigure 19. 27). Inthesecondphaseofventriculardiastole, calledlateventriculardiastole, astheventricularmusclerelaxes, Hypertension onthebloodwithintheventriclesdropsevenfurther. Eventually, itdropsbelowthepressureintheatria. Whenthisoccurs, bloodflows fromtheatriaintotheventricles, pushing openthetricuspidandmitralvalves. As Hypertension drops withinthe ventricles, bloodflowsfromthemajorveinsintotherelaxedatriaandfromthereintotheventricles. Bothchambersarein diastole, theatrioventricularvalvesareopen, andthesemilunarvalvesremainclosed(seeFigure19. 27). Thecardiaccycle is complete. Figure 19. 28illustrates the relationship between the cardiac cycle and the ECG. 814 CHAPTER 19 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE Heart Figure19. 28RelationshipbetweentheCardiacCycleandECG Initially, boththeatriaandventriclesarerelaxed (diastole). ThePwaverepresentsdepolarizationoftheatriaandisfollowedbyatrialcontraction(systole). Atrialsystole extends until the QRS complex, at which point, the atria relax. The QRS complex represents depolarization of the ventricles and is followed by ventricular contraction. The T wave represents the repolarization of the ventricles and marks the beginning of ventricular relaxation.

Tocalculatethis value, multiplystrokevolume(SV), theamountofbloodpumpedbyeachventricle, byheartrate(heart rate), incontractions per minute (or beats per minute, bpm). It can be represented mathematically by the following equation: CO heart rate SV SVisnormallymeasuredusinganechocardiogramtorecordEDVandESV, andcalculatingthedifference: SVEDV ESV. SV can also be measured using a specialized catheter, but this is an invasive procedure and far more dangerous to the patient. A mean SV for a resting 70-kg (150-lb) individual would be approximately 70 mL. There are several importantvariables, includingsizeoftheheart, physicalandmentalconditionoftheindividual, sex, contractility, duration ofcontraction, preloadorEDV, andafterloadorresistance.

Exercise and Maximum Cardiac Output Inhealthyyoungindividuals, HRmayincreaseto150bpmduringexercise. SVcanalsoincreasefrom70toapproximately 130mLduetoincreasedstrengthofcontraction. ThiswouldincreaseCOtoapproximately19. 5L/min, 45timestheresting rate. Topcardiovascularathletescanachieveevenhigherlevels. Attheirpeakperformance, theymayincreaserestingCO by 78 times. Sincetheheartisamuscle, exercisingitincreasesitsefficiency. ThedifferencebetweenmaximumandrestingCOis known as thecardiac reserve. It measures the residual capacity of the Heart to pump Blood. Heart Rates HRsvaryconsiderably, notonlywithexerciseandfitnesslevels, butalsowithage. NewbornrestingHRsmaybe120bpm. heart rate gradually decreases until young adulthood and then gradually increases again with age. MaximumHRsarenormallyintherangeof200220bpm, althoughtherearesomeextremecasesinwhichtheymay reach higher levels. As one ages, the ability to generate maximum rates decreases. This may be estimated by taking the maximal value of 220 bpm and subtracting the individuals age. So a 40-year-old individual would be expected to hit a maximum rate of approximately 180, and a 60-year-old person would achieve a heart rate of 160. 818 CHAPTER 19 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE Heart Heart: Abnormal Heart Rates For an adult, normal resting heart rate will be in the range of 60100 bpm. Bradycardia is the condition in which resting ratedropsbelow60bpm, andtachycardiaistheconditioninwhichtherestingrateisabove100bpm. Trainedathletes typically have very Low HRs. If the patient is not exhibiting other symptoms, such as weakness, Fatigue, dizziness, fainting, chest discomfort, palpitations, or respiratory distress, bradycardia is not considered clinically significant. However, ifanyofthesesymptomsarepresent, theymayindicatethattheheartisnotprovidingsufficientoxygenated bloodtothetissues. ThetermrelativebradycardiamaybeusedwithapatientwhohasaHRinthenormalrangebutis still suffering from these symptoms. Most patients remain asymptomatic as long as the heart rate remains above 50 bpm. Bradycardia may be caused by either inherent factors or causes external to the Heart. While the condition may beinherited, typicallyitisacquiredinolderindividuals. InherentcausesincludeabnormalitiesineithertheSAorAV node. If the condition is serious, a pacemaker may be required. Other causes include ischemia to the Heart muscle or diseases of the Heart vessels or valves. External causes include metabolic disorders, pathologies of the endocrine systemofteninvolvingthethyroid, electrolyteimbalances, neurologicaldisordersincludinginappropriateautonomic responses, autoimmunepathologies, over-prescriptionofbetablockerdrugsthatreduceHR, recreationaldruguse, or evenprolongedbedrest. Treatmentreliesuponestablishingtheunderlyingcauseofthedisorderandmaynecessitate supplemental oxygen. Tachycardiaisnotnormalinarestingpatientbutmaybedetectedinpregnantwomenorindividualsexperiencing extreme stress. In the latter case, it would likely be triggered by stimulation from the limbic system or disorders of theautonomicnervoussystem. Insomecases, tachycardiamayinvolveonlytheatria.",
    "Insomecases, tachycardiamayinvolveonlytheatria. Someindividualsmayremain asymptomatic, butwhenpresent, symptomsmayincludedizziness, shortnessofbreath, lightheadedness, rapidpulse, Heart palpations, chest Pain, or fainting (syncope). While tachycardia is defined as a heart rate above 100 bpm, there is considerable variation among people. Further, the normal resting HRs of children are often above 100 bpm, but this is not considered to be tachycardia Many causes of tachycardia may be benign, but the condition may also be correlatedwithfever, anemia, hypoxia, hyperthyroidism, hypersecretionofcatecholamines, somecardiomyopathies, some disorders of the valves, and acute exposure to radiation. Elevated rates in an exercising or resting patient are normalandexpected. Restingrateshouldalwaysbetakenafterrecoveryfromexercise. Treatmentdependsuponthe underlying cause but may include medications, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, ablation, or surgery. Correlation Between Heart Rates and Cardiac Output Initially, physiologicalconditionsthatcauseHRtoincreasealsotriggeranincreaseinSV. Duringexercise, therateofblood returning to the Heart increases. However as the heart rate rises, there is less time spent in diastole and consequently less time fortheventriclestofillwithblood. Eventhoughthereislessfillingtime, SVwillinitiallyremainhigh. However, asHR continuestoincrease, SVgraduallydecreasesduetodecreasedfillingtime. COwillinitiallystabilizeastheincreasingHR compensatesforthedecreasingSV, butatveryhighrates, COwilleventuallydecreaseasincreasingratesarenolongerable tocompensateforthedecreasingSV. Considerthisphenomenoninahealthyyoungindividual. Initially, asHRincreases fromrestingtoapproximately120bpm, COwillrise. AsHRincreasesfrom120to160bpm, COremainsstable, sincethe increaseinrateisoffsetbydecreasingventricularfillingtimeand, consequently, SV.

ThetargetHRislooselydefinedastherangeinwhichboththeheartand lungs receive the maximum benefit from the aerobic workout and is dependent upon age. Cardiovascular Centers Nervous control over heart rate is centralized within the two paired cardiovascular centers of the medulla oblongata (Figure 19. 32). The cardioaccelerator regions stimulate activity via sympathetic stimulation of the cardioaccelerator nerves, and thecardioinhibitorycentersdecreaseheartactivityviaparasympatheticstimulationasonecomponentofthevagusnerve, cranialnerveX. Duringrest, bothcentersprovideslightstimulationtotheheart, contributingtoautonomictone. Thisis asimilarconcepttotoneinskeletalmuscles. Normally, vagalstimulationpredominatesas, leftunregulated, theSAnode would initiate a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulations flow through a paired complex network of nerve fibers known as the cardiac plexus near the base of the Heart. The cardioaccelerator center also sends additional fibers, forming the cardiacnervesviasympatheticganglia(thecervicalgangliaplussuperiorthoracicgangliaT1T4)toboththeSAandAV nodes, plus additional fibers to the atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers thanparasympatheticfibers.

Figure 19. 32 Autonomic Innervation of the Heart Cardioaccelerator and cardioinhibitory areas are components ofthepairedcardiaccenterslocatedinthemedullaoblongataofthebrain. Theyinnervatetheheartviasympathetic cardiac nerves that increase cardiac activity and vagus (parasympathetic) nerves that slow cardiac activity. Parasympathetic stimulation originates from the cardioinhibitory region with impulses traveling via the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X). The vagus nerve sends branches to both the SA and AV nodes, and to portions of both the atria and ventricles. Parasympathetic stimulation releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction. AChslowsHRbyopeningchemical-orligand-gatedpotassiumionchannelstoslowtherateofspontaneousdepolarization, whichextendsrepolarizationandincreasesthetimebeforethenextspontaneousdepolarizationoccurs.

Input to the Cardiovascular Center Thecardiovascularcenterreceivesinputfromaseriesofvisceralreceptorswithimpulsestravelingthroughvisceralsensory fiberswithinthevagusandsympatheticnervesviathecardiacplexus. Amongthesereceptorsarevariousproprioreceptors, baroreceptors, and chemoreceptors, plus stimuli from the limbic system. Collectively, these inputs normally enable the cardiovascularcenterstoregulateheartfunctionprecisely, aprocessknownascardiacreflexes. Increasedphysicalactivity results in increased rates of firing by various proprioreceptors located in muscles, joint capsules, and tendons. Any such increaseinphysicalactivitywouldlogicallywarrantincreasedbloodflow. Thecardiaccentersmonitortheseincreasedrates of firing, and suppress parasympathetic stimulation and increase sympathetic stimulation as needed in order to increase Blood flow. Similarly, baroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other locations, including pulmonary vessels and the right side of the Heart itself. Rates of firing from the baroreceptors represent Blood Hypertension, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of Blood.",
    "Rates of firing from the baroreceptors represent Blood Hypertension, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of Blood.

Withincreasedpressure andstretch, therateofbaroreceptorfiringincreases, andthecardiaccentersdecreasesympatheticstimulationandincrease parasympathetic stimulation.

CarefulstatisticalanalysisbytheCassBusinessSchool, aprestigiousinstitutionlocatedinLondon, published in 2008, revealed that within one year of the death of a loved one, women are more than twice as likely to die and males are six times as likely to die as would otherwise be expected. Other Factors Influencing Heart Rate Using a combination of autorhythmicity and innervation, the cardiovascular center is able to provide relatively precise controloverHR. However, thereareanumberofotherfactorsthathaveanimpactonHRaswell, includingepinephrine, NE, andthyroidhormones; levelsofvariousionsincludingcalcium, Potassium, andsodium; bodytemperature; hypoxia; andpHbalance(Table19. 1andTable19. 2). Afterreadingthissection, theimportanceofmaintaininghomeostasisshould become even more apparent. Major Factors Increasing Heart Rate and Force of Contraction Factor Effect Cardioaccelerator nerves Release of norepinephrine Proprioreceptors Increased rates of firing during exercise Chemoreceptors Decreased levels of O2; increased levels of H , CO2, and lactic acid Baroreceptors Decreased rates of firing, indicating falling Blood volume/Hypertension Limbic system Anticipation of physical exercise or strong emotions Catecholamines Increased epinephrine and norepinephrine Thyroid hormones Increased T3and T4 Calcium Increased calcium 2 Potassium Decreased potassium Sodium Decreased sodium Body temperature Increased body temperature Table 19. 1 822 CHAPTER 19 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE Heart Major Factors Increasing Heart Rate and Force of Contraction Factor Effect Nicotine and caffeine Stimulants, increasing Heart rate Table 19. 1 Factors Decreasing Heart Rate and Force of Contraction Factor Effect Cardioinhibitor nerves (vagus) Release of acetylcholine Proprioreceptors Decreased rates of firing following exercise Chemoreceptors Increased levels of O2; decreased levels of H and CO2 Baroreceptors Increased rates of firing, indicating higher Blood volume/Hypertension Limbic system Anticipation of relaxation Catecholamines Decreased epinephrine and norepinephrine Thyroid hormones Decreased T3and T4 Calcium Decreased calcium 2 Potassium Increased potassium Sodium Increased sodium Body temperature Decrease in body temperature Table 19. 2 Epinephrine and Norepinephrine Thecatecholamines, epinephrineandNE, secretedbytheadrenalmedullaformonecomponentoftheextendedfight-orflight mechanism. The other component is sympathetic stimulation. Epinephrine and NE have similar effects: binding to thebeta-1receptors, andopeningsodiumandcalciumionchemical-orligand-gatedchannels. Therateofdepolarization is increased by this additional influx of positively charged ions, so the threshold is reached more quickly and the period of repolarization is shortened. However, massive releases of these hormones coupled with sympathetic stimulation may actually lead to arrhythmias. There is no parasympathetic stimulation to the adrenal medulla. Thyroid Hormones Ingeneral, increasedlevelsofthyroidhormone, orthyroxin, increasecardiacrateandcontractility. Theimpactofthyroid hormoneistypicallyofamuchlongerdurationthanthatofthecatecholamines.

While legal and nonregulated, concerns about nicotines safety and documented links to respiratory and cardiac disease have resulted in warning labels on cigarette packages. Factors Decreasing Heart Rate heart rate can be slowed when a person experiences altered Sodium and Potassium levels, hypoxia, acidosis, alkalosis, and hypothermia(seeTable19. 1). TherelationshipbetweenelectrolytesandHRiscomplex, butmaintainingelectrolytebalance iscriticaltothenormalwaveofdepolarization. Ofthetwoions, potassiumhasthegreaterclinicalsignificance.

Severehyponatremialeadstobothbradycardiaand otherarrhythmias.

Heartmusclereliesexclusivelyonaerobicmetabolismforenergy. Hypoxia(aninsufficientsupplyofoxygen)leadsto decreasing HRs, since metabolic reactions fueling Heart contraction are restricted.

Recall that enzymes are the regulators or catalysts of virtually all biochemical reactions; they are sensitive to pH and will change shape slightly with values outside their normal range. These variations in pH and accompanying slight physical changes to the active site on the enzyme decrease the rate of formation of the enzyme-substrate complex, subsequentlydecreasingtherateofmanyenzymaticreactions, whichcanhavecomplexeffectsonHR. Severechangesin pH will lead to denaturation of the enzyme. The last variable is body temperature.

Stroke Volume Many of the same factors that regulate heart rate also impact cardiac function by altering SV. While a number of variables are involved, SVisultimatelydependentuponthedifferencebetweenEDVandESV. Thethreeprimaryfactorstoconsiderare preload, orthestretchontheventriclespriortocontraction; thecontractility, ortheforceorstrengthofthecontractionitself; andafterload, theforcetheventriclesmustgeneratetopumpbloodagainsttheresistanceinthevessels. Thesefactorsare summarized inTable 19. 1andTable 19. 2. Preload PreloadisanotherwayofexpressingEDV. Therefore, thegreatertheEDVis, thegreaterthepreloadis. Oneoftheprimary factorstoconsiderisfillingtime, orthedurationofventriculardiastoleduringwhichfillingoccurs. Themorerapidlythe Heart contracts, the shorter the filling time becomes, and the lower the EDV and preload are. This effect can be partially overcomebyincreasingthesecondvariable, contractility, andraisingSV, butovertime, theheartisunabletocompensate for decreased filling time, and preload also decreases. Withincreasingventricularfilling, bothEDVorpreloadincrease, andthecardiacmuscleitselfisstretchedtoagreater degree. Atrest, thereislittlestretchoftheventricularmuscle, andthesarcomeresremainshort. Withincreasedventricular filling, theventricularmuscleisincreasinglystretchedandthesarcomerelengthincreases. Asthesarcomeresreachtheir optimal lengths, they will contract more powerfully, because more of the myosin heads can bind to the actin on the thin filaments, formingcrossbridgesandincreasingthestrengthofcontractionandSV. Ifthisprocessweretocontinueandthe sarcomeresstretchedbeyondtheiroptimallengths, theforceofcontractionwoulddecrease. However, duetothephysical constraints of the location of the Heart, this excessive stretch is not a concern. The relationship between ventricular stretch and contraction has been stated in the well-known Frank-Starling mechanismorsimplyStarlingsLawoftheHeart. Thisprinciplestatesthat, withinphysiologicallimits, theforceofheart contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of the muscle fiber. This means that the greater the stretch of the ventricularmuscle(withinlimits), themorepowerfulthecontractionis, whichinturnincreasesSV. Therefore, byincreasing preload, you increase the second variable, contractility. Otto Frank (18651944) was a German physiologist; among his many published works are detailed studies of this importantheartrelationship. ErnestStarling(18661927)wasanimportantEnglishphysiologistwhoalsostudiedtheheart. 824 CHAPTER 19 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE Heart Althoughtheyworkedlargelyindependently, theircombinedeffortsandsimilarconclusionshavebeenrecognizedinthe name Frank-Starling mechanism. Any sympathetic stimulation to the venous system will increase venous return to the Heart, which contributes to ventricularfilling, andEDVandpreload. Whilemuchoftheventricularfillingoccurswhilebothatriaandventriclesarein diastole, thecontractionoftheatria, theatrialkick, playsacrucialrolebyprovidingthelast2030percentofventricular filling. Contractility It is virtually impossible to consider preload or ESV without including an early mention of the concept of contractility. Indeed, the two parameters are intimately linked. Contractility refers to the force of the contraction of the Heart muscle, whichcontrolsSV, andistheprimaryparameterforimpactingESV. Themoreforcefulthecontractionis, thegreatertheSV andsmallertheESVare. LessforcefulcontractionsresultinsmallerSVsandlargerESVs.

Factorsthatincreasecontractility aredescribedaspositiveinotropicfactors, andthosethatdecreasecontractilityaredescribedasnegativeinotropicfactors (ino- fiber; -tropic turning toward). Not surprisingly, sympathetic stimulation is a positive inotrope, whereas parasympathetic stimulation is a negative inotrope. Sympathetic stimulation triggers the release of NE at the neuromuscular junction from the cardiac nerves and alsostimulatestheadrenalcortextosecreteepinephrineandNE. InadditiontotheirstimulatoryeffectsonHR, theyalso bind to both alpha and beta receptors on the cardiac muscle cell membrane to increase metabolic rate and the force of contraction. This combination of actions has the net effect of increasing SV and leaving a smaller residual ESV in the ventricles. Incomparison, parasympatheticstimulationreleasesAChattheneuromuscularjunctionfromthevagusnerve. The membrane hyperpolarizes and inhibits contraction to decrease the strength of contraction and SV, and to raise ESV. Sinceparasympatheticfibersaremorewidespreadintheatriathanintheventricles, theprimarysiteofactionisintheupper chambers. ParasympatheticstimulationintheatriadecreasestheatrialkickandreducesEDV, whichdecreasesventricular stretchandpreload, therebyfurtherlimitingtheforceofventricularcontraction. Strongerparasympatheticstimulationalso directly decreases the force of contraction of the ventricles. Several synthetic drugs, including dopamine and isoproterenol, have been developed that mimic the effects of epinephrine and NE by stimulating the influx of calcium ions from the extracellular fluid. Higher concentrations of intracellular calcium ions increase the strength of contraction. Excess calcium (hypercalcemia) also acts as a positive inotropic agent. The drug digitalis lowers heart rate and increases the strength of the contraction, acting as a positive inotropic agent by blocking the sequestering of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This leads to higher intracellular calcium levels and greater strength of contraction. In addition to the catecholamines from the adrenal medulla, other hormones also demonstrate positive inotropic effects. These include thyroid hormones and glucagon from the pancreas. Negative inotropic agents include hypoxia, acidosis, hyperkalemia, and a variety of synthetic drugs. These include numerousbetablockersandcalciumchannelblockers. Earlybetablockerdrugsincludepropranololandpronethalol, and arecreditedwithrevolutionizingtreatmentofcardiacpatientsexperiencinganginapectoris. Thereisalsoalargeclassof dihydropyridine, phenylalkylamine, andbenzothiazepinecalciumchannelblockersthatmaybeadministereddecreasingthe strength of contraction and SV.

HRislargelydeterminedandregulated by autonomic stimulation and hormones. There are several feedback loops that contribute to maintaining homeostasis dependent upon activity levels, such as the atrial reflex, which is determined by venous return. 834 CHAPTER 19 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE Heart SV is regulated by autonomic innervation and hormones, but also by filling time and venous return. Venous return is determined by activity of the skeletal muscles, Blood volume, and changes in peripheral circulation. Venous return determinespreloadandtheatrialreflex.

    "Thisiscriticalbecausebloodflow becomes sluggish in the extremities, as a result of the lower Hypertension and the effects of gravity. The walls of arteries and veins are largely composed of living cells and their products (including collagenous and elastic fibers); the cells require nourishment and produce waste. Since Blood passes through the larger vessels relatively quickly, thereislimitedopportunityforbloodinthelumenofthevesseltoprovidenourishmenttoorremovewastefromthe vesselscells. Further, thewallsofthelargervesselsaretoothickfornutrientstodiffusethroughtoallofthecells. Larger arteries and veins contain small Blood vessels within their walls known as the vasa vasorumliterally vessels of the vesseltoprovidethemwiththiscriticalexchange. Sincethepressurewithinarteriesisrelativelyhigh, thevasavasorum mustfunctionintheouterlayersofthevessel(seeFigure20. 3)orthepressureexertedbythebloodpassingthroughthe vesselwouldcollapseit, preventinganyexchangefromoccurring. Thelowerpressurewithinveinsallowsthevasavasorum to be located closer to the lumen.

Damagetothisendothelialliningandexposureofblood tothecollagenousfibersbeneathisoneoftheprimarycausesofclotformation. Untilrecently, theendotheliumwasviewed simplyastheboundarybetweenthebloodinthelumenandthewallsofthevessels. Recentstudies, however, haveshown that it is physiologically critical to such activities as helping to regulate capillary exchange and altering Blood flow. The endotheliumreleaseslocalchemicalscalledendothelinsthatcanconstrictthesmoothmusclewithinthewallsofthevessel to increase Blood Hypertension. Uncompensated overproduction of endothelins may contribute to hypertension (High Blood Hypertension) and cardiovascular disease. Next to the endothelium is the basement membrane, or basal lamina, that effectively binds the endothelium to the connective tissue. The basement membrane provides strength while maintaining flexibility, and it is permeable, allowing materialstopassthroughit. Thethinouterlayerofthetunicaintimacontainsasmallamountofareolarconnectivetissue thatconsistsprimarilyofelasticfiberstoprovidethevesselwithadditionalflexibility; italsocontainssomecollagenous fibers to provide additional strength.

Ifthetunicaexternadid not hold the vessel in place, any movement would likely result in disruption of Blood flow. Arteries An artery is a Blood vessel that conducts Blood away from the Heart. All arteries have relatively thick walls that can withstand the High Hypertension of Blood ejected from the Heart. However, those close to the Heart have the thickest walls, containingahighpercentageofelasticfibersinallthreeoftheirtunics. Thistypeofarteryisknownasanelasticartery (Figure 20. 4). Vessels larger than 10 mm in diameter are typically elastic. Their abundant elastic fibers allow them to expand, asbloodpumpedfromtheventriclespassesthroughthem, andthentorecoilafterthesurgehaspassed. Ifartery wallswererigidandunabletoexpandandrecoil, theirresistancetobloodflowwouldgreatlyincreaseandbloodpressure would rise to even higher levels, which would in turn require the Heart to pump harder to increase the volume of Blood expelledbyeachpump(thestrokevolume)andmaintainadequatepressureandflow. Arterywallswouldhavetobecome even thicker in response to this increased Hypertension. The elastic recoil of the vascular wall helps to maintain the Hypertension gradientthatdrivesthebloodthroughthearterialsystem. Anelasticarteryisalsoknownasaconductingartery, becausethe large diameter of the lumen enables it to accept a large volume of Blood from the Heart and conduct it to smaller branches.

Thediameterofmusculararteriestypicallyrangesfrom0. 1mmto10mm. Theirthicktunicamedia allows muscular arteries to play a leading role in vasoconstriction. In contrast, their decreased quantity of elastic fibers limits their abilityto expand. Fortunately, because the Blood Hypertension has eased by the time it reaches these more distant vessels, elasticity has become less important. Notice that although the distinctions between elastic and muscular arteries are important, there is no line of demarcationwhereanelasticarterysuddenlybecomesmuscular. Rather, thereisagradualtransitionasthevasculartree repeatedlybranches. Inturn, musculararteriesbranchtodistributebloodtothevastnetworkofarterioles.

With a lumen averaging 30 micrometers or less in diameter, arterioles are critical in slowing downor resistingbloodflowand, thus, causingasubstantialdropinbloodpressure. Becauseofthis, youmayseethemreferred to as resistance vessels. The muscle fibers in arterioles are normally slightly contracted, causing arterioles to maintain a consistent muscle tonein this case referred to as vascular tonein a similar manner to the muscular tone of skeletal muscle.

Theprecisediameter ofthelumenofanarterioleatanygivenmomentisdeterminedbyneuralandchemicalcontrols, andvasoconstrictionand vasodilation in the arterioles are the primary mechanisms for distribution of Blood flow. Capillaries Acapillaryisamicroscopicchannelthatsuppliesbloodtothetissuesthemselves, aprocesscalledperfusion. Exchange of gases and other substances occurs in the capillaries between the Blood and the surrounding cells and their tissue fluid (interstitial fluid). The diameter of a capillary lumen ranges from 510 micrometers; the smallest are just barely wide enough for an erythrocyte to squeeze through. Flow through capillaries is often described asmicrocirculation. Thewallofacapillaryconsistsoftheendotheliallayersurroundedbyabasementmembranewithoccasionalsmooth musclefibers.

However, clinicaledemagoesbeyondnormalswellingandrequiresmedical treatment. Edemahasmanypotentialcauses, includinghypertensionandheartfailure, severeproteindeficiency, renal failure, andmanyothers. Inordertotreatedema, whichisasignratherthanadiscretedisorder, theunderlyingcause must be diagnosed and alleviated. Figure 20. 8Varicose VeinsVaricose veins are commonly found in the lower limbs. (credit: Thomas Kriese) Edemamaybeaccompaniedbyvaricoseveins, especiallyinthesuperficialveinsofthelegs(Figure20. 8). This disorderariseswhendefectivevalvesallowbloodtoaccumulatewithintheveins, causingthemtodistend, twist, and become visible on the surface of the integument. Varicose veins may occur in both sexes, but are more common in women and are often related to pregnancy. More than simple cosmetic blemishes, varicose veins are often painful and sometimes itchy or throbbing. Without treatment, they tend to grow worse over time. The use of support hose, as well as elevating the feet and legs whenever possible, may be helpful in alleviating this condition. Laser surgery andinterventionalradiologicprocedurescanreducethesizeandseverityofvaricoseveins. Severecasesmayrequire conventional surgery to remove the damaged vessels. As there are typically redundant circulation patterns, that is, anastomoses, for the smaller and more superficial veins, removal does not typically impair the circulation. There is evidence that patients with varicose veins suffer a greater risk of developing a thrombus or clot. 848 CHAPTER 20 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Blood VESSELS AND CIRCULATION Veins as Blood Reservoirs In addition to their primary function of returning Blood to the Heart, veins may be considered Blood reservoirs, since systemicveinscontainapproximately64percentofthebloodvolumeatanygiventime(Figure20. 9).

Mean is a statistical concept and is calculated by taking the sum of the values divided by the number of values. Although complicated to measure directly and complicated to calculate, MAP can be approximated by adding the diastolic Hypertension to one-third of the pulse Hypertension or systolic Hypertension minus the diastolic Hypertension: (systolic-diastolic blood pressure) MAP diastolic blood pressure 3 InFigure20. 10, thisvalueisapproximately80(12080)/3, or93. 33.

Measurement of Blood Hypertension Blood Hypertension is one of the critical parameters measured on virtually every patient in every healthcare setting. The techniqueused today was developed more than 100 years ago by a pioneering Russian physician, Dr. Nikolai Korotkoff. Turbulentbloodflowthroughthevesselscanbeheardasasofttickingwhilemeasuringbloodpressure; thesesoundsare known as Korotkoff sounds.",
    "Turbulentbloodflowthroughthevesselscanbeheardasasofttickingwhilemeasuringbloodpressure; thesesoundsare known as Korotkoff sounds. The technique of measuring Blood Hypertension requires the use of a sphygmomanometer (a Blood Hypertension cuff attached to a measuring device) and a stethoscope. The technique is as follows: The clinician wraps an inflatable cuff tightly around the patients arm at about the level of the Heart. The clinician squeezes a rubber pump to inject air into the cuff, raising Hypertension around the artery and temporarily cutting off Blood flow into the patients arm. The clinician places the stethoscope on the patients antecubital region and, while gradually allowing air within the cuff to escape, listens for the Korotkoff sounds. AlthoughtherearefiverecognizedKorotkoffsounds, onlytwoarenormallyrecorded. Initially, nosoundsareheard sincethereisnobloodflowthroughthevessels, butasairpressuredrops, thecuffrelaxes, andbloodflowreturnstothearm. As shown in Figure 20. 12, the first sound heard through the stethoscopethe first Korotkoff soundindicates systolic Hypertension. As more air is released from the cuff, Blood is able to flow freely through the brachial artery and all sounds disappear. The point at which the last sound is heard is recorded as the patients diastolic Hypertension.

Variables Affecting Blood Flow and Blood Hypertension Five variables influence Blood flow and Blood Hypertension: Cardiac output Compliance Volume of the Blood Viscosity of the Blood Blood vessel length and diameter Recallthatbloodmovesfromhigherpressuretolowerpressure. Itispumpedfromtheheartintothearteriesathigh Hypertension. If you increase Hypertension in the arteries (afterload), and cardiac function does not compensate, Blood flow will actuallydecrease. Inthevenoussystem, theoppositerelationshipistrue. Increasedpressureintheveinsdoesnotdecrease flowasitdoesinarteries, butactuallyincreasesflow. Sincepressureintheveinsisnormallyrelativelylow, forbloodto flow back into the Heart, the Hypertension in the atria during atrial diastole must be even lower. It normally approaches zero, except when the atria contract (seeFigure 20. 10). Cardiac Output Cardiac output is the measurement of Blood flow from the Heart through the ventricles, and is usually measured in liters perminute. Anyfactorthatcausescardiacoutputtoincrease, byelevatingheartrateorstrokevolumeorboth, willelevate bloodpressureandpromotebloodflow. Thesefactorsincludesympatheticstimulation, thecatecholaminesepinephrineand norepinephrine, thyroidhormones, andincreasedcalciumionlevels. Conversely, anyfactorthatdecreasescardiacoutput, by decreasing Heart rate or stroke volume or both, will decrease arterial Hypertension and Blood flow. These factors include parasympathetic stimulation, elevated or decreased Potassium ion levels, decreased calcium levels, anoxia, and acidosis. Compliance Compliance is the ability of any compartment to expand to accommodate increased content. A metal pipe, for example, is not compliant, whereas a balloon is. The greater the compliance of an artery, the more effectively it is able to expand to accommodate surges in Blood flow without increased resistance or Blood Hypertension. Veins are more compliant than arteriesandcanexpandtoholdmoreblood. Whenvasculardiseasecausesstiffeningofarteries, complianceisreducedand resistancetobloodflowisincreased. Theresultismoreturbulence, higherpressurewithinthevessel, andreducedblood flow. This increases the work of the Heart. A Mathematical Approach to Factors Affecting Blood Flow Jean Louis Marie Poiseuille was a French physician and physiologist who devised a mathematical equation describing bloodflowanditsrelationshiptoknownparameters. Thesameequationalsoappliestoengineeringstudiesoftheflowof fluids. Althoughunderstandingthemathbehindtherelationshipsamongthefactorsaffectingbloodflowisnotnecessaryto 854 CHAPTER 20 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Blood VESSELS AND CIRCULATION understandbloodflow, itcanhelpsolidifyanunderstandingoftheirrelationships. Pleasenotethateveniftheequationlooks intimidating, breaking it down into its components and following the relationships will make these relationships clearer, even if you are weak in math. Focus on the three critical variables: radius (r), vessel length (λ), and viscosity (η). Poiseuilles equation: π ΔP r4 Blood flow 8ηλ πistheGreekletterpi, usedtorepresentthemathematicalconstantthatistheratioofacirclescircumferencetoits diameter. It may commonly be represented as 3. 14, although the actual number extends to infinity. ΔP represents the difference in Hypertension. 4 r is the radius (one-half of the diameter) of the vessel to the fourth power.",
    "4 r is the radius (one-half of the diameter) of the vessel to the fourth power. η is the Greek letter eta and represents the viscosity of the Blood. λ is the Greek letter lambda and represents the length of a Blood vessel. One of several things this equation allows ultrasound to do is calculate the resistance in the vascular system. Normally this value is extremely difficult to measure, but it can be calculated from this known relationship: ΔP Blood flow Resistance If we rearrange this slightly, ΔP Resistance Blood flow Then by substituting Pouseilles equation for Blood flow: 8ηλ Resistance πr4 Byexaminingthisequation, youcanseethatthereareonlythreevariables: viscosity, vessellength, andradius, since 8 and π are both constants. The important thing to remember is this: Two of these variables, viscosity and vessel length, will change slowly in the body. Only one of these factors, the radius, can be changed rapidly by vasoconstriction and vasodilation, thusdramaticallyimpactingresistanceandflow. Further, smallchangesintheradiuswillgreatlyaffectflow, since it is raised to the fourth power in the equation. Wehavebrieflyconsideredhowcardiacoutputandbloodvolumeimpactbloodflowandpressure; thenextstepisto seehowtheothervariables(contraction, vessellength, andviscosity)articulatewithPouseillesequationandwhattheycan teach ultrasound about the impact on Blood flow. Blood Volume The relationship between Blood volume, Blood Hypertension, and Blood flow is intuitively obvious. Water may merely trickle alongacreekbedinadryseason, butrushquicklyandundergreatpressureafteraheavyrain. Similarly, asbloodvolume decreases, Hypertension and flow decrease. As Blood volume increases, Hypertension and flow increase. Undernormalcircumstances, bloodvolumevarieslittle. Lowbloodvolume, calledhypovolemia, maybecausedby bleeding, dehydration, Vomiting, severeburns, orsomemedicationsusedtotreathypertension. Itisimportanttorecognize that other regulatory mechanisms in the body are so effective at maintaining Blood Hypertension that an individual may be asymptomatic until 1020 percent of the Blood volume has been lost. Treatment typically includes intravenous fluid replacement. Hypervolemia, excessive fluid volume, may be caused by retention of Water and Sodium, as seen in patients with heartfailure, livercirrhosis, someformsofkidneydisease, hyperaldosteronism, andsomeglucocorticoidsteroidtreatments. Restoring homeostasis in these patients depends upon reversing the condition that triggered the hypervolemia. Blood Viscosity Viscosity is the thickness of fluids that affects their ability to flow. Clean Water, for example, is less viscous than mud. The viscosity of Blood is directly proportional to resistance and inversely proportional to flow; therefore, any condition thatcausesviscositytoincreasewillalsoincreaseresistanceanddecreaseflow. Forexample, imaginesippingmilk, then a milkshake, through the same size straw. You experience more resistance and therefore less flow from the milkshake. Conversely, anyconditionthatcausesviscositytodecrease(suchaswhenthemilkshakemelts)willdecreaseresistanceand increase flow. Normallytheviscosityofblooddoesnotchangeovershortperiodsoftime. Thetwoprimarydeterminantsofblood viscosity are the formed elements and plasma proteins. Since the vast majority of formed elements are erythrocytes, any condition affecting erythropoiesis, such as polycythemia or anemia, can alter viscosity. Since most plasma proteins are produced by the Liver, any condition affecting Liver function can also change the viscosity slightly and therefore decreasebloodflow. Liverabnormalitiesincludehepatitis, cirrhosis, alcoholdamage, anddrugtoxicities. Whileleukocytes and platelets are normally a small component of the formed elements, there are some rare conditions in which severe overproduction can impact viscosity as well.

Aswithbloodvolume, thismakesintuitivesense, sincetheincreasedsurfaceareaofthevesselwillimpedethe flow of Blood. Likewise, if the vessel is shortened, the resistance will decrease and flow will increase. The length of our Blood vessels increases throughout childhood as we grow, of course, but is unchanging in adults undernormalphysiologicalcircumstances. Further, thedistributionofvesselsisnotthesameinalltissues. Adiposetissue does not have an extensive vascular supply. One pound of adipose tissue contains approximately 200 miles of vessels, whereas skeletal muscle contains more than twice that. Overall, vessels decrease in length only during loss of mass or amputation. Anindividualweighing150poundshasapproximately60, 000milesofvesselsinthebody. Gainingabout10 poundsaddsfrom2000to4000milesofvessels, dependinguponthenatureofthegainedtissue.

Adecreaseddiametermeansmoreoftheblood contacts the vessel wall, and resistance increases, subsequently decreasing flow. The influence of lumen diameter on resistance is dramatic: A slight increase or decrease in diameter causes a huge decreaseorincreaseinresistance.

The Roles of Vessel Diameter and Total Area in Blood Flow and Blood Hypertension Recallthatweclassifiedarteriolesasresistancevessels, becausegiventheirsmalllumen, theydramaticallyslowtheflow of bloodfromarteries. In fact, arteriolesarethesiteof greatestresistanceintheentirevascularnetwork. Thismayseem surprising, given that capillaries have a smaller size. How can this phenomenon be explained?

Noticeinparts(a)and(b)thatthetotalcross-sectionalareaofthebodyscapillarybedsisfargreater than any other type of vessel. Although the diameter of an individual capillary is significantly smaller than the diameter ofanarteriole, therearevastlymorecapillariesinthebodythanthereareothertypesofbloodvessels. Part(c)showsthat Blood Hypertension drops unevenly as Blood travels from arteries to arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins, and encounters greaterresistance. However, thesiteofthemostprecipitousdrop, andthesiteofgreatestresistance, isthearterioles. This explainswhyvasodilationandvasoconstrictionofarteriolesplaymoresignificantrolesinregulatingbloodpressurethan do the vasodilation and vasoconstriction of other vessels.

Asbloodflowsthroughthe veins, the rate of velocity increases, as Blood is returned to the Heart. 856 CHAPTER 20 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Blood VESSELS AND CIRCULATION Figure20. 13RelationshipsamongVesselsintheSystemicCircuit Therelationshipsamongbloodvesselsthat can be compared include (a) vessel diameter, (b) total cross-sectional area, (c) average Blood Hypertension, and (d) velocity of Blood flow.

Arterywallsthatareconstantlystressed by Blood flowing at High Hypertension are also more likely to be injuredwhich means that hypertension can promote arteriosclerosis, as well as result from it.

Moreover, circulatingtriglyceridesandcholesterolcan seepbetweenthedamagedliningcellsandbecometrappedwithinthearterywall, wheretheyarefrequentlyjoinedby leukocytes, calcium, andcellulardebris. Eventually, thisbuildup, calledplaque, cannarrowarteriesenoughtoimpair Blood flow. The term for this condition, atherosclerosis (athero- porridge) describes the mealy deposits (Figure 20. 14). Figure20. 14Atherosclerosis(a)Atherosclerosiscanresultfromplaquesformedbythebuildupoffatty, calcified deposits in an artery. (b) Plaques can also take other forms, as shown in this micrograph of a coronary artery that has a buildup of connective tissue within the artery wall. LM 40. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School 2012) Sometimes a plaque can rupture, causing microscopic tears in the artery wall that allow Blood to leak into the tissueontheotherside.

Treatment includes lifestyle changes, such as weight loss, smoking cessation, regular exercise, and adoption of a diet Low in Sodium and saturated fats. Medications to reduce cholesterol and Blood Hypertension may be prescribed. For blocked coronary arteries, surgery is warranted. In angioplasty, a catheter is inserted into the vessel at the point 858 CHAPTER 20 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Blood VESSELS AND CIRCULATION of narrowing, and a second catheter with a balloon-like tip is inflated to widen the opening. To prevent subsequent collapse of the vessel, a small mesh tube called a stent is often inserted. In an endarterectomy, plaque is surgically removedfromthewallsofavessel.

First, thepressure in the atria during diastole is very Low, often approaching zero when the atria are relaxed (atrial diastole). Second, two physiologic pumps increase Hypertension in the venous system. The use of the term pump implies a physical device that speeds flow. These physiological pumps are less obvious. Skeletal Muscle Pump Inmanybodyregions, thepressurewithintheveinscanbeincreasedbythecontractionofthesurroundingskeletalmuscle. Thismechanism, knownastheskeletalmusclepump(Figure20. 15), helpsthelower-pressureveinscounteracttheforce of gravity, increasing Hypertension to move Blood back to the Heart. As leg muscles contract, for example during walking or running, theyexertpressureonnearbyveinswiththeirnumerousone-wayvalves.

Note the importance of the one-way valves to assure that Blood flows only in the proper direction. Respiratory Pump Therespiratorypumpaidsbloodflowthroughtheveinsofthethoraxandabdomen. Duringinhalation, thevolumeofthe thoraxincreases, largelythroughthecontractionofthediaphragm, whichmovesdownwardandcompressestheabdominal cavity. The elevation of the chest caused by the contraction of the external intercostal muscles also contributes to the increasedvolumeofthethorax. Thevolumeincreasecausesairpressurewithinthethoraxtodecrease, allowingustoinhale. Additionally, asairpressurewithinthethoraxdrops, bloodpressureinthethoracicveinsalsodecreases, fallingbelowthe pressureintheabdominalveins. Thiscausesbloodtoflowalongitspressuregradientfromveinsoutsidethethorax, where This content is available for free at or at CHAPTER 20 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Blood VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 859 pressureishigher, intothethoracicregion, wherepressureisnowlower.

Duringexhalation, whenairpressureincreaseswithinthethoraciccavity, pressureinthethoracic veinsincreases, speedingbloodflowintotheheartwhilevalvesintheveinspreventbloodfromflowingbackwardfromthe thoracic and abdominal veins. Hypertension Relationships in the Venous System Althoughvesseldiameterincreasesfromthesmallervenulestothelargerveinsandeventuallytothevenaecavae(singular venacava), thetotalcross-sectionalareaactuallydecreases(seeFigure20. 15aandb). Theindividualveinsarelargerin diameter than the venules, but their total number is much lower, so their total cross-sectional area is also lower. Also notice that, as Blood moves from venules to veins, the average Blood Hypertension drops (see Figure 20. 15c), but thebloodvelocityactuallyincreases(seeFigure20. 15). Thispressuregradientdrivesbloodbacktowardtheheart. Again, the presence of one-way valves and the skeletal muscle and respiratory pumps contribute to this increased flow. Since approximately64percentofthetotalbloodvolumeresidesinsystemicveins, anyactionthatincreasestheflowofblood through the veins will increase venous return to the Heart. Maintaining vascular tone within the veins prevents the veins from merely distending, dampening the flow of Blood, and as you will see, vasoconstriction actually enhances the flow. The Role of Venoconstriction in Resistance, Blood Hypertension, and Flow Aspreviouslydiscussed, vasoconstrictionofanarteryorarterioledecreasestheradius, increasingresistanceandpressure, but decreasing flow. Venoconstriction, on the other hand, has a very different outcome. The walls of veins are thin but irregular; thus, when the smooth muscle in those walls constricts, the lumen becomes more rounded. The more rounded thelumen, thelesssurfaceareathebloodencounters, andthelessresistancethevesseloffers. Vasoconstrictionincreases Hypertension within a vein as it does in an artery, but in veins, the increased Hypertension increases flow. Recall that the Hypertension intheatria, intowhichthevenousbloodwillflow, isverylow, approachingzeroforatleastpartoftherelaxationphase of the cardiac cycle. Thus, venoconstriction increases the return of Blood to the Heart. Another way of stating this is that venoconstriction increases the preload or stretch of the cardiac muscle and increases contraction. 20. 3 Capillary Exchange By the end of this section, you will be able to: Identify the primary mechanisms of capillary exchange Distinguishbetweencapillaryhydrostaticpressureandbloodcolloidosmoticpressure, explainingthecontribution of each to net filtration Hypertension Compare filtration and reabsorption Explain the fate of fluid that is not reabsorbed from the tissues into the vascular capillaries Theprimarypurposeofthecardiovascularsystemistocirculategases, nutrients, wastes, andothersubstancestoandfrom thecellsofthebody.

Bulk Flow Themassmovementoffluidsintoandoutofcapillarybedsrequiresatransportmechanismfarmoreefficientthanmere diffusion. Thismovement, oftenreferredtoasbulkflow, involvestwopressure-drivenmechanisms: Volumesoffluidmove from an area of higher Hypertension in a capillary bed to an area of lower Hypertension in the tissues via filtration. In contrast, the movement of fluid from an area of higher Hypertension in the tissues into an area of lower Hypertension in the capillaries is reabsorption.",
    "Two types of Hypertension interact to drive each of these movements: hydrostatic Hypertension and osmotic Hypertension. Hydrostatic Hypertension Theprimaryforcedrivingfluidtransportbetweenthecapillariesandtissuesishydrostaticpressure, whichcanbedefined as the Hypertension of any fluid enclosed in a space. Blood hydrostatic Hypertension is the force exerted by the Blood confined withinbloodvesselsorheartchambers. Evenmorespecifically, thepressureexertedbybloodagainstthewallofacapillary iscalledcapillaryhydrostaticpressure(CHP), andisthesameascapillarybloodpressure. CHPistheforcethatdrives fluid out of capillaries and into the tissues. As fluid exits a capillary and moves into tissues, the hydrostatic Hypertension in the interstitial fluid correspondingly rises. Thisopposinghydrostaticpressureiscalledtheinterstitialfluidhydrostaticpressure(IFHP). Generally, theCHP originating from the arterial pathways is considerably higher than the IFHP, because lymphatic vessels are continually 860 CHAPTER 20 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Blood VESSELS AND CIRCULATION absorbingexcessfluidfromthetissues. Thus, fluidgenerallymovesoutofthecapillaryandintotheinterstitialfluid. This process is called filtration. Osmotic Hypertension The net Hypertension that drives reabsorptionthe movement of fluid from the interstitial fluid back into the capillariesis called osmotic Hypertension (sometimes referred to as oncotic Hypertension). Whereas hydrostatic Hypertension forces fluid out of the capillary, osmoticpressuredrawsfluidbackin. Osmoticpressureisdeterminedbyosmoticconcentrationgradients, thatis, thedifferenceinthesolute-to-waterconcentrationsinthebloodandtissuefluid. Aregionhigherinsoluteconcentration(and lowerinwaterconcentration)drawswateracrossasemipermeablemembranefromaregionhigherinwaterconcentration (and lower in solute concentration). Aswediscussosmoticpressureinbloodandtissuefluid, itisimportanttorecognizethattheformedelementsofblood do not contributeto osmotic concentrationgradients. Rather, it is the plasma proteins that play the key role. Solutes also moveacrossthecapillarywallaccordingtotheirconcentrationgradient, butoverall, theconcentrationsshouldbesimilar andnothaveasignificantimpactonosmosis. Becauseoftheirlargesizeandchemicalstructure, plasmaproteinsarenot trulysolutes, thatis, theydonotdissolvebutaredispersedorsuspendedintheirfluidmedium, formingacolloidratherthan a solution. The Hypertension created by the concentration of colloidal proteins in the Blood is called the Blood colloidal osmotic Hypertension(BCOP). Itseffectoncapillaryexchangeaccountsforthereabsorptionofwater. Theplasmaproteinssuspended in Blood cannot move across the semipermeable capillary cell membrane, and so they remain in the plasma. As a result, bloodhasahighercolloidalconcentrationandlowerwaterconcentrationthantissuefluid. Itthereforeattractswater. Wecan alsosaythattheBCOPishigherthantheinterstitialfluidcolloidalosmoticpressure(IFCOP), whichisalwaysverylow becauseinterstitialfluidcontainsfewproteins. Thus, waterisdrawnfromthetissuefluidbackintothecapillary, carrying dissolved molecules with it. This difference in colloidal osmotic Hypertension accounts for reabsorption.

Sincefiltrationis, bydefinition, themovement of fluid out of the capillary, when reabsorption is occurring, the NFP is a negative number. NFP changes at different points in a capillary bed (Figure 20. 16). Close to the arterial end of the capillary, it is approximately10mmHg, becausetheCHPof35mmHgminustheBCOPof25mmHgequals10mmHg.

Neural Regulation Thenervoussystemplaysacriticalroleintheregulationofvascularhomeostasis. Theprimaryregulatorysitesincludethe cardiovascular centers in the brain that control both cardiac and vascular functions. In addition, more generalized neural responses from the limbic system and the autonomic nervous system are factors. The Cardiovascular Centers in the Brain Neurologicalregulationofbloodpressureandflowdependsonthecardiovascularcenterslocatedinthemedullaoblongata. Thisclusterofneuronsrespondstochangesinbloodpressureaswellasbloodconcentrationsofoxygen, carbondioxide, and hydrogen ions. The cardiovascular center contains three distinct paired components: The cardioaccelerator centers stimulate cardiac function by regulating Heart rate and stroke volume via sympathetic stimulation from the cardiac accelerator nerve. 864 CHAPTER 20 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Blood VESSELS AND CIRCULATION The cardioinhibitor centers slow cardiac function by decreasing Heart rate and stroke volume via parasympathetic stimulation from the vagus nerve. The vasomotor centers control vessel tone or contraction of the smooth muscle in the tunica media. Changes in diameteraffectperipheralresistance, Hypertension, andflow, whichaffectcardiacoutput. Themajorityoftheseneurons act via the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons. Although each center functions independently, they are not anatomically distinct. Thereisalsoasmallpopulationofneuronsthatcontrolvasodilationinthevesselsofthebrainandskeletalmuscles by relaxing the smooth muscle fibers in the vessel tunics. Many of these are cholinergic neurons, that is, they release acetylcholine, whichinturnstimulatesthevesselsendothelialcellstoreleasenitricoxide(NO), whichcausesvasodilation. Others release norepinephrine that binds to β2receptors. A few neurons release NO directly as a neurotransmitter. Recallthatmildstimulationoftheskeletalmusclesmaintainsmuscletone. Asimilarphenomenonoccurswithvascular toneinvessels. Asnotedearlier, arteriolesarenormallypartiallyconstricted: Withmaximalstimulation, theirradiusmay be reduced to one-half of the resting state. Full dilation of most arterioles requires that this sympathetic stimulation be suppressed. When it is, an arteriole can expand by as much as 150 percent. Such a significant increase can dramatically affect resistance, Hypertension, and flow. Baroreceptor Reflexes Baroreceptorsarespecializedstretchreceptorslocatedwithinthinareasofbloodvesselsandheartchambersthatrespond tothedegreeofstretchcausedbythepresenceofblood. Theysendimpulsestothecardiovascularcentertoregulateblood Hypertension.

Atlowerbloodpressures, thedegreeofstretchislowerandtherateoffiringisslower. Whenthecardiovascularcenter in the medulla oblongata receives this input, it triggers a reflex that maintains homeostasis (Figure 20. 18): When Blood Hypertension rises too High, the baroreceptors fire at a higher rate and trigger parasympathetic stimulation oftheheart. Asaresult, cardiacoutputfalls. Sympatheticstimulationoftheperipheralarterioleswillalsodecrease, resulting in vasodilation. Combined, these activities cause Blood Hypertension to fall. When Blood Hypertension drops too Low, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases. This will trigger an increase in sympatheticstimulationoftheheart, causingcardiacoutputtoincrease. Itwillalsotriggersympatheticstimulationof the peripheral vessels, resulting in vasoconstriction. Combined, these activities cause Blood Hypertension to rise.

Chemoreceptorsmonitoringthebloodarelocatedincloseproximitytothe baroreceptorsintheaorticandcarotidsinuses. Theysignalthecardiovascularcenteraswellastherespiratorycentersinthe medulla oblongata. Sincetissuesconsumeoxygenandproducecarbondioxideandacidsaswasteproducts, whenthebodyismoreactive, oxygenlevelsfallandcarbondioxidelevelsriseascellsundergocellularrespirationtomeettheenergyneedsofactivities. This causes more hydrogen ions to be produced, causing the Blood pH to drop. When the body is resting, oxygen levels arehigher, carbondioxidelevelsarelower, morehydrogenisbound, andpHrises. (Seekadditionalcontentformoredetail about pH. ) The chemoreceptors respond to increasing carbon dioxide and hydrogen ion levels (falling pH) by stimulating the cardioacceleratorandvasomotorcenters, increasingcardiacoutputandconstrictingperipheralvessels. Thecardioinhibitor centers are suppressed. With falling carbon dioxide and hydrogen ion levels (increasing pH), the cardioinhibitor centers are stimulated, and the cardioaccelerator and vasomotor centers are suppressed, decreasing cardiac output and causing peripheralvasodilation.

Inturn, thecardiovascular system will transport these gases to the lungs for exchange, again in accordance with metabolic demands. This interrelationship of cardiovascular and respiratory control cannot be overemphasized. Other neural mechanisms can also have a significant impact on cardiovascular function. These include the limbic systemthatlinksphysiologicalresponsestopsychologicalstimuli, aswellasgeneralizedsympatheticandparasympathetic stimulation. Endocrine Regulation Endocrinecontroloverthecardiovascularsysteminvolvesthecatecholamines, epinephrineandnorepinephrine, aswellas several hormones that interact with the kidneys in the regulation of Blood volume. 866 CHAPTER 20 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Blood VESSELS AND CIRCULATION Epinephrine and Norepinephrine The catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine are released by the adrenal medulla, and enhance and extend the bodyssympatheticorfight-or-flightresponse(seeFigure20. 17). Theyincreaseheartrateandforceofcontraction, while temporarilyconstrictingbloodvesselstoorgansnotessentialforflight-or-fightresponsesandredirectingbloodflowtothe Liver, muscles, and Heart. Antidiuretic Hormone Antidiuretichormone(ADH), alsoknownasvasopressin, issecretedbythecellsinthehypothalamusandtransportedvia the hypothalamic-hypophyseal tracts to the posterior pituitary where it is stored until released upon nervous stimulation.

In addition, ADH constricts peripheral vessels. Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone Mechanism Therenin-angiotensin-aldosteronemechanismhasamajoreffectuponthecardiovascularsystem(Figure20. 19). Reninis an enzyme, although because of its importance in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway, some sources identify it as a hormone. Specialized cells in the kidneys found in the juxtaglomerular apparatus respond to decreased Blood flow by secretingreninintotheblood. Reninconvertstheplasmaproteinangiotensinogen, whichisproducedbytheliver, intoits activeformangiotensinI. AngiotensinIcirculatesinthebloodandisthenconvertedintoangiotensinIIinthelungs. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). AngiotensinIIisapowerfulvasoconstrictor, greatlyincreasingbloodpressure. ItalsostimulatesthereleaseofADH andaldosterone, ahormoneproducedbytheadrenalcortex. Aldosteroneincreasesthereabsorptionofsodiumintotheblood bythekidneys. Sincewaterfollowssodium, thisincreasesthereabsorptionofwater. Thisinturnincreasesbloodvolume, raising Blood Hypertension. Angiotensin II also stimulates the thirst center in the hypothalamus, so an individual will likely consume more fluids, again increasing Blood volume and Hypertension. Figure 20. 19 Hormones Involved in Renal Control of Blood Hypertension In the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism, increasingangiotensinIIwillstimulatetheproductionofantidiuretichormoneandaldosterone. Inaddition torenin, thekidneysproduceerythropoietin, whichstimulatestheproductionofredbloodcells, furtherincreasingblood volume. Erythropoietin Erythropoietin (erythropoietin) is released by the kidneys when Blood flow and/or oxygen levels decrease. erythropoietin stimulates the production of erythrocytes within the bone marrow. Erythrocytes are the major formed element of the Blood and may contribute 40 percent or more to Blood volume, a significant factor of viscosity, resistance, Hypertension, and flow. In addition, EPOisavasoconstrictor. OverproductionofEPOorexcessiveintakeofsyntheticEPO, oftentoenhanceathletic performance, will increase viscosity, resistance, and Hypertension, and decrease flow in addition to its contribution as a vasoconstrictor. Atrial Natriuretic Hormone Secreted by cells in the atria of the Heart, atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH) (also known as atrial natriuretic peptide) is secretedwhenbloodvolumeishighenoughtocauseextremestretchingofthecardiaccells.

All of these actions promote loss of fluid from the body, so Blood volume and Blood Hypertension drop. Autoregulation of Perfusion As the name would suggest, autoregulation mechanisms require neither specialized nervous stimulation nor endocrine control. Rather, thesearelocal, self-regulatorymechanismsthatalloweachregionoftissuetoadjustitsbloodflowand thus its perfusion. These local mechanisms include chemical signals and myogenic controls.

    "These local mechanisms include chemical signals and myogenic controls. Chemical Signals Involved in Autoregulation Chemicalsignalsworkattheleveloftheprecapillarysphincterstotriggereitherconstrictionorrelaxation. Asyouknow, opening a precapillary sphincter allows Blood to flow into that particular capillary, whereas constricting a precapillary sphincter temporarily shuts off Blood flow to that region. The factors involved in regulating the precapillary sphincters include the following: Opening of the sphincter is triggered in response to decreased oxygen concentrations; increased carbon dioxide concentrations; increasinglevelsoflacticacidorotherbyproductsofcellularmetabolism; increasingconcentrations of Potassium ions or hydrogen ions (falling pH); inflammatory chemicals such as histamines; and increased body temperature. TheseconditionsinturnstimulatethereleaseofNO, apowerfulvasodilator, fromendothelialcells(see Figure 20. 17). Contraction of the precapillary sphincter is triggered by the opposite levels of the regulators, which prompt the releaseofendothelins, powerfulvasoconstrictingpeptidessecretedbyendothelialcells. Plateletsecretionsandcertain prostaglandins may also trigger constriction. Again, these factors alter tissue perfusion via their effects on the precapillarysphincter mechanism, which regulates bloodflowtocapillaries. Sincetheamountofbloodislimited, notallcapillariescanfillatonce, sobloodflowisallocated basedupontheneedsandmetabolicstateofthetissuesasreflectedintheseparameters.

Whenbloodflowistoohigh, thesmooth muscle will contract in response to the increased stretch, prompting vasoconstriction that reduces Blood flow.

Thisincreaseinsizegenerallymakes the Heart stronger and more efficient at pumping Blood, increasing both stroke volume and cardiac output. Tissue perfusion also increases as the body transitions from a resting state to light exercise and eventually to heavy exercise(seeFigure20. 20). Thesechangesresultinselectivevasodilationintheskeletalmuscles, Heart, lungs, Liver, and integument. Simultaneously, vasoconstriction occurs in the vessels leading to the kidneys and most of the digestive and reproductive organs. The flow of Blood to the brain remains largely unchanged whether at rest or exercising, since the vessels in the brain largely do not respond to regulatory stimuli, in most cases, because they lack the appropriate receptors.

ListentothisCDCpodcast( as a silent killer. What steps can you take to reduce your risk of a Heart attack or stroke? Hemorrhage Minor Blood loss is managed by hemostasis and repair. Hemorrhage is a loss of Blood that cannot be controlled by hemostatic mechanisms. Initially, the body responds to hemorrhage by initiating mechanisms aimed at increasing Blood Hypertension and maintaining Blood flow. Ultimately, however, Blood volume will need to be restored, either through physiological processes or through medical intervention. In response to Blood loss, stimuli from the baroreceptors trigger the cardiovascular centers to stimulate sympathetic responsestoincreasecardiacoutputandvasoconstriction. Thistypicallypromptstheheartratetoincreasetoabout180200 contractions per minute, restoring cardiac output to normal levels. Vasoconstriction of the arterioles increases vascular resistance, whereasconstrictionoftheveinsincreasesvenousreturntotheheart. Bothofthesestepswillhelpincreaseblood Hypertension.

Treatmentsgenerallyinvolveprovidingintravenousfluidstorestorethepatienttonormalfunctionandvariousdrugs such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine to raise Blood Hypertension. Cardiogenic shock results from the inability of the Heart to maintain cardiac output. Most often, it results from a myocardial infarction (Heart attack), but it may also be caused by arrhythmias, valve disorders, cardiomyopathies, cardiac failure, or simply insufficient flow of Blood through the cardiac vessels. Treatment involves repairing the damage to the Heart or its vessels to resolve the underlying cause, rather than treating cardiogenic shock directly.

Barrierdefensesarepartofthebodysmostbasicdefensemechanisms. Thebarrier defenses are not a response to infections, but they are continuously working to protect against a broad range of pathogens.

Inflammationispartofaverybasicformofimmuneresponse. Theprocessnotonlybringsfluidandcellsinto thesitetodestroythepathogenandremoveitanddebrisfromthesite, butalsohelpstoisolatethesite, limitingthespread of the pathogen. Acute inflammation is a short-term inflammatory response to an insult to the body. If the cause of the inflammationisnotresolved, however, itcanleadtochronicinflammation, whichisassociatedwithmajortissuedestruction andfibrosis. Chronicinflammationisongoinginflammation. Itcanbecausedbyforeignbodies, persistentpathogens, and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. There are four important parts to the inflammatory response: Tissue Injury. The released contents of injured cells stimulate the release of mast cell granules and their potent inflammatory mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins. Histamine increases the diameter of local Blood vessels (vasodilation), causing an increase in Blood flow. Histamine also increases the permeability of local capillaries, causing plasma to leak out and form interstitial fluid. This causes the Edema associated with inflammation. Additionally, injuredcells, phagocytes, andbasophilsaresourcesofinflammatorymediators, includingprostaglandins andleukotrienes. Leukotrienesattractneutrophilsfromthebloodbychemotaxisandincreasevascularpermeability. Prostaglandins cause vasodilation by relaxing vascular smooth muscle and are a major cause of the Pain associated with inflammation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen relieve Pain by inhibiting prostaglandin production. Vasodilation. Many inflammatory mediators such as histamine are vasodilators that increase the diameters of local capillaries. Thiscausesincreasedbloodflowandisresponsiblefortheheatandrednessofinflamedtissue. Itallows greater access of the Blood to the site of inflammation. Increased Vascular Permeability. At the same time, inflammatory mediators increase the permeability of the local vasculature, causing leakage of fluid into the interstitial space, resulting in the Edema, or Edema, associated with inflammation. Recruitment of Phagocytes. Leukotrienes are particularly Good at attracting neutrophils from the Blood to the site of infection by chemotaxis. Following an early neutrophil infiltrate stimulated by macrophage cytokines, more macrophagesarerecruitedtocleanupthedebrisleftoveratthesite. Whenlocalinfectionsaresevere, neutrophilsare attractedtothesitesofinfectionsinlargenumbers, andastheyphagocytosethepathogensandsubsequentlydie, their accumulated cellular remains are visible as pus at the infection site. Overall, inflammation is valuable for many reasons. Not only are the pathogens killed and debris removed, but the increaseinvascularpermeabilityencouragestheentryofclottingfactors, thefirststeptowardswoundrepair. Inflammation also facilitates the transport of antigen to lymph nodes by dendritic cells for the development of the adaptive immune response. 938 CHAPTER 21 THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 21. 3 The Adaptive Immune Response: T lymphocytes and Their Functional Types By the end of this section, you will be able to: Explain the advantages of the adaptive immune response over the innate immune response List the various characteristics of an antigen Describe the types of T cell antigen receptors Outline the steps of T cell development Describe the major T cell types and their functions Innateimmuneresponses(andearlyinducedresponses)areinmanycasesineffectiveatcompletelycontrollingpathogen growth. However, they slow pathogen growth and allow time for the adaptive immune response to strengthen and either controloreliminatethepathogen. Theinnateimmunesystemalsosendssignalstothecellsoftheadaptiveimmunesystem, guiding them in how to attack the pathogen. Thus, these are the two important arms of the immune response. The Benefits of the Adaptive Immune Response The specificity of the adaptive immune responseits ability to specifically recognize and make a response against a wide variety of pathogensis its great strength. Antigens, the small chemical groups often associated with pathogens, are recognized by receptors on the surface of B and T lymphocytes. The adaptive immune response to these antigens is so versatile that it can respond to nearly any pathogen. This increase in specificity comes because the adaptive immune 11 response has a unique way to develop as many as 10, or 100 trillion, different receptors to recognize nearly every conceivablepathogen. Howcouldsomanydifferenttypesofantibodiesbeencoded? Andwhataboutthemanyspecificities ofTcells? ThereisnotnearlyenoughDNAinacelltohaveaseparategeneforeachspecificity.",
    "Different bacterial strains differ in the antigens on their surfaces. The immune response against one strain (antigen) does not affect the other; thus, the species survives. Anothermethodofimmuneevasionismutation. Becausevirusessurfacemoleculesmutatecontinuously, viruseslike influenzachangeenougheachyearthatthefluvaccineforoneyearmaynotprotectagainsttheflucommontothenext. New vaccine formulations must be derived for each flu season. Genetic recombinationthe combining of gene segments from two different pathogensis an efficient form of immuneevasion. Forexample, theinfluenzaviruscontainsgenesegmentsthatcanrecombinewhentwodifferentviruses infect the same cell. Recombination between human and pig influenza viruses led to the 2010 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. Pathogens can produce immunosuppressive molecules that impair immune function, and there are several different types. Virusesareespeciallygoodatevadingtheimmuneresponseinthisway, andmanytypesofviruseshavebeenshown to suppress the host immune response in ways much more subtle than the wholesale destruction caused by HIV. 21. 6 Diseases Associated with Depressed or Overactive Immune Responses By the end of this section, you will be able to: Discuss inherited and acquired immunodeficiencies Explain the four types of hypersensitivity and how they differ Give an example of how autoimmune disease breaks tolerance Thissectionisabouthowtheimmunesystemgoeswrong.

WhatgroupsthemtogetheristhefactthatboththeBcell and T cell arms of the adaptive immune response are affected. Children with this disease usually die of opportunistic infections within their first year of life unless they receive a bone marrow transplant. Such a procedure had not yet been perfected for David Vetter, the boy in the bubble, who was treated for SCID by having to live almost his entire life in a sterile plastic cocoon for the 12 years before his death frominfectionin1984.

It is worth discussing the biology of this virus, which can lead to the well-known AIDS, so that its full effects on the immune system can be understood.

Because seroconversiontakesdifferentlengthsoftimeindifferentindividuals, multipleAIDStestsaregivenmonthsaparttoconfirm or eliminate the possibility of infection. After seroconversion, the amount of virus circulating in the Blood drops and stays at a Low level for several years.

Still, itisuseful for this discussion to use the four types of hypersensitivities as a guide to understand these mechanisms (Figure 21. 28). 956 CHAPTER 21 THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM Figure 21.",
    "28). 956 CHAPTER 21 THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM Figure 21. 28 Immune Hypersensitivity Components of the immune system cause four types of hypersensitivity. Notice that types IIII are B cell mediated, whereas type IV hypersensitivity is exclusively a T cell phenomenon. Immediate (Type I) Hypersensitivity Antigensthatcauseallergicresponsesareoftenreferredtoasallergens. Thespecificityoftheimmediatehypersensitivity responseispredicatedonthebindingofallergen-specificIgEtothemastcellsurface. Theprocessofproducingallergenspecific IgE is called sensitization, and is a necessary prerequisite for the symptoms of immediate hypersensitivity to occur. Allergies and allergic asthma are mediated by mast cell degranulation that is caused by the crosslinking of the antigen-specific IgE molecules on the mast cell surface. The mediators released have various vasoactive effects already discussed, but the major symptoms of inhaled allergens are the nasal Edema and runny nose caused by the increased vascular permeability and increased Blood flow of nasal Blood vessels. As these mediators are released with mast cell degranulation, type I hypersensitivity reactions are usually rapid and occur within just a few minutes, hence the term immediate hypersensitivity. Most allergens are in themselves nonpathogenic and therefore innocuous. Some individuals develop mild allergies, which are usually treated with antihistamines. Others develop severe allergies that may cause anaphylactic shock, which can potentially be fatal within 20 to 30 minutes if untreated. This drop in Blood Hypertension (shock) with accompanying contractions of bronchial smooth muscle is caused by systemic mast cell degranulation when an allergen is eaten (for example, shellfish and peanuts), injected (by a bee sting or being administered penicillin), or inhaled (asthma). Because epinephrine raises Blood Hypertension and relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, it is routinely used to counteract the effects of anaphylaxis and can be lifesaving. Patients with known severe allergies are encouraged to keep automatic epinephrine injectors with them at all times, especially when away from easy access to hospitals.

This content is available for free at or at CHAPTER 21 THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 957 Delayed (Type IV) Hypersensitivity Delayed hypersensitivity, or type IV hypersensitivity, is basically a standard cellular immune response. In delayed hypersensitivity, the first exposure to an antigen is called sensitization, such that on re-exposure, a secondary cellular responseresults, secretingcytokinesthatrecruitmacrophagesandotherphagocytestothesite.

Thetrigger forthesediseasesis, moreoftenthannot, unknown, andthetreatmentsareusuallybasedonresolvingthesymptomsusing immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids. These diseases can be localized and crippling, as in rheumatoidarthritis, ordiffuseinthebodywithmultiplesymptomsthatdifferindifferentindividuals, asisthecasewith systemic lupus erythematosus (Figure 21. 29).

Ontheotherhand, sometheoriespropose that having multiple common infectious diseases actually prevents autoimmune responses. The fact that autoimmune diseases are rare in countries that have a High incidence of infectious diseases supports this idea, another example of the hygiene hypothesis discussed earlier in this chapter. There are genetic factors in autoimmune diseases as well.",
