The purpose of this study was to sustained hypertension. Similar results were obtained by investigate the relationship between MH and left atrial (LA) two-dimensional echocardiographic strain analysis.

At the beginning of the new millennium, the increasing detailsregardingLAvolume(LAV)andphasicfunction, use of ambulatory Blood Hypertension (blood pressure) monitoring and they did not find a significant difference between (ABPM) has revealed the whole range of different blood pressure normotensive control, sustained hypertensive, and MH patterns such as white-coat hypertension, sustained patients. 10 In addition, LA remodeling could signifihypertension, nocturnal hypertension, and normotencantly contribute to increased morbidity and mortality sion.
