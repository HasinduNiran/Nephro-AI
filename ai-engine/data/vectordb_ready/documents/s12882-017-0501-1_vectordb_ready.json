Nitric Oxide (NO) promotes renal Water and sodiumexcretion, buttheeffectisunknowninthenephronsprincipalcells. Inadose-responsestudy, wemeasured theeffectoftolvaptanonrenalhandlingofwaterandsodiumandsystemichemodynamics, duringbaselineandNOinhibitionwithL-NMMA(L-NG-monomethyl-arginine). Methods: Inarandomized, placebo-controlled, doubleblind, crossoverstudy, 15healthysubjectsreceivedtolvaptan 15, 30and45mgorplacebo. L-NMMAwasgivenasabolusfollowedbycontinuousinfusionduring60min. We measuredurineoutput(UO), freewaterclearance(C ), fractionalexcretionofsodium(FE ), urinaryaquaporin-2 H2O sodium channels(u-AQP2)andepithelialsodiumchannels(u-ENaCγ), plasmavasopressin(p-AVP)andcentralbloodpressure(cBP). Results: Duringbaseline, FE sodium wasunchanged. Tolvaptandecreasedu-ENaCγdose-dependentlyandincreasedp-AVP threefold, whereas u-AQP2 was unchanged. During tolvaptan with NO-inhibition, UO and C decreased H2O dose-dependently. FE sodium decreaseddose-independentlyandu-ENaCγremainedunchanged. CentralBPincreased equallyafteralltreatments. Conclusions: Duringbaseline, fractionalexcretionofsodiumwasunchanged. DuringtolvaptanwithNO-inhibition, renalwaterexcretionwasreduceddosedependently, andrenalsodiumexcretionwasreducedunrelatedtothedose, partlyviaanAVPdependentmechanism. Thus, tolvaptan antagonized the reduction in renal Water and Sodium excretionduringNO-inhibition. Mostlikely, thelackofdecreaseinAQP2excretionbytolvaptancouldbeattributedto acounteractingeffectofthehighlevelofp-AVP. Trialregistration: ClinicalTrialno: NCT02078973. Registered1March2014.

This may reflect an interaction between 24 h post-dosing. Based on the pharmacological profile theV2 receptor system and the NO system, expressed as a higher level of Water excretion after tolvaptan. Thus, tolvaptan partly antagonized the antidiuretic action of L-NMMA. This is in agreement with NO having a stimulating effect on renal Water excretion in the renal principal cells that seemed to be partly AVP-dependent.

    "A possible explanation of this discrepancy could be that tolvaptan was given 2 h earlier, at 6: 00 AM versus 8: 00 AM in the present study. Therefore, tolvaptan exerted its effect over a longer period before the L-NMMAintervention.
