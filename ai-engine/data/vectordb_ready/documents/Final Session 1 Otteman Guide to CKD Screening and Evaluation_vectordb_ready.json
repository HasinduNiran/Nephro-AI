Normal glomerular filtration rate varies according to age, sex, and body size, and declines with age. The National Kidney Foundation recommends using the chronic kidney disease-EPI Creatinine Equation (2009) to estimate glomerular filtration rate. Other useful calculators related to Kidney disease include MDRD and Cockroft Gault. Labs most commonly report out MDRD estimated glomerular filtration rate o glomerular filtration rate calculators are available online at www.

Decreased glomerular filtration rate in the elderly requires adjustment in drug o dosages, as with other patients with chronic kidney disease. Coresh J, et al. Am J Kidney Dis. 2003; 41(1): 1-12.

Screening Tools: albumin-creatinine ratio Urinary albumin-to-Creatinine ratio (albumin-creatinine ratio) is calculated by dividing albumin concentration in milligrams by Creatinine concentration in grams.

Observational Studies of Early vs. Late Nephrology Consultation However there are no randomized trials of early versus late nephrology referral in the literature. Interpreting the approximately 50 published o observational studies that assessed the timing of nephrology referral is complicated by heterogeneity in study design and variable definitions of early referral. Greater choice of treatment options, including home hemodialysis, peritoneal Dialysis and preemptive Kidney transplantation, are associated with early initiation of nephrology services Case Question 3 All of the following adult patients should be referred for nephrology consultation, EXCEPT? A. Initial visit: estimated glomerular filtration rate 26 3 months later: estimated glomerular filtration rate 28 (milliliters per minute/1. 73m2) B. Initial visit: estimated glomerular filtration rate 55, 3 months later: estimated glomerular filtration rate 43 confirmed with repeat estimated glomerular filtration rate 45 (milliliters per minute/1. 73m2) C. Initial visit: albumin-creatinine ratio 450 (magnesium/g) 3 months later: albumin-creatinine ratio 355 (magnesium/g) on both dates the estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 milliliters per minute/1.",

Initial visit: estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 3 months later: estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 (milliliters per minute/1. 73m2) with personal history of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease. E. Initial visit: estimated glomerular filtration rate 42 3 months later: estimated glomerular filtration rate 44 (milliliters per minute/1. 73m2) on both dates the albumin-creatinine ratio 30 magnesium/g. Questions and Self-Assessment Take Home Points PCPs play an important role Identify risk factors Know patients estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria to help guide appropriate treatment strategies Partner and refer to specialist Self Assessment Questions 1. Modifiable risk factors for chronic kidney disease include: o Di abetes o Hypertension o History of acute kidney injury o Frequent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use All of the above o Rationale: Diabetes, hypertension, history of acute kidney injury, and frequent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use can all damage the kidneys and are risk factors for chronic kidney disease 2. National Kidney Foundation recommends the following calculator be used to estimate glomerular filtration rate for chronic kidney disease staging: chronic kidney disease-EPI o o MDRD o Cockroft-Gault o All of the above Rationale: chronic kidney disease-EPI is less biased than MDRD particularly at High GFRs and performs equally, or better compared to the MDRD equation in various age groups and all body mass index groups (except those with a body mass index 20) and is calibrated for the IDMS standardized Creatinine available from all labs Questions and Answers Additional Resources Centers for Disease Control and Preventions chronic kidney disease Surveillance Project: kidney disease National Kidney Disease Education Program (NKDEP): National Kidney Foundation chronic kidney disease: A Global Public Health Crisis National Kidney Foundation App: GLOMERULAR estimated glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate) Calculator Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative/glomerular filtration rate Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) 2012 chronic kidney disease Guidelines Disease: Improving Global Outcomes. org/home/ The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) National Kidney Foundation Safety card for Patient Care: The chart summarizes cautionary safety recommendations for physicians when prescribing medications in people with chronic kidney disease."
