The report includes modelling of some illustrative interventions for adults with chronic kidney disease, risk factors associated with chronic kidney disease and changes in the health economic burden of treatment of kidney disease over the next ten years. Kidney disease is a major challenge for health care systems around the world, and its prevalence is increasing. There have been various papers prepared on the health economics of kidney disease in the UK, although there has not been a comprehensive report prepared since 2012. This report was prepared by ZS Associates in collaboration with Kidney Research UK and the expert advisory steering group in 2023. About Kidney Research UK Kidney Research UK is the leading charity in the UK focused on funding research into the prevention, treatment and management of kidney disease. Our vision is the day when everyone lives free from kidney disease and for more than 60 years the research we fund has been making an impact. But kidney disease is increasing as are the factors contributing to it, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity, making our work more essential than ever. At Kidney Research UK we work with clinicians and scientists across the UK, funding and facilitating research into all areas of kidney disease. We collaborate with partners across the public, private and third sectors to prevent kidney disease and drive innovation to transform treatments. Over the last ten years we have invested more than 58 million into research. We lobby governments and decision makers to change policy and practice to ensure that more than 3 million people living with the most severe stages of kidney disease in the UK have access to the most effective care and treatment, and to make kidney disease a priority. Most importantly, we also work closely with patients, ensuring their voice is heard and is at the centre of everything we do, from deciding which research to invest in to how we plan our priorities and our work across the charity.",
    "Those patient contributions are vital, always helping ultrasound and our partners to understand what life is like with kidney disease, always ensuring we see the patient behind the treatment and always reminding ultrasound that behind every statistic and every number is a person the patients and the carers who inspire our mission and push ultrasound forward to make a difference and change the future of kidney disease. 8 Foreword Professor Sir Stephen Powis National Medical Director of NHS England Professor of Renal Medicine at University College London This is the most comprehensive review of the health economics of kidney disease in the UK for more than ten years. At a time of unprecedented health system pressures, and an ageing population, this report is timely and welcome. Kidney disease is on the increase and there is no cure. It is a life changing disease that can put a significant strain on the body, often referred to as the silent killer, and yet it is not as widely recognised or acknowledged as other long-term conditions. Globally, kidney disease is forecast to be the fifth leading cause of premature death by 2040, and often progresses undiagnosed, until its later stages, due to a lack of symptoms. It can affect anyone. In the UK, more than three million people are living with the most severe stages of kidney disease and this is increasing rapidly. Factors contributing to kidney disease are also growing, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity, and people with kidney disease are also at increased risk of heart attack or stroke. The case for action is more urgent than ever. The later the diagnosis, the greater the impact on the patient. In its late stages, kidney disease is life changing for patients, with few treatment options available. There is an enormous impact on quality of life for patients and for their families and carers, in addition to significant emotional and financial burdens. Until a cure for kidney disease is developed, only early diagnosis, new and effective prevention strategies and better management of kidney disease can reduce its incidence and slow progression. This report estimates that the current economic burden of kidney disease to the UK is 7bn with 6. 4bn of this related to direct NHS costs; these figures could grow to as much as 13. 9bn and 10. 9bn, respectively by 2033. This report serves as a stark call to action for stakeholders across the public, private, academic and health sectors to come together to implement its recommendations, improve prevention, management and treatment, and drive the research and innovation that could end kidney disease. Professor Sir Stephen Powis 9 Key Findings 1 In the UK, there are approximately 3. 25 million people living with chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) stages 3-5. A further 3. 9 million people are estimated to have chronic kidney disease 2 By 2033, the number stages 1-2.

Responsible for a multitude of functions, kidneys are vital organs, yet Kidney Research UKs own research has found that 80% of people dont know where they are or what they do. The kidneys are located on either side of the spine, and they are responsible for hormone secretion into the bloodstream, removing waste, toxins and excess fluids from the blood. The term kidney disease encompasses a broad range of conditions that leads to poor kidney function. Since the kidneys are necessary for many bodily functions, kidney disease increases the risk of developing other diseases, and conversely other diseases are risk factors for kidney disease. There is no cure for kidney disease, and managing it is a complex task, as kidney abnormalities exist across every age group, gender and ethnicity and can appear without warning. Kidney disease is often labelled as a silent killer due to its frequent lack of physical symptoms, and as this report demonstrates is fast becoming a crisis. Even when symptoms are present, they are often overlooked or attributed to a differential diagnosis or other health issues. Since early diagnosis is key to managing and slowing progression to kidney failure, patients face devastating consequences if symptoms go undiagnosed. The majority of kidney diseases can be characterised as acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease or endstage kidney disease. Acute kidney injury is a rapid deterioration in kidney function and typically occurs in people who are hospitalised, especially those who require treatment in intensive care units. Acute kidney injury causes a build-up of waste products in the blood, affecting other organs such as the brain, heart, and lungs. Acute kidney injury requires most patients to be hospitalised for kidney function to recover and in most cases is reversible. However, it is recognised as an important risk factor for progression of chronic kidney disease.",
    "However, it is recognised as an important risk factor for progression of chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease is usually categorised into five stages (Table E1). 11 Table E1. Stages of chronic kidney disease Stages of chronic % of kidney Symptom/implication kidney disease function Kidney damage STAGE 1 with normal kidney function 100-90% People in early-stage chronic kidney disease may not know they have chronic kidney disease as they often feel well and show no symptoms Kidney damage STAGE 2 with mild loss of kidney function 89-60% Mild to moderate STAGE 3a loss of kidney function 59-45% People are often diagnosed with kidney Moderate to disease in the mid-stage, with many STAGE 3b severe loss of people still asymptomatic as waste in kidney function 44-30% the body builds and blood pressure rises Severe loss of STAGE 4 kidney function 29-15% Patients with kidney failure require dialysis or a kidney transplant to stay alive A proportion of people with kidney STAGE 5 Kidney failure failure will not receive either dialysis or transplant, instead undergoing Less than 15% conservative care Dialysis is a type of kidney replacementtherapythat replaces the blood-filtering function ofthe kidneys. Chronic kidney disease affects more than 10% of the UK population and is rapidly becoming more common as the population ages. Despite its high prevalence, early detection and awareness are low, in part because of an absence of early symptoms. Many health conditions can contribute to chronic kidney disease, but two primary risk factors are diabetes and high blood pressure. Diabetes and the accompanying high levels of blood sugar can damage various organs in the body, including the kidneys and heart. High blood pressure, or hypertension, damages blood vessels throughout the body, including those in the kidneys. When these blood vessels are damaged, the kidneys are less effective at removing waste and excess fluid from the body. 12 In addition to clinical risk factors, there are environmental and social factors that contribute to an increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease. These factors include access to healthcare, societal inequalities, and biological, genetic and cultural factors. Rare and genetic forms of kidney disease collectively affect a large number of people, while health inequalities make it challenging for people to receive the medical attention, access to care and support they need. In the UK, some groups are particularly at a disadvantage when it comes to kidney care. It is well established that people from lower socio-economic groups, in some instances ethnic minority groups, are more likely to develop chronic kidney disease, progress faster towards kidney failure and die earlier. People from some ethnic minority groups are three to five times more likely to require dialysis and wait much longer for a kidney transplant on average than people from a white background. Complications associated with kidney disease can accelerate progression and increase the risk of cardiovascular-related events. As chronic kidney disease worsens and becomes kidney failure (end-stage kidney disease), dialysis or kidney transplantation is required to survive. End-stage kidney disease is defined by permanent kidney damage, and kidney function is reduced to 15% or less. Patients may experience a variety of symptoms which include fatigue, drowsiness, reduction or absence of urine production, itchy skin, headache, weight loss, nausea, bone pain, skin and nail changes and easy bruising. This stage is ultimately fatal and requires either dialysis or a kidney transplant. The number of people with end-stage kidney disease requiring kidney replacement therapy is increasing worldwide and is predicted to double by 2030. To date in 2023, there are 30, 000 people in the UK who rely on dialysis to stay alive.",
    "To date in 2023, there are 30, 000 people in the UK who rely on dialysis to stay alive. There are two main types of dialysis to manage end-stage kidney disease haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. In the UK, the majority (72%) of the 7, 500 adults a year starting kidney replacement therapy begin with haemodialysis, where an artificial kidney machine is used to clean the blood. Most people receiving haemodialysis dialyse three times a week for four hours at a time. The other main form of dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, uses the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) to filter the blood. In 2020, around 3, 800 patients in the UK were on peritoneal dialysis. An alternative treatment for patients with kidney failure is a kidney transplant. In the UK, over 2, 900 adult transplants and 100 paediatric transplants are performed annually. For adult patients waiting for a kidney transplant, the average time frame is 2-3 years, with about 4, 600 patients on the waiting list in 2022. On average, a transplant from a deceased donor lasts 15-20 years and a transplant from a living donor around 20-25 years, with the longevity affected by a variety of factors including age, health and other multi-morbid risk factors including diabetes and cardiovascular complications. Despite the high prevalence and burden of kidney disease, research spending is relatively low, at just 1. 4% (17. 7 million) of relevant publicly funded research budgets in the financial year 2021/22. A systematic analysis of the economic burden of kidney disease has not been undertaken in the UK, since 2012. 13 Scope of this report Kidney Research UK commissioned ZS Associates to prepare a report investigating the following topics: The current kidney disease landscape in the UK, including acute, chronic and end-stage kidney disease, as well as rare and paediatric kidney diseases The current management strategies, risk factors, health of people from socially deprived communities, and the impact of Covid-19 on the kidney patient population The current incidence and prevalence of acute, chronic and end-stage kidney disease in the UK The current and projected (2033) economic burden of kidney disease, for both NHS and the wider UK economy Approach The diagram below shows the key steps taken to develop this report (Figure E1). Figure E1. Project approach 1. 30 contributing stakeholders with a 2. Targeted literature review of 11, 000 steering committee of ten UK articles from the last 5 years 3. Epidemiological modelling 4. Health economic modelling for chronic kidney disease using a population-level Markov model 14 1. Over 30 stakeholders contributed to the development of this report. Stakeholders were recruited from various backgrounds, including nephrologists, cardio-renal specialists, kidney transplant specialists, paediatric nephrologists, primary care physicians, nephrology clinical service directors, academics, data specialists and patients. Stakeholder engagement played a pivotal role in shaping the inputs of this report and validating the outputs. Stakeholder engagement began with a series of scoping meetings from December 2022 to January 2023. A smaller steering group of ten clinicians, academics and patients met regularly between February 2023 and April 2023 to guide the project and validate the key findings. 2. A targeted literature review was conducted to comprehensively gather the most up-to-date, publicly available evidence. The targeted literature review search strategy aligned with previously defined standards and was based on predefined reproducible search strings for epidemiology and economic literature reviews. The search identified approximately 11, 000 UK-based articles published in the last 5 years. In some cases, additional targeted searches were performed to find model parameters. Additional evidence was provided through stakeholders in the scoping meetings and steering committee meetings. 3.",
    "Additional evidence was provided through stakeholders in the scoping meetings and steering committee meetings. 3. The purpose of epidemiological modelling was to understand the historic trends in incidence and prevalence of the various conditions under the banner of kidney disease, and to calculate estimates of future demand and disease burden. The approach taken was to analyse several years of historic trends and changes in patient demographics. The modelling also examined the known impact of Covid-19 on these patient populations from 2020 to 2022. Because it is based on historical activity data, the projections from the epidemiological modelling will incorporate any existing capacity constraints they will not factor in any unmet need. This is a particular risk for projections of transplantation and dialysis as they may underestimate the true level of future need, and for that reason additional unconstrained projections were produced using the health economic model. 4. A population-level health economic model (Markov model) was used to estimate the current and future incidence/prevalence and economic burden of chronic kidney disease across all stages and show the directional impact of illustrative interventions based on costs and outcomes. The model was developed to capture both NHS (direct cost) and UK economy (wider economic cost) perspectives. The time horizon for the model was set to 10 years. In addition to this baseline, the model was used to estimate the impact of four potential public health interventions: earlier diagnosis, better adherence to clinical guidelines, increased uptake of new medicines and increased rates of transplantation. 15 Findings Epidemiology of kidney disease The prevalence of the various types and stages of kidney disease has grown considerably in recent years and will continue to do so. Factoring in the ageing population and excess deaths in high-risk populations during the Covid-19 pandemic, an estimated 7. 19 million people in the UK have chronic kidney disease in 2023, more than 10% of the UK population. By 2033, this will increase to 7. 61 million people. While the overall prevalence as a proportion of the age 16 population is expected to remain constant, among the people with chronic kidney disease, the proportion of patients with later-stage chronic kidney disease is expected to increase from 45% to 51% (Figure E2). Figure E2. Epidemiology of chronic kidney disease stages 1-5 (excluding transplantation and dialysis) Figure E2.

Based on historic trends, the incidence of acute kidney injury will increase from an estimated 615, 000 episodes in 2022 to 637, 000 by 2033. For dialysis and transplantation, a broad range of potential future demand was calculated. The constrained view assumes NHS capacity continues to grow at current rates based on the actual numbers of patients treated over the past 10 years, while the unconstrained view estimates the number of people who may need dialysis based on how quickly people progress through the stages of kidney disease. In the unconstrained view of demand, which factors in all potential unmet need, the number of patients requiring dialysis could rise to 143, 000, while the demand for transplantation could be as high as 12, 000 per year by 2033 (Figure E3).

Constrained vs. unconstrained projections of adults receiving kidney transplants in the UK (2033) Current and future economic burden of kidney disease In 2023, the total cost of kidney disease to the UK economy is estimated at 7. 0 billion. This includes 6. 4 billion in direct costs to the NHS, approximately 3. 2% of the 197 billion of total NHS spending across the four nations. The 7. 0 billion estimate also includes 372 million in productivity loss for people living with end-stage kidney disease and those who support them, in addition to 225 million of transport costs for patients receiving dialysis. With the assumption that the current system is at its maximum capacity for expensive end-stage kidney care such as dialysis and transplantation, the cost of kidney disease will rise to 7. 5 billion by 2033 (11% increase from 2023), with the biggest increase in cost due to the increasing prevalence and associated costs of chronic kidney disease stages 3-5. However, when modelling unconstrained need, the health economic model projected that in 2033 the cost could be as high as 13. 9 billion, with the biggest driver being the growth in demand for dialysis (Figure E4).

A key objective for this report was to assess whether a basket of potential population-level interventions for managing chronic kidney disease, including end-stage kidney disease, could be cost-saving or cost-effective. Through the stakeholder engagement process, several interventions were cited as having the potential to improve clinical outcomes associated with chronic kidney disease. The following interventions were applied to the model: Intervention 1. Early/improved diagnosis: This intervention targets underserved populations through outreach programmes to improve screening opportunities and increase early diagnosis and is illustrative of the benefits which can be achieved through well-targeted early/improved diagnosis in general. Intervention 2. Improved chronic kidney disease management: This intervention targets eligible patients with chronic kidney disease who are either untreated or not receiving standard care according to clinical guidelines (e. g. adequate blood pressure management). Intervention 3. Use of SGLT-2 inhibitors: This intervention aims to increase uptake of new medications such as sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors to reduce cardiovascular events and slow progression to end-stage kidney disease. Intervention 4. Increased rates of transplantation: This intervention models the impact of increased outreach and awareness to increase pre-emptive live donor transplants. It is illustrative of the benefits of improving transplantation rates more generally. The combined impact of these interventions was to prevent more than 10, 000 deaths over the 10-year time horizon, with 49, 574 quality-adjusted life years saved (Table E2).",
    "This is predicted to cost 7, 688 per quality-adjusted life years significantly below the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence willingness-to-pay threshold of 20, 000-30, 000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), meaning these interventions would be deemed cost effective. The modelling also predicts that the reduction in indirect costs (travel and lost economic productivity) of 445. 7 million would more than offset the total increase in NHS costs of 381. 1 million. All of the interventions individually or combined show a cost-effective or cost-saving Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) (Figure E5). 19 Table E2.

Chronic kidney disease affects 13% of the global population and is predicted to be the fifth leading cause of premature death by 2040. 2. In the UK, approximately 3. 25 million adults are living with chronic kidney disease stages 3-5, and a total of 7. 2 million adults have chronic kidney disease (all stages), more than 10% of the entire population. 3. By 2033, the number of people living with all-stage chronic kidney disease is projected to reach 7. 6 million. This is mainly driven by an ageing population as well as risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, as well as other important factors such as health and economic inequalities. 4. Amongst those with chronic kidney disease, the proportion with later-stage chronic kidney disease (3-5) is expected to increase from 45% (3. 25 million) to 51% (3. 9 million). 5. Around 615, 000 episodes of acute kidney injury occur each year, mainly among those who are already unwell or hospitalised for another reason. By 2033, the number of acute kidney injury episodes is projected to rise by 4% to 637, 000. 6. The total economic burden of kidney disease in the UK is 7. 0 billion, with 6. 4 billion attributable to direct costs to the NHS about 3. 2% of NHS budgets across the four nations. The total burden of kidney disease could rise to 13. 9 billion by 2033. 7. There is a further estimated 372 million in productivity loss to the UK economy from from missed work due to dialysis alone. Productivity loss in the UK could reach up to 2. 0 billion by 2033, as a higher proportion of patients continue living with end-stage kidney disease. 8. In 2023, the cost of dialysis for people with end-stage kidney disease is 1. 05 billion annually, or 0. 53% of the NHS budget.",
    "05 billion annually, or 0. 53% of the NHS budget. In addition to the direct cost of dialysis, transport for patients on in-centre dialysis costs approximately 225 million per year. The cost to the NHS of dialysis to manage kidney disease (per person) is 34, 000 per year more than three times the annual value of a state pension. 9. Despite its substantial and increasing cost to the NHS, and the urgent need for new and better treatments driven by research, kidney disease received only 1. 4% of relevant public healthcare research funding just 17. 7 million in financial year 2021/2022. 10. Economic modelling suggests that improved implementation of four illustrative healthcare interventions could save more than 10, 000 lives by 2033. These interventions individually and collectively are shown to be cost-effective or cost-saving, where costs to the NHS are offset by qualityadjusted life years gained. Premature death can be measured by life years lost, which takes into account frequency of death and age at which it occurs. It is calculated by multiplying the number of deaths by a global standard life expectancy at which death occurs. 21 Recommendations Strategic Modelling indicates that significant, cost-effective patient benefits can be achieved through better implementation of existing technologies and guidelines for the prevention, management and treatment of kidney disease. Across the health and care system, a national effort should be made to improve uptake of these interventions. Paediatric kidney disease is relatively rare and historically has not received the attention it deserves. Establishing some oversight of paediatric kidney care from kidney policymakers, in particular to establish better transition management for young adults, has been highlighted by stakeholders as important. The population with chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease is varied in terms of age, gender, ethnicity and the root causes of illness, and therefore the same diagnostic techniques, management strategies and treatments are not effective for all groups. For example, estimated glomerular filtration rate tests have been shown to be less sensitive at predicting outcomes in people who are of South Asian descent. There should be efforts made to personalise the care of patients with, or at risk of, kidney disease across the disease pathway. These should include: Use of the best possible diagnostic tests based on proven effectiveness for the demographics of the specific patient Genetic testing followed by appropriate management for those at risk of inherited kidney disease Patient choice in treatment, e. g. support with home dialysis for patients who feel this would better enable them to continue working and undertaking their usual activities Access to new and proven therapies to manage and slow disease progression in a timely manner Creating an environment fostering innovation and its implementation in real-world settings Kidney disease is complex and is intertwined with other chronic/serious health conditions. The NHS and voluntary sector organisations should seek to break down silos between organisations and teams working on kidney disease and related conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and inherited genetic conditions. Modelling suggests that more proactive engagement with people who are at risk or have kidney disease would be clinically and cost effective, e. g. : Peer engagement to improve adherence to disease management strategies Engaging in proactive discussions around living donor transplants Community outreach to engage underserved groups 22 However, given the frequent multi-morbidity of people with kidney disease, this engagement could be even more cost effective if it addressed multiple health conditions relevant to these populations at the same time. The NHS and voluntary sector should consider how to pool resources and efforts to collaborate across multiple programmes of engagement.",
    "The NHS and voluntary sector should consider how to pool resources and efforts to collaborate across multiple programmes of engagement. Current research funding for kidney disease is just 1. 4% of relevant healthcare budgets, while kidney disease represents 3. 2% of NHS budgets, with a risk of significant growth in this burden. Kidney disease research funding should be increased in line with the clinical and financial burden of disease. Clinical In this report, kidney disease has been referred to as a silent killer, because many patients are undiagnosed or asymptomatic until they reach a later stage of disease. Stakeholder interviews have revealed opportunities to improve adherence to best practice guidelines by making them simpler and more accessible, especially for primary care, where the huge breadth of conditions general practitioners treat is a challenge. In addition, measures should be taken to monitor local adherence to guidelines and intervene where necessary. To address barriers to implementation, focus is required on how best to provide knowledge transfer and pathway/process development. This could include closer collaboration between secondary and primary care, e. g. with regular virtual consultations between general practitioners and kidney specialists. A broader transformation of renal services is needed to improve care through standardisation and knowledge sharing. In England, the Renal Services Transformation Programme (RSTP) is currently reviewing adult renal services and recommending areas where improvements should be made. The recommendations for service improvement in the areas of early detection, dialysis and transplantation are in alignment with the findings of this report, which also addresses the scale of the challenge across the whole of the UK and the requirements of paediatric services to meet future needs. Severe kidney disease in children can have a similar impact in terms of mortality and lifelong disease to cancer. Because chronic kidney disease is a lifelong, gradually deteriorating condition, children with mild chronic kidney disease are likely to develop severe chronic kidney disease later in life, and therefore early intervention and ongoing management is important. Currently, however, poor infrastructure exists for children with kidney disease transitioning to adult services. Until recently, services were overseen nationally by a clinical reference group that included several other paediatric sub-specialties, which may be a cause for this disconnect. There is now a separate clinical reference group in place for paediatric renal services, and one of the focus areas should be establishing a more effective transition to adult services. 23 Research In the development of this report, several evidence gaps were identified, and further research should be considered to address them: Understanding the rate at which patients progress through the stages of chronic kidney disease is essential to predicting future demand for services. However, much of the data currently in the public domain is out of date, and up-to-date transition probabilities/relative risks of progression of chronic kidney disease for the whole population and subgroups are needed. Understanding the relative risk/rate of progression for undiagnosed populations is essential for assessing the cost effectiveness of early diagnosis and treatment interventions, but there is very little published literature relevant to the UK. Studies, potentially using real-world data, comparing the relative rates of progression in diagnosed vs undiagnosed populations are required. Sources such as the renal registries provide data on the numbers of patients receiving dialysis. However, there is limited data on unmet need or delays in meeting need, and as more patients progress to later-stage kidney disease, having real-time data which allows monitoring of any potential capacity pressures will become increasingly important. This report utilises evidence from other European countries to estimate the economic burden of kidney disease for the UK.",
    "This report utilises evidence from other European countries to estimate the economic burden of kidney disease for the UK. UK-specific studies on the impact of kidney disease on economic productivity are necessary. There is evidence of a strong and complex relationship between kidney disease and mental health. UK-specific studies on this relationship, including the impact of poor mental health on adherence to treatment, are needed. The evidence base relating to rare forms of kidney disease is scarce. Further research in this area is required to understand the natural history, determinants (including genetic), treatment effectiveness and burden of rare forms of kidney disease. Paediatric kidney disease is relatively rare and often complex. Better data and evidence are required to understand the needs of these patients, e. g. studies characterising their epidemiology, demographics and broader health needs. This report has highlighted the multitude of risk factors for kidney disease, but evidence on the causal link between diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease and other risk factors at a population level is scarce. Studies investigating the relationships between these conditions in a predictive manner would provide a powerful tool for population health planning. There are still large evidence gaps on how Covid-19 has affected and will continue to affect people with or at risk of kidney disease. At the time of writing this report, work in this area is ongoing using the OpenSAFELY platform, and it is important that it continues to be supported. There is an opportunity for the four nations of the UK to learn from each other on the management of kidney disease, but inconsistent data is a barrier to this. Introducing more consistent data, e. g. extending the Healthcare England Survey methodology to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, could be an important enabler for driving better health outcomes for the entire UK population. 24 Background Introduction: kidney disease, the silent crisis The kidneys are vital, life-sustaining organs, whose primary function is to filter the blood to remove wastes, poisons and excess fluid from the body. 1 The kidneys are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. 2 Each kidney is made up of units called nephrons, and their function is to remove waste while returning needed components back into the blood. 2 The kidneys are also responsible for controlling blood pressure, stimulating red blood cell production, keeping bones healthy, regulating blood chemicals and secreting essential hormones. 1, 2 When the kidneys are not working properly, harmful toxins and excess fluids build up in the body, which may lead to kidney failure. 3 These symptoms can include extreme tiredness or lethargy, persistent headaches, swelling in the face and ankles, fluid retention, lower back pain and death. 1 The term kidney disease encompasses a broad range of conditions that lead to issues with kidney function. 1, 2 Since the kidneys are vital to many bodily functions, kidney disease increases the risk of developing other diseases, and, conversely, other diseases are risk factors for kidney disease. 1, 2 There is no cure for the majority of kidney diseases, and managing them is a complex task as kidney abnormalities exist across every age group, gender and ethnicity and can occur without any warning, often without symptoms. 1, 2 Persistent and progressive damage to the kidneys leads to chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease). 4 chronic kidney disease is a major public health issue. It affects 13% of the global population and is predicted to be the fifth leading cause of life years lost (LYL) worldwide by the year 2040.",
    "5, 6 In 2016, the UK prevalence of all-stage chronic kidney disease was estimated at 12. 7% of the adult (16) population, and 5. 1% of the population had chronic kidney disease stages 3-5. 7 This data was based on a comprehensive population survey of the UK and includes both diagnosed and undiagnosed kidney diseases in the population. 7 chronic kidney disease is defined as abnormalities of either the kidney structure or its function that are present for more than 3 months. chronic kidney disease is a long-term condition in which kidney function declines over time, 1 and it is grouped and characterised into five stages (Table 1), each of which is associated with progressive damage. 8 As chronic kidney disease stages 1-2 are not well diagnosed or reported, the majority of patients are diagnosed between stages 3 and 5; however, there are many variables and risk factors that influence diagnosis, including age, gender, ethnicity and co-morbidities (e. g. diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease). 5 Life years lost is a measure of premature mortality which takes into account frequency of death and age at which it occurs. LYL is calculated by multiplying the number of deaths by a global standard life expectancy at which death occurs. 25 Table 1. Stages of chronic kidney disease Stages of chronic % of kidney Symptom/implication kidney disease function Kidney damage STAGE 1 with normal kidney function 100-90% People in early-stage chronic kidney disease may not know they have chronic kidney disease as they often feel well and show no symptoms Kidney damage STAGE 2 with mild loss of kidney function 89-60% Mild to moderate STAGE 3a loss of kidney function 59-45% People are often diagnosed with kidney Moderate to disease in the mid-stage, with many STAGE 3b severe loss of people still asymptomatic as waste in kidney function 44-30% the body builds and blood pressure rises Severe loss of STAGE 4 kidney function 29-15% Patients with kidney failure require dialysis or a kidney transplant to stay alive A proportion of people with kidney STAGE 5 Kidney failure failure will not receive either dialysis or transplant, instead undergoing Less than 15% conservative care Dialysis is a type of kidney replacementtherapythat replaces the blood-filtering function ofthe kidneys. In early-stage chronic kidney disease (stages 1-2), patients are often asymptomatic, but as the stage of chronic kidney disease increases, non-specific symptoms develop and include tiredness, nausea, sleep disturbance, more frequent urination (including at night) and muscle cramps. When kidney disease is advanced (chronic kidney disease stage 5) and kidney function is less than 15%, typically patients rely on dialysis or kidney transplantation where appropriate. Untreated kidney failure is fatal. 8 26 Detection and diagnosis of chronic kidney disease is a challenge. A 2020 study9 estimated that approximately half of people with chronic kidney disease were undiagnosed. Most people with chronic kidney disease are typically asymptomatic in the early and late stages and only diagnosed as a result of routine blood or urine tests, including those for other conditions, 10, 11 or once the disease has progressed. Uncoded chronic kidney disease, where the disease is not formally diagnosed, is associated with lower quality of care, as well as greater numbers of co-morbidities and adverse outcomes. 12 These estimates, from 2016, are likely to significantly underestimate the current and future burden of chronic kidney disease, since the prevalence of chronic kidney disease was much higher in the older population, e. g. the all-stage chronic kidney disease rate was 46% for the population aged 75 years or older.",
    "7 This means that as the UKs population is ageing, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease is also increasing. Estimates of current prevalence along with projections to 2033 are provided later in this report. These dual challenges of increasing prevalence and low detection are the reason kidney disease can be considered a silent crisis. Without detection and treatment, kidney disease progresses more rapidly to end stage (end-stage kidney disease), at which point the burden on the individual, the National Health Service (NHS) and the UK economy increases significantly. When on haemodialysis, patients will spend several hours a week receiving treatment, preventing them from participating in their usual activities and reducing their ability to work. A year of in-centre haemodialysis has previously been estimated to cost the NHS approximately 30, 000 per patient. 13 Productivity losses due to dialysis are not well characterised in the UK, but assuming similar losses to those observed in other European countries, patients and the people who support them will on average lose 20 days of work per year, an estimated cost to the economy of 2, 940 per person per year. 14 This average is relatively low, since most patients on dialysis are of retirement age, 13 although there are some dialysis patients of working age (55 years and younger), in particular many using home dialysis. Assuming similar losses to other European countries, employed people on dialysis on average will miss 30 days of work due to absenteeism and will lose an additional 56 days of work due to presenteeism (showing up to work but lacking productivity due to illness). 14 In total, the productivity loss per annum for an employed person on dialysis is estimated to cost the economy approximately 12, 600, 14 and many people on dialysis are unable to work at all. A Dutch study estimated that only 20% of people on dialysis were in full employment. 14 In addition, a person caring for a loved one on dialysis provides on average 9 hours of informal care per week, equivalent to an additional 9, 200 in lost productivity per year. 14 27 Kidney disease policy and research Despite its high prevalence and burden, kidney disease has not received the same level of priority as other long-term conditions. The 2019 NHS Long Term Plan called out the need for better care of other major health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and stroke but was silent on kidney disease. 15 Paediatric kidney disease populations are often neglected from a policy perspective due to small patient numbers and the complexity of the disease in children, since they do not fall under the same national leadership structures as the adult population with kidney disease. This can result in a lack of focus and structure, in which case, some challenges surrounding the paediatric kidney population might not be clearly understood. 16 The last significant review describing the burden of kidney disease in the UK (which focused on England) was published in 2012. This review was focused on estimates based on 2010 NHS data. 17 The financial burden of chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease estimated by that report was 1. 45bn (1. 3% of NHS budgets) and is still used in policy documents despite the increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease due to the ageing population, the impact of additional risk factors and increasing costs to the NHS. 17-19 Research funding for kidney disease is also disproportionately low compared with the current economic burden. As set out below (Table 2), kidney disease received only 1.",
    "As set out below (Table 2), kidney disease received only 1. 4% of relevant public sector research budgets in 2021-2022, in line with the cost to the NHS of chronic kidney disease in 2010, but likely far below the equivalent share of the current economic burden of kidney disease in 2023, estimated at 3. 2% of the total NHS budget in this report.

It has a broader scope than the 2012 report, as it covers multiple types of kidney disease: chronic kidney disease Acute kidney injury (acute kidney injury) end-stage kidney disease Rare kidney diseases Paediatric kidney disease It also takes a broader perspective on economic burden, measuring this in terms of both cost to the NHS and cost to the wider economy. The following sections of this report cover: A more detailed overview of each group of patients with kidney disease Risk factors and inequalities The epidemiology (incidence and prevalence) of kidney disease in the UK, now and projected to 2033 The economic burden of kidney disease, for both the NHS and the wider economy, now and projected to 2033 Interventions to reduce this burden, with a focus on chronic kidney disease Recommendations 29 Overview of kidney disease Chronic kidney disease chronic kidney disease is a progressive condition and is usually asymptomatic in the early stages. For kidney disease to be considered chronic, damage must be evident for at least 3 months. 20 As the disease progresses, the kidneys become increasingly damaged, leading to a range of symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, difficulty concentrating and loss of appetite. In advanced stages of chronic kidney disease, patients may experience serious complications such as high blood pressure, anaemia, bone disease, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease). Over time, chronic kidney disease can cause renal dysfunction and progression to end-stage kidney disease. 21 Detection and diagnosis of chronic kidney disease at early stages is crucial, as the right treatment can slow disease progression and prevent complications. chronic kidney disease stages are traditionally categorised based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate; G categories, G1-G5), which is a measure of how well the kidneys filter the blood. The risk of progression is assessed based on a combination of estimated glomerular filtration rate and presence of the protein albumin (albuminuria; A categories, A1-A3). 20 As per the table below (Table 3)8, risk level is scored between 1 and 4, and this score helps determine the method and intensity of monitoring and treatment of patients. As these scores increase, so does the risk of chronic kidney disease progression, death from all causes, cardiovascular death and acute kidney injury. 20 30 Table 3.",

In England, this is equivalent to about 340, 000 people. 24 Acute kidney injury acute kidney injury is a common health problem, 28 typically occurring in patients who are hospitalised, especially those who require treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU). 29 acute kidney injury is characterised by an abrupt loss of kidney function and is strongly associated with high morbidity and mortality. 30 acute kidney injury is complex due to multiple risk factors, including age, heart failure, liver failure, chronic kidney disease, anaemia and exposure to nephrotoxic agents such as antibiotics. 29 Patients who experience acute kidney injury are at higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease in the future.",
    "29 Patients who experience acute kidney injury are at higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease in the future. 31 In one study, chronic kidney disease developed in approximately 25% of hospitalised patients with acute kidney injury after 3 years. 32 acute kidney injury is associated with poor patient outcomes, increased length of hospital stay and high mortality. 3 1 Based on a national study in the UK, up to 30% of deaths attributed to acute kidney injury could have been prevented with early recognition and treatment. 31 A significant proportion of patients with acute kidney injury require management in a hospital setting, which involves fluid resuscitation, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and correction of electrolyte imbalances. 33 Optimal management of acute kidney injury requires close collaboration with a multi-disciplinary team including primary care physicians, nephrologists, allied health professionals and other subspecialists participating in the care of the patient. 33 32 End-stage kidney disease In end-stage kidney disease, permanent kidney damage has occurred to the point where the kidneys are unable to support life. 34 Patients may experience a wide variety of symptoms, including fatigue, drowsiness, decrease in urination or inability to urinate, dry skin, itchy skin, headache, weight loss, nausea, bone pain, skin and nail changes and easy bruising. This stage is ultimately fatal and requires either dialysis a kidney replacement therapy that replaces the normal blood filtering function of the kidneys or a kidney transplant. Currently, there are 30, 000 people in the UK who rely on dialysis to stay alive, 34 and every year, around 3, 000 people receive a kidney transplant. 35 The number of people with end-stage kidney disease requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT) has been increasing worldwide and is predicted to double by 2030. 36 Management: dialysis Two major types of dialysis exist to manage end-stage kidney disease haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. 37 In the UK, the majority (72%) of the 7, 500 adults a year starting KRT begin with haemodialysis, where an artificial kidney machine is used to clean the blood. 38 The average number of sessions for a patient on haemodialysis is three times a week, for an average of 4 hours per session, both at home and in-centre. 39 In 2019, cost estimates for in-centre haemodialysis were approximately 30, 000, 13 representing a huge cost burden to the NHS and a huge impact on patients lives. 34 Beyond allowing greater flexibility in a patients schedule, as they can dialyse overnight, homebased haemodialysis was significantly cheaper, with an annual estimate of over 20, 000 compared with in-centre dialysis, 13 and these more regular sessions at home can lower restrictions on dietary and fluid consumption. 40 In 2020, 1, 400 patients were on home-based haemodialysis. 34 The second form of dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, uses the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) to filter the blood through a daily routine at home. 40 Around 3, 800 patients in the UK were on peritoneal dialysis in 2020. 34 Peritoneal dialysis is classified into two types: continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, which uses a portable machine for at least 2 hours a day, and automated peritoneal dialysis, which uses a home-based machine overnight. 40 Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) is a term used to encompass treatments used for kidney failure. These treatments include dialysis and transplantation. 33 Management: transplantation In the UK, over 2, 900 adult kidney transplants and 100 paediatric kidney transplants are performed annually. 3 5 For adult patients waiting for a kidney transplant, the average time frame is 2-3 years, with about 4, 600 active patients on the waiting list in 2022.",
    "35 For patients, the typical time frame from when they start on dialysis to transplantation is on average 3 years. 35 Among those on the waiting list, some receive a transplant, but others die waiting or are removed, typically from becoming too unwell for transplantation (Figure 1). 35, 41 The majority of adult transplant recipients (70%) receive deceased donor kidneys, while the opposite is true for children the majority (65%) receive living donor kidneys. 35 Patient survival at 5 years is 88% for adult patients who received deceased donor kidneys and 94-95% for adult patients who received living donor kidneys. 34, 35 On average, deceased donor kidneys last 15-20 years, while living donor kidneys last 20-25 years. 35 Figure 1.

Because conservative care is more focused on maintaining remaining kidney function and preventing or treating symptoms, cost to the NHS is substantially lower than dialysis (on average 5, 600 for conservative care compared to the 15, 000 for dialysis). 43 Conservative care can also be less burdensome than dialysis for carers. When looking at the carer experience and caregiver quality of life (QoL), carers for patients on conservative care rate their experience higher than those caring for patients on dialysis (15 points higher on a 100-point scale). QoL is a concept which aims to capture the well-being, whether of a population or individual, regarding both positive and negative elements.",
    "For example, common facets of QoL include personal health (physical, mental, and spiritual), relationships, education status, work environment, social status, wealth, a sense of security and safety, freedom, autonomy in decision-making, social-belonging, and their physical surroundings. 47 Fatigue and mental health scores were worse for dialysis carers than conservative carers, but both had low scores for assistance from organisations and government. 48 35 Rare kidney diseases Rare kidney diseases encompass at least 150 different conditions, most of which are inherited. 49 Although individual rare kidney diseases raise specific issues, as a group these rare diseases can present challenges in differential diagnosis, which include small numbers of affected patients, unidentified causes of disease, lack of biomarkers for monitoring disease progression, and need for complex care. 50 Patients often spend years visiting multiple healthcare providers before receiving an accurate diagnosis. 50 In the UK, according to the UK Kidney Association (UKKA) there are 20 rare renal conditions that are well characterised and diagnosed (Table 4). 5 1 Table 4.",
    "This can lead to kidney stones, affecting 1 in 1 million people (men and women are affected equally) Symptoms include blood in the urine, reduced growth, Primary Hyperoxaluria anaemia and severe pain in the stomach or back (PH, also known as Diagnosis is often delayed as the condition is so rare.

Kidney disease in children can be caused by birth defects, hereditary diseases, infection and systemic disease. 52-56 Alongside chronic kidney disease disease complications seen at any age, such as anaemia, high blood pressure and mineral bone disorder, chronic kidney disease can affect growth in children. Beyond clinical complications, children with advanced chronic kidney disease lose many hours of education through hospital attendances and illness and have a greater incidence of problems relating to behaviour, relationships and self-esteem. 57 Treatment decisions can be complicated by the rarity of the paediatric kidney disease, meaning there are few specialist centres to help manage the complexity of these diseases in the paediatric patient population. In the UK, there are approximately 1, 000 children living with chronic kidney disease. 58 Management Managing kidney disease in children is particularly challenging. Developing best practices for the management of paediatric kidney diseases is complicated due to a limited number of studies, which are often single centre or reflect a selected cohort of children with access to specialist care. 59 Some children with end-stage kidney disease may need dialysis if they present late or are unsuitable for pre-emptive transplantation for medical or psychosocial reasons, but for virtually all children, the ultimate aim is kidney transplantation.",
    "Children with kidney disease currently have an average waiting time (including dialysis and suspension) of 2 years for a kidney transplant, based on children who were first put onto the national kidney transplant waiting list between April 2015 and March 2019. 60 In general, the care of children with kidney disease requires a multidisciplinary approach to a much greater extent than adult care (Table 5). 5 7, 61 41 Table 5.

Help young people develop skills and support them in building their confidence and self-esteem, which can so often be a problem. 42 Risk factors Clinical risk factors for kidney disease chronic kidney disease is associated with a range of co-morbid conditions, particularly, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. 1 8, 19 These conditions are closely linked, with each one contributing to the development and progression of chronic kidney disease. Risk of death in people with chronic kidney disease rises exponentially as kidney function deteriorates, largely attributable to cardiovascular disease. 62 Some studies have suggested that diabetes and hypertension are the leading causes of chronic kidney disease and are risk factors for the progression of both chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. 62 Targeting modifiable risk factors can therefore improve survival and quality of life by reducing cardiovascular disease in those with chronic kidney disease and slowing progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage kidney disease. 62 Diabetes Figure 2.

    "18 Diabetes damages the blood vessels in the kidneys and impairs their function, leading to the development and progression of chronic kidney disease. 18, 63 Diabetes is also a leading cause of end-stage kidney disease. 18 Almost one in three people who need dialysis or a transplant have diabetes, and one in five people with diabetes will need treatment for kidney disease during their lifetime. 64 In the UK, the prevalence of diabetes varies across the four nations, England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland over a six year period (Figure 2). 6 5 Management Early screening and detection is important, as diabetes is a risk factor for developing chronic kidney disease and requires early treatment, which can stop or slow disease progression. SGLT-2 inhibitors are commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes in patients with chronic kidney disease, as they have shown positive effects on diabetic kidney disease in clinical trials. 66 Hypertension Blood pressure is the force of the blood against the walls of blood vessels as the heart pumps blood around the body. If this pressure becomes too high, patients typically are diagnosed with high blood pressure, or hypertension. Hypertension is a major risk factor for the development and progression of chronic kidney disease, and it is also a common consequence of cardiovascular disease, leading towards end-stage kidney disease. 67, 68 Hypertension can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys, leading to reduced blood flow and impaired kidney function. 67 Management Hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease can be managed through a combination of lifestyle interventions, including diet modification, and pharmacological interventions. 69 Based on NICE guidelines, calcium-channel blockers are recommended as first-line pharmacological therapy to manage hypertension and also have a demonstrated effect on reducing proteinuria (protein levels in the urine), a key component of chronic kidney disease. ACEs and ARBs are recommended for those with proteinuria. 69 Management and monitoring of blood pressure is important for reducing chronic kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events such as heart attack or stroke. Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease is a general term for conditions affecting the heart or blood vessels. cardiovascular disease is the most common co-morbidity associated with chronic kidney disease, and it is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease. 19 Patients with chronic kidney disease have an elevated risk for cardiovascular events; 50% of all patients with chronic kidney disease stages 4-5 have cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular mortality accounts for approximately 40% to 50% of all deaths in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (stage 4) as well as end-stage kidney disease (stage 5), compared with 26% in controls with normal kidney function. 63 People 44 with chronic kidney disease are at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and those with established cardiovascular disease are at increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease. 19 The reasons for this overlap are complex and not fully understood, but it is believed that shared risk factors such as diabetes, inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction all play a role in the development and progression of both chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. Management Control of traditional risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia (also known as high cholesterol), is essential to reduce cardiovascular disease. The substantial morbidity and mortality from coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease make the effective management of cardiovascular disease critical. 70 Risk factors for cardiovascular disease and acute cardiovascular events can be managed in patients with chronic kidney disease through lifestyle modification and drugs such as ACEs and ARBs.",
    "18, 71 SGLT-2 inhibitors have also shown beneficial effects in reducing cardiovascular events such as heart failure, stroke and heart attack in patients with chronic kidney disease. 26, 71, 72 Multi-morbidity Patients with kidney disease often have more than one co-morbidity, including diabetes, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, anaemia and malnutrition. 23 The presence of these co-morbidities can complicate the management of chronic kidney disease and make it more difficult to slow or stop the progression of the disease. Patients with co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes are at increased risk of acute kidney injury, particularly if they have pre-existing chronic kidney disease. . 70 The management of acute kidney injury in patients with co-morbidities can be complex, and it requires a coordinated approach that takes into account the patients underlying conditions. 73 Treatment may involve addressing the underlying cause of the acute kidney injury, such as dehydration or medication toxicity, as well as managing the patients co-morbidities to prevent further damage to the kidneys. 33, 74 In some cases, patients may require dialysis to support their kidney function and prevent further complications. In addition, these co-morbidities can increase the risk of complications such as heart attack, stroke and infections, particularly in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease. 70 Kidney disease and mental health While a number of other health conditions are risk factors for chronic kidney disease, long-term conditions (including chronic kidney disease) are associated with a greater risk of mental health problems and cognitive impairment. For example, patients who have both chronic kidney disease and diabetes have a two-fold increase in the rate of cognitive disorders when compared with patients who do not have diabetes or chronic kidney disease. 75-77 Mental health problems are associated with a much greater cost to the health service. 76 For example, the NHS, in England alone, spends 8-13 billion per annum on comorbid mental health problems in patients with chronic disease. 76 Those with long-term conditions are two to three times more likely to experience mental health problems, which is associated with high socio-economic deprivation. 76 Beyond the problems associated with their management, co-morbid mental health problems are associated with poorer clinical outcomes, a lower quality of life, and reduced ability to manage physical symptoms. 76 45 Kidney disease has a significant negative impact on the quality of life and mental health of children and young people. 78-82 This impact is seen across their emotional, social, physical and educational well-being and functioning. 83-85 Additionally, as in adults, there is evidence that psychosocial issues have a negative impact on the medical outcomes of children and young people. 86, 87 Demographic and inequality risk factors In addition to clinical risk factors, there are environmental and social factors that contribute to an increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease and poor chronic kidney disease outcomes. These factors include access to care, social inequalities and biological factors; biological factors include socio-demographic, biological, genetic and cultural factors. 10, 11 Health inequalities make it challenging for people to receive the medical attention, access to care and support they need. 10, 11 In the UK, some groups are particularly at a disadvantage when it comes to kidney care. 10 It is well established that people from lower socio-economic groups and people from ethnic minority groups (previously referred to as Black, Asian and minority ethnic BAME in a previous study) are more likely to develop chronic kidney disease, progress faster towards kidney failure and die earlier with chronic kidney disease.",
    "10, 11 As the UK population as a whole grows older, the demographics within it are changing. 88 Today, most ethnic minorities have younger populations than the majority white British population; however, by 2051, those ethnic groups, particularly, South Asian, will have the highest proportion of people aged 50 and older, shifting the demographics and needs of patients. 88 Age and frailty Kidney disease can develop at any time, but older people are at greater risk due to risk factors that increase with age. 58 Based on 2016 data, 12% of adults aged 65-74 were diagnosed and staged with chronic kidney disease. 7 In the 2016 Health Survey for England (HSE), 34% of adults aged 75 or older had chronic kidney disease stages 3-5. 7 Frailty, a syndrome of physiological decline, is associated with an increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes and annually costs the UK 5. 8 billion. 89 Patients with chronic kidney disease are more frail than the general population because they lose biological reserves and become more vulnerable to conditions such as inflammation, physical inactivity, reduced energy intake and metabolic acidosis. 89 Estimating frailty prevalence in chronic kidney disease is challenging because of the different criteria used in each study. 8 9 There are studies that demonstrate the association between frailty trajectories and cardiovascular, kidney and mortality outcomes in chronic kidney disease, 89 showing that frailty is associated with increased mortality and rate of dialysis in patients and suggesting that patients who are more frail have an increased rate of requiring dialysis. 89 Ethnic inequalities Individuals of Black and Asian descent are more likely to progress faster towards kidney failure and are less likely than white people to receive a kidney transplant. 10, 11 These communities are also disproportionately affected by inequalities in transplant services in the UK, as they are at greater risk of developing organ failure, are less likely to be organ donors and wait longer 46 for transplants. 90 Thirty-five percent of patients waiting for a kidney are from ethnic minority groups, while only 7. 2% of people from these communities are on the NHS organ donor register. 10, 11 Investigating inequalities in kidney care and their impact on these communities is not only necessary for reducing inequalities in the UK but also likely to improve the understanding of access to care barriers for other groups with end-stage kidney disease globally, as well. 91 estimated glomerular filtration rate is a measure of kidney function and has been used to predict outcomes with varied success. 92 For patients of European descent, estimated glomerular filtration rate is inversely related to mortality and cardiovascular disease but is not a good predictor of outcomes in South Asians with similar estimated glomerular filtration rate levels. 10, 11 Albumin-to-creatinine ratio (albumin-creatinine ratio) has been suggested to be more predictive of outcomes in South Asians than estimated glomerular filtration rate 92, as high levels of albumin-creatinine ratio was correlated with the increased rates of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular death in South Asian ethnic patients. 92 Gender inequality acute kidney injury is more common in men than women after accounting for socio-economic status, ethnicity, alcohol intake and smoking history. 9 3-95 This contrasts with current guidelines and clinical scoring systems which place a higher risk on females, mostly based on older, smaller observational studies. 93 Economic inequality Socio-economic deprivation is a measure of individual and area indicators that may have a direct link to healthcare and outcomes, often correlated with poor survival outcomes.",
    "Patients with chronic kidney disease who are socio-economically deprived have faster rates of disease progression, higher risk of cardiovascular disease and premature mortality. 96 Patients with chronic kidney disease and an annual income of 12, 500 had a two-fold increased risk of having adverse cardiovascular outcomes compared with patients with chronic kidney disease who had a higher income. 96 Socio-economic deprivation is also associated with an increased length of time on the transplant waiting list 97, 95 and more limited access to living donor transplants, leading to higher rates of mortality and long-term kidney failure. 94 Analysis of survival post-transplant also showed that deprivation was associated with increased mortality at 1 and 5 years post-transplant, and patients from deprived areas were less likely to have a functioning transplant at 5 years. 97 Patients in the UK living with kidney disease also report that the cost of living impacts both their physical and mental health. 98, 99 Just as economic circumstances can impact kidney disease, living with kidney disease can negatively impact individuals financial wellbeing. Increasing costs are driving patients to choose between food, electricity and their health. 98, 99 Managing kidney health often requires special diets that can increase food costs, which are further impacted by inflation, and therefore more likely to affect people from low-income households or who are economically inactive. 98 Since chronic kidney disease is known as a silent disease, most patients only treat symptoms when they arise and may neglect daily maintenance of risk factors such as diabetes or hypertension that may prevent progression of kidney disease. 16 47 Transport costs can also be a barrier to patients receiving treatment. Recently, the cost of travel to appointments has been a focus for the NHS, and as of May 2022, transport eligibility for people on dialysis was confirmed for incentre dialysis in England; however, there are variations in policies around the UK that impact reimbursement of health-associated travel. 98 As with other paediatric conditions, kidney disease can create severe financial hardship for children and their families. Out-of-pocket expenses such as transportation (travel and parking for appointments), food and drink, and household bills can all be increased. Additionally, a critically ill child may mean that one or both parents are unable to work, or are working less to care for the child, putting a further strain on household finances and impacting the wider UK economy. 98 Health literacy Health literacy is the degree to which individuals have the ability to find, understand and use information and services to inform health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others. 100, 101 Health literacy, often associated with other inequalities, can also have an impact on health outcomes. In the UK, approximately 80% of people did not know the location or the function of the kidneys. 102 More than half believe, incorrectly, that kidney transplants last a lifetime and are a cure for kidney disease. 102 In the general public, these inaccurate assumptions lead to reduced uptake of prevention services and adherence to medical advice, which may lead to increased morbidity and mortality. 101 A systematic review found that people with lower literacy had less appropriate patterns of health service use and were not always able to secure appropriate treatment. 101, 103 When compared with people with adequate health literacy, people with limited health literacy generally enter the health system when they are sicker. 101 Twenty-five percent of people with chronic kidney disease have limited health literacy, and this disproportionally affects ethnic minorities and other underserved communities.",
    "104 Covid-19associated risk factors The Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on kidney disease, through: Creating new incidence of kidney disease Disrupting the care of people with existing kidney disease Increasing mortality for people with kidney disease Delaying/reducing the diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (due to testing not taking place) Kidney disease incidence and Covid-19 Covid-19 patients had a high risk of developing acute kidney injury, and those who did were more likely to become critically ill. Hospitalised patients with Covid-19 had a one in four chance of developing early acute kidney injury and a further 8% chance of developing late acute kidney injury. 105-107 Early acute kidney injury was defined by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) creatinine criteria within 7 days of admission, and late acute kidney injury was defined as acute kidney injury occurring only after day 7. 107 The risk factors for developing acute kidney injury during a Covid-19 infection were similar to those for pre-pandemic acute kidney injury, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and multi48 morbidity. 107, 108 In turn, patients with acute kidney injury had an ICU admission rate of 39. 4% as compared to 18. 4% for those without acute kidney injury. 109 In the ICU, acute kidney injury and renal impairment were associated with an increased need of respiratory support and mechanical ventilation for critical disease. 107, 109, 110 Retrospective studies have also associated increased risk of developing acute kidney injury during hospital admission for Covid-19 in ethnic minority groups (previously referred to as BAME), potentially further demonstrating inequities in those communities as noted above. 105-107 Beyond developing acute kidney injury, patients with Asian ethnicity were found to have a higher rate of persistent acute kidney injury or relapsing acute kidney injury while hospitalised. 107 The risk of developing chronic kidney disease was also high in patients hospitalised with Covid-19 particularly if they did not recover kidney function by discharge 44. 8% of patients who had not recovered kidney function developed chronic kidney disease, as compared to 10. 1% who had. 106 Disruption to kidney services and Covid-19 During the pandemic, the UK was forced to rapidly evolve existing care models in preparation for significant front-line service pressures, 111 and this created a number of dilemmas, contributing to poor outcomes in patients with kidney disease. 112 A suspension of all non-urgent elective surgery to create hospital capacity for Covid-19related activity meant most UK transplant centres suspended kidney transplant activity, 111 although there were geographic variations across the UK based on the availability of ICU capacity and emergency personnel. 111 Mortality in Covid-19 patients during the pandemic Renal impairment in the ICU was correlated with increased requirement of KRT, which was further associated with increased mortality. 110 The mortality rate was 2030% in kidney transplant recipients during the first wave of the pandemic, with a reduction in mortality during the second wave113 and a disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups and socio-economically disadvantaged individuals. 112 Although living donation came to a nearly complete stop early on during the pandemic, it has resumed since then but does not appear to have reached pre-pandemic levels. 112 Patients on dialysis were amongst those at highest risk of death, not just because of the propensity for serious illness but also because of missed treatments. 114 Data from universal screening of a single dialysis unit in the UK showed that patients experienced a spike in infection following a spike in infection of health care workers, implying potential transmission from health care worker to patient.",
    "114, 115 Overall, patients with chronic kidney disease experienced significant excess mortality during the Covid-19 pandemic. 116 A retrospective analysis of data in England found that there were 34, 000 observed excess deaths in the chronic kidney disease population from March 2020 to March 2021. 116 49 Limitations and ongoing research In the modelling process, significant gaps were found in the evidence base, specifically the relationship between Covid-19 and kidney disease, e. g. uncertainties regarding the incidence of Covid-19 infections in the chronic kidney disease prevalent population and the impact of Covid-19 on the paediatric kidney disease population. At the time of writing, there is ongoing research investigating the impacts of Covid-19 on kidney disease, in particular work utilising the OpenSAFELY database, which covers the primary care records of about 24 million patients in England. This data was not included in this report. A limitation of current research is that it often does not take a systematic approach (e. g. there is a need to consider patient outcomes, patient experiences, workforce capacity and capability, as well as inclusion/diversity of research participation). 117 50 Methodology Overview of approach The ambitious scope of this report necessitates a multifaceted methodology, with elements of evidence synthesis and modelling (Figure 3). It has been underpinned by broad stakeholder engagement from the outset. Early engagement was undertaken via workshops with expert clinicians, academics, data experts within the field of kidney disease and patient representatives. A subset of these stakeholders was subsequently consulted on a regular basis as part of a project steering group to review and challenge preliminary and final project outputs, suggest refinements and provide subject matter expertise. Representatives from industry were also convened to provide insights into innovations which other stakeholders may not yet be aware of and challenges they face in bringing them to market. Input from additional experts was sought where particular gaps or uncertainties in the data emerged. A targeted literature review (TLR) of economic and epidemiological research related to kidney disease in the UK was undertaken. It focused on literature published over the last 5 years, including published systematic literature reviews (SLRs) and TLRs which summarised older evidence. Outputs from the TLR were combined with additional data and grey literature, e. g. from government websites, where required. These were the key inputs to epidemiological and health economic (cost-effectiveness) modelling. The epidemiological modelling focused on understanding the current number of people with chronic kidney disease, dialysis, transplantation and acute kidney injury and the associated costs. These were projected forward to 2033. The health economic model focused on the chronic kidney disease pathway, understanding the costs and outcomes associated with the current state of clinical care, and testing the impact and cost-effectiveness of potential interventions at a population level. Included interventions were chosen based on recommendations from stakeholders and availability of evidence. Figure 3. Diagram of flowchart methodology Figure 3.

Not all of these metrics could be calculated for all types and stages of kidney disease. The availability of outputs is summarised in the table below (Table 6). Table 6.",

Paediatric kidney disease outputs only related to transplantation and dialysis in paediatric kidney disease. 52 Detailed method: stakeholder engagement Stakeholder engagement played a pivotal role in shaping the inputs of this report and validating the outputs. Given the complexity of kidney disease, it was essential to engage a range of stakeholders across the care pathway. The stakeholders helped to shape the areas of focus for the TLR, identifying key evidence, providing updates on ongoing unpublished research and reviewing the modelling and report itself (Figure 4). For the modelling, where published literature did not exist, stakeholders provided rationale for assumptions based on clinical practice and experience. Figure 4. Diagram of stakeholder engagement process Scoping meetings Steering Group (December 2022 - January 2023) (February - April 2023) Who: Thirty stakeholders including Who: Ten stakeholders from scoping patients, senior NHS clinicians and UK meetings including patients, senior NHS academics. clinicians, and UK academics. Objectives: Understand the current and Objective: Validate modelling, including future care of people with kidney diseases, approach, assumptions and outcomes. identify priority topics for the targeted literature review, and advise on key elements for this report. In total, 30 stakeholders were involved in the project, including senior NHS clinicians, academic professors, general practitioners, and senior academics in kidney disease (many of whom were also clinicians), who were consulted on data availability, modelling assumptions and ongoing research. These included: Secondary care nephrology Cardio-renal Kidney transplantation Paediatric nephrology Primary care Nephrology clinical service directors Epidemiologists Registry operators (e. g. Scottish Renal Registry, UK Renal Registry and OpenSAFELY) Public health specialists Health inequalities specialists Patient representatives with kidney disease were also consulted through this project 53 Stakeholder engagement began with a series of scoping meetings from December 2022 to January 2023. A smaller steering group of ten with clinicians, academics and patients met regularly between February 2023 and April 2023 to guide the project and validate the key findings. With clinicians and patients, the objectives of these scoping meetings were to understand the current state and future state of care for people with kidney disease in the UK: this included probes on clinical guidelines, changing epidemiology and patient demographics, opportunities for innovation, and evidence gaps which could be addressed in this report or future research. With academics and data specialists, the focus was on identifying, interpreting and understanding the limitations of data sets currently available in the public domain. Meetings with the steering group focused on refining the modelling approach, defining the key interventions for the cost-effectiveness model and pressure testing the outputs contained within this report. In total, the steering group met three times from February to April 2023. This was supplemented by ad hoc meetings with individual steering group members.",
    "This was supplemented by ad hoc meetings with individual steering group members. In addition to the above, on three occasions, the project team met with Kidney Research UK industry affiliates, life science companies focused on kidney health to provide their perspectives on advancements in treatments for people with kidney disease. They also provided insights on research and operational challenges their organisations faced with regards to their pipeline therapeutics for kidney disease in the UK. 54 Detailed method: targeted literature review The TLR was conducted as a comprehensive way to gather the most up-todate, publicly available evidence to inform this report. The TLR informed the content in this report as well as provided evidence for the epidemiology and cost-effectiveness models. The TLR search strategy aligned with standards developed by the Centre of Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York and was based on predefined reproducible search strings for epidemiology and economic literature reviews. The stakeholder engagement scoping meetings helped refine the search string. Search eligibility criteria followed the population, interventions, comparators, outcomes, timeframe and study design (PICOTS) framework as per Cochrane guidelines (Appendix A). This search strategy covered acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, end-stage kidney disease and other rare and inherited kidney diseases. It included epidemiological evidence from cohort studies, cross-sectional studies and registry studies and economic evidence that reported cost and resource use. The search identified approximately 11, 000 UK-based articles, published in the last 5 years, on the epidemiology and economic impact of kidney disease (Figure 5). Articles were screened in two rounds: first pass title and abstract review, second pass full text review. 55 Identification of studies via databases and registers Identification of studies via other methods 56 noitacfiitnedI gnineercS dedulcnI Figure 5.

These additional searches used articles outside of the original search criteria (e. g. articles from before 2017). Detailed method: epidemiological modelling The purpose of epidemiological modelling is to understand the historic trends in prevalence and incidence in the various conditions under the banner of kidney disease, to calculate estimates of future demand and disease burden. The approach taken was to analyse several years of historic trends and changes in patient age demographics to project the burden of chronic kidney disease stages 3-5, transplantation, dialysis and acute kidney injury from 2023 to 2033. It also examines the known impact Covid-19 has had on these patient populations from 2020 to 2022 (chronic kidney disease stages 1-2 were projected using the health economic modelling approach only, due to constraints of the data, as set out below). The epidemiological model uses historical incidence rates of dialysis and transplantation to project rates for 2033. Historical rates have been relatively flat over the last 10 years, indicating that current capacity for dialysis and transplantation is most likely maximised.",
    "Discussions with stakeholders have indicated that current needs for dialysis and transplantation are being met; however, there are ongoing stressors to the health system with staffing and resource challenges (e. g. nurses and techs take on extra hours to meet current demand for dialysis or availability of live and deceased donor organs for transplants). An alternative approach to projecting future demand of dialysis uses historical transition probabilities to estimate the potential number of people on dialysis based on disease progression rates (described in greater detail below). Method for chronic kidney disease Stages 3-5 The prevalence of chronic kidney disease stages 3-5 in the UK was calculated based on the prevalence reported in the 2016 Health Survey for England (HSE), the most recent HSE report to examine the prevalence of kidney disease. 118 Analysis was undertaken at a whole UK population level, with population numbers taken from the 2020 Office for National Statistics (ONS) projection in 2020. 119 The benefit of the HSE is that it is designed to be representative of the whole English population and used a form of random population sampling. Similar data was not available for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, necessitating the assumption that this sample from England is representative of the UK and applied to the entire UK population. The patient burden of chronic kidney disease stages 3-5 was projected forward to 2033 using three methodologies to arrive at a final base-case projection (Figure 6). Method 1: The prevalence of chronic kidney disease stages 3-5 was calculated by applying the average expected prevalence of chronic kidney disease stages 3-5 in the over-45 population (10. 1%) to ONS forecasts of the over-45 population. It should be noted that the under-45 population had very low recorded prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the 2016 HSE. Method 2: The prevalence of chronic kidney disease stages 3-5 for this projection is based on the average prevalence recorded in each age cohort in the 2016 HSE (Table 7). 1 18 57 The populations in these age cohorts were projected forward by applying them to the ONS population forecast for each age group. This approach is consistent with approaches used by other bodies to project chronic kidney disease 3-5 prevalence, e. g. UK Health Security Agency (formerly Public Health England). Method 3: This method uses the output of method 2 but adjusts the projection for the estimated excess deaths due to Covid-19 in 2020. 116 This method provides the base case presented in this report. 58 noitalupop 5-3 egats DKC Table 7.

However, it was found that UK studies forecasting diabetes growth used age-stratified population growth as the basis of their projections, which is already accounted for in methods 2 and 3 (base case).",
    "Stages 1-2 To understand the costs associated with chronic kidney disease stages 1-2, estimates from the cost-effectiveness model were used (see methodology for cost-effectiveness model below). As stages 1-2 are not well diagnosed or reported, insufficient data prevented forecasting using the epidemiological model methodology. In the costeffectiveness model, prevalence of chronic kidney disease stages 1-2 was estimated through the 2016 HSE and literature. The cost-effectiveness model utilised transition probabilities to move patients between states. Patients in stages 1-2 can transition to stages 3-5 over time or remain in the same health state. Method for dialysis The starting point for modelling of dialysis is current prevalence based on the 2020 UKKA chronic kidney disease annual report. 34 The number of patients on dialysis was projected forward using the historical compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in dialysis prevalence from 2015-2019 (preCovid-19) and applied to current 2020 figures. As this projection is based on historical dialysis activity which has stayed relatively flat over the last 10 years, it implicitly assumes that despite chronic kidney disease stages 3-5 and end-stage kidney disease population growing, the current health system is maximised with limited ability to accommodate a growth in demand. The unconstrained view of dialysis is an alternative projection of the dialysis population numbers from the cost-effectiveness Markov model. Growth in the dialysis population in the unconstrained view is based on historical transition probabilities of patients in end-stage kidney disease starting on dialysis. The unconstrained view represents the predicted need for dialysis taking into account the historical probability of a patient in end-stage kidney disease receiving dialysis. It does not account for future constraints in the delivery of dialysis to a growing end-stage kidney disease population. Method for transplantation The starting incidence of kidney transplantation is based on the number of singleorgan kidney transplants recorded in the NHS Blood and Transplant Reports on Kidney Transplant. 34, 35 The incidence of transplantation has been projected forward using the historical CAGR in transplant incidence from 2015-2019 (preCovid-19) applied to the most recent data on transplant incidence (December 2021). This projection is the constrained view of transplant and assumes that despite the chronic kidney disease stage 3-5 population and end-stage kidney disease population growing, there is limited growth in the supply of living and deceased donor organs. The unconstrained view of kidney transplant is an alternative projection of the incidence of transplant projected in the cost-effectiveness Markov model. Growth in transplant incidence is based on historical transition probabilities of patients in end-stage kidney disease receiving a kidney transplant and demonstrates the need for kidney transplant in the population but does not consider the ability for the healthcare system to deliver transplants. Method for paediatric dialysis and transplantation Paediatric dialysis and transplant populations were derived from UKKA chronic kidney disease and NHS Blood and Transplant data, respectively. These populations were projected forward using the same CAGR methodology as the adult populations. It was assumed similar costs and productivity losses (for carers) would be incurred to patients families, the NHS and the UK economy in the absence of data specific to this age group. 59 Method for acute kidney injury Previous reports have estimated that acute kidney injury accounts for approximately 1% of the NHS budget. 120 The approach to estimating the burden of acute kidney injury for this report is to provide a simplified update to these previous studies based on more recent data. Starting incidence rates were derived from the 2018 UKKA acute kidney injury report for England and ongoing monitoring dashboard of acute kidney injury alerts in England.",
    "121 Given the dashboard only reports acute kidney injury alerts and not episodes, the number of acute kidney injury episodes was estimated based on the ratio of alerts to episodes from the 2018 report. Where data was incomplete on acute kidney injury alerts, it was assumed that missing data on acute kidney injury episodes would be proportional to recorded episodes within that integrated care board and quarter. A CAGR was calculated based on the 2016-2019 acute kidney injury alert data, which enabled a projection of acute kidney injury forward to 2033 in England. It was assumed the number of acute kidney injury episodes in the UK would be proportional to the rate of acute kidney injury in England as equivalent data was not available for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The cost to the NHS of an acute kidney injury episode was assumed to be 5, 065. In most cases, acute kidney injury may have been part of an admission for a different primary diagnosis and caused excess bed days; however, for the purposes of this estimate, each acute kidney injury episode was considered as its own admission. Method for rare/inherited kidney disease There is limited publicly available information on the epidemiology of rare/ inherited kidney diseases in the UK. The National Registry of Rare Kidney Diseases is an informed consent register that recruits from a large number of hospitals and may not be optimal to support the understanding of the epidemiology of rare kidney diseases. The methodology assumes that a majority of the cost and care burden of patients with rare/inherited kidney diseases are already captured in the chronic kidney disease, transplantation and dialysis modelling. Detailed method: health economic modelling for chronic kidney disease (all stages) A population-level Markov model was used to estimate the current and future incidence/prevalence and economic burden of chronic kidney disease across all stages and show the directional impact of current interventions used based on costs and outcomes. The model was developed to capture both NHS (direct cost) and UK economy (wider economic cost) perspectives. The model schematic was adapted from Wong et al. (2018) to make it possible to explore disease progression between undiagnosed and diagnosed people with chronic kidney disease, and this was the only study identified with a suitable model structure (Figure 7). 122 The schematic was modified to include additional health states for transplantation (acute event), post-transplant, cardiovascular disease (acute event) and postcardiovascular disease. Based on the availability and quality of data, stages 1 and 2 within the model were disaggregated, and stages 3a and 3b were combined. Each cycle length was defined as quarterly (every 3 months) and the time horizon for the model was set to 10 years. 60 Figure 7. Health economic model schematic Figure 7.

    "The starting point for the model includes adults (18) in the UK population, with an average starting age of 49 119 and a chronic kidney disease prevalent population based on the same datasets utilised in the epidemiological modelling. People enter the model at undiagnosed chronic kidney disease stage 1 based on the estimated incidence rate123 and can transition to the next stage using transition probabilities. To determine the probabilities in the diagnosed pathway, values sourced from the literature were used. 124, 125 Based on key opinion leaders (clinicians, data experts, etc) feedback and external validation, the model assumes that approximately half of the patients in the diagnosed pathway were appropriately managed by ACEs and ARBs, and their effects were already accounted for within the probability values. 24 Transition probabilities were adjusted for the undiagnosed pathway based on the relative risk reduction ACEs and ARBs have on chronic kidney disease progression in patients with proteinuria. 26 In the model, patients can only transition forward or remain in the same state in the next cycle. Patients who are in undiagnosed chronic kidney disease 4 transition to diagnosed chronic kidney disease 4 or diagnosed chronic kidney disease 5. Transplantation (acute) and cardiovascular disease (acute) are tunnel states all patients who enter this state transition out in the next cycle. Underlying population mortality was sourced from life tables. 119 chronic kidney disease-specific mortality rates were calculated using hazard ratios sourced from literature and applied to the UK life tables. 22 Unit costs were sourced from NICE, NHS, UK Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) and publicly available literature. 14, 24, 126 Costs were adjusted to 2022 sterling using the UK consumer price index for medical/health inflation factor. Annual or monthly costs were adjusted to be a quarterly cost for inclusion into the model. A micro-costing approach was not considered as this would not be generalisable to the whole UK population. Instead, the model leveraged peerreviewed literature to source costs. 61 Outputs reported are QALYs, direct costs to the NHS, indirect costs (UK economy) and total costs. Utility values are sourced from literature. 127, 128 A base case provides a snapshot of the current burden of chronic kidney disease for the adult population in the UK. The model projects the outcomes and costs of the future burden of chronic kidney disease to 2033 with an unconstrained view. An intervention case estimates the impact of potential interventions on the base case. Through stakeholder engagement and examination of available evidence, four interventions were identified with the potential for patient and system benefits and selected for modelling. Interventions were modelled by adjusting values such as transition probabilities and costs used in the base case to quantify the impact of each intervention individually and combined. The interventions chosen are representative examples affecting unique sections of the disease pathway (Figure 8). In order to prevent any confounding effects of combining interventions, the model assumes that no two interventions will affect the same transition probability or costs within the pathway. The interventions modelled are: 1. Earlier/improved diagnosis (focused on addressing health inequalities) 2. Improved chronic kidney disease management (through better adherence to guidelines on ACEs and ARBs) 3. Use of SGLT-2 inhibitors (to reduce cardiovascular disease events and progression to end-stage kidney disease) 4. Increased rate of transplantation (through pre-emptive transplantation) Figure 8.

Intervention 1: earlier/improved diagnosis Based on feedback from stakeholders, earlier and improved diagnosis has been cited as an important strategy for reducing the economic burden of chronic kidney disease. Unlike for other chronic conditions with established screening strategies, there has been limited consensus by governments and health systems to prioritise early screening and interventions for chronic kidney disease. 129 The burden of chronic kidney disease falls disproportionately on people with lower socio-economic status, as they have a higher prevalence for chronic kidney disease, greater difficulty accessing treatment and poorer outcomes. 129 Prioritising earlier and improved chronic kidney disease diagnosis is a health equity imperative. Based on clinical stakeholder engagement, the largest gap in early diagnosis is among Black, Asian and other minority populations. In the economic model, the targeted population for the intervention was Black and Asian adults aged 65 years and older. The intervention would primarily involve an outreach initiative (e. g. screening programmes) within the community. An example of a current outreach initiative is the Scottish peer educator programme, which works with different faiths from the South Asian community based in either Edinburgh or Glasgow to discuss and answer questions on kidney health, disease and organ donation (living or deceased) and educate audiences on new policies related to kidney disease and treatment. 102, 130 Approximately 15% of adults with chronic kidney disease are from Black and Asian communities, and 54% of people within those communities are uncoded. 12, 34 To model the intervention, it was assumed that 25% of the uncoded Black and Asian population were undiagnosed or not receiving the correct treatment. Under the intervention, they received an earlier diagnosis, which increased the number of people in the undiagnosed chronic kidney disease 1, 2 and 3 stages moving into the diagnosed pathway, where they can be managed through treatment options recommended by NICE. Costs for the intervention include outreach efforts (2 million per year fixed cost), cost of the test and a general practitioner appointment. Intervention 2: improved chronic kidney disease management Optimal chronic kidney disease management can reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage kidney disease. Controlling high blood pressure (hypertension) in people with proteinuria through the use of renin-angiotensin system (renal artery stenosis) antagonists (e. g. ACEs or ARBs) have shown benefits in reducing cardiovascular events, chronic kidney disease progression and mortality. 131 ACEs and ARBs are recommended as a first-line (standard of care) therapy option for people with chronic kidney disease who have hypertension, diabetes or proteinuria (albumin-creatinine ratio 30 or protein-to-creatinine ratio protein-creatinine ratio 50), which equates to approximately 83. 3% of the chronic kidney disease population.",
    "3% of the chronic kidney disease population. 23, 24 Discussions with clinical stakeholders and additional external expert validation have revealed that only 53. 3% of the eligible chronic kidney disease population are receiving the standard care with ACEs or ARBs. 24 Proteinuria is defined as protein in the urine with an albumin-creatinine ratio level of greater than 30 magnesium/g. 63 The model assumes that the intervention will proactively identify the appropriate patients who may be unmanaged or untreated. People who received the intervention would experience the benefit of reducing chronic kidney disease progression to end-stage kidney disease. 26 Costs of the intervention included the annual cost of the medications and additional testing and monitoring. 24 Intervention 3: use of SGLT-2 inhibitors to reduce cardiovascular disease events and progression to end-stage kidney disease SGLT-2 inhibitors have demonstrated significant benefits and an even greater benefit in people with proteinuria 24 in delaying progression of kidney disease and reducing cardiovascular events in people with chronic kidney disease with or without diabetes. While SGLT-2 inhibitors have been approved for use in treating type 2 diabetes since 2013, dapagliflozin was approved in 2022 for use in chronic kidney disease patients with or without diabetes. 24 These new medications help the kidneys to lower blood glucose levels by removing glucose in the urine. 24 The promising outcomes from studies involving SGLT-2 inhibitor use in chronic kidney disease have shown the importance of incorporating this intervention in cost-effectiveness modelling. The eligible population to receive this intervention is approximately 18. 8%. 24 The modelling assumption is that 100% of the eligible population will receive this intervention. The benefit of this intervention is applied in the model by slowing the progression to end-stage kidney disease and reducing cardiovascular events. Dapagliflozin is indicated for use in chronic kidney disease patients in estimated glomerular filtration rate stage 3. Costs for the intervention include annual cost of dapagliflozin and additional testing and monitoring. 24 Intervention 4: increased rates of transplantation For patients with advanced kidney disease, transplants have been shown to be the best form of kidney replacement therapy, as they are associated with lower costs and better outcomes in the long term. 34 Current waiting time for a deceased donor kidney is 2. 5-3 years in the UK. Waiting times for a kidney transplants are long due to a gap in the supply and demand for kidneys. 132 Discussions with clinical stakeholders have recommended increased rates of transplantation as a viable intervention to improve clinical outcomes. To demonstrate the benefits of increasing transplantation rates, one illustrative example identified for the health economic modelling was pre-emptive transplants. Pre-emptive transplants before dialysis have several benefits, such as lower risk of rejection of the donor kidney, improved survival rates, improved quality of life, lower treatment costs and avoidance of dialysis. 133 The benefits of pre-emptive transplants are particularly significant in children and adolescents with end-stage kidney disease. 133 Currently, only 18% of transplants are pre-emptive. 35 To model the benefits of this intervention, a 100% increase in pre-emptive transplants is assumed, and this benefit is applied to patients in chronic kidney disease stage 5 who may be transitioning to KRT. The cost of this intervention is a fixed cost for outreach within the community to promote the benefits of pre-emptive transplants. 64 Epidemiology of kidney disease Prevalence of the various types and stages of kidney disease has grown considerably in recent years, and will continue to grow, although growth rates are likely to vary considerably.",
    "This is due to the varying risk factors driving growth (e. g. changing demographics for chronic kidney disease vs number of acute hospital admissions for acute kidney injury). For dialysis and transplantation prevalence, where actual historic activity data represent a constrained view showing a system that is most likely at maximum capacity, scenarios of constrained vs unconstrained demand (e. g. including potential unmet demand) are provided and vary significantly. chronic kidney disease Factoring in the ageing population and excess deaths in the prevalent population during the Covid-19 pandemic, an estimated 7. 19 million people in the UK have chronic kidney disease (all stages) in 2023 12. 8% of the population aged 16 years or older (Figure 9). By 2033 this will increase to 7. 61 million people. While the overall prevalence as a proportion of the 16 population is expected to remain constant, among the people with chronic kidney disease, the proportion of later-stage chronic kidney disease patients is expected to increase from 45% to 51%. Patients with later-stage chronic kidney disease are more likely to be diagnosed; therefore, the recorded prevalence is likely to increase from the current level. Figure 9.

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease stages 3-5 is expected to increase to 3. 85 million over the next 10 years. This increase is primarily driven by an ageing population. The ageing population also captures a majority of chronic kidney disease risk factors that include diabetes and hypertension. A study estimated 34, 000 excess Covid-19 deaths based on two electronic medical record databases containing patients with chronic kidney disease in England. 116 After scaling the estimate to the predicted chronic kidney disease population in UK in 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic is estimated to have led to an additional 55, 000 deaths in people with chronic kidney disease in the UK. 116 No adjustment has been made for the growth trajectory of the chronic kidney disease stage 3-5 population due to Covid-19, as insufficient evidence is available to make such an assumption at present.

Accounting only population growth in the over-45 population, by 2033, the estimated population of chronic kidney disease stages 3-5 would be 3. 41 million people (see Method 1 black line), but anticipated demographic changes revise this to 3. 91 million people by 2033 (see Method 2 purple line).

    "91 million people by 2033 (see Method 2 purple line). The final projection of 3. 85 million incorporating Covid-19 excess deaths is the most likely case based on the evidence available, if risk factors such as diabetes continue to grow at a faster rate than demographic risk factors. chronic kidney disease stages 1-2 Counts for chronic kidney disease stage 1-2 populations were estimated using the costeffectiveness model. Using prevalence estimates from the 2016 HSE as a starting point, the model predicted that there were approximately 3. 9 million people in chronic kidney disease stages 1-2 in 2023. At the end of the 10-year time horizon, the count of patients in chronic kidney disease stages 1-2 in 2033 declines by 4. 6% to 3. 8 million. The decline in chronic kidney disease stages 1-2 would be driven by the population ageing and transitioning into chronic kidney disease stages 3-5. Dialysis (adult and paediatric) In 2020, there were 29, 354 adults and 226 children and young people receiving dialysis for end-stage kidney disease in the UK (Figure 11). If the historic trend in dialysis numbers, constrained by a maximised health system, continues, then those needing dialysis will rise to 33, 845 adults and 330 children by 2033. Figure 11.

When comparing the estimates from the two approaches, there is a significant gap indicating that the current system does not have capacity to handle the potential increase in demand. To address this gap, investments should be made for advanced action to reduce progression to end-stage kidney disease, and corrective measures should be taken to address future potential staffing challenges.

It is anticipated that a majority of these patients costs are already captured in transplantation and dialysis activity costs, which tend to be the most expensive costs of managing these patients. Comparison to other research on the cost of chronic kidney disease Previous estimates of the economic burden of kidney disease in the UK had a significantly narrower scope to this report. The most similar in scope was a 2012 report focusing on all-stage chronic kidney disease based on 2010 data. 135 The total burden of chronic kidney disease presented in that report was significantly smaller to the estimate presented in this report for the equivalent conditions and disease stages. Figure 17 reconciles the key drivers of that difference both in terms of true changes to the cost base and methodological differences. 74 Figure 17.

(2015). 126 This alone represents approximately 1% of the total NHS budget. By 2033, the cost of chronic kidney disease stages 1-5 is expected to increase by 19% to 2. 32 billion annually. The increase in cost is primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of both chronic kidney disease stages 1-2 and chronic kidney disease stages 3-5 described in the Epidemiology of chronic kidney disease section and have not accounted for inflation. These costs are also not inclusive of the KRT costs, which have been modelled separately, and do not include the cost of innovative treatments that may become more common in these populations by 2033. The cost of dialysis In 2023, the cost of dialysis for people with end-stage kidney disease is 1. 05 billion, or 0. 53% of the NHS budget. A majority of these costs are due to the adult patient population rather than the paediatric population.",
    "A majority of these costs are due to the adult patient population rather than the paediatric population. In addition to the direct cost of dialysis, transport for patients on in-centre dialysis costs approximately 225 million per year. The cost of transport is sometimes incurred by the NHS (e. g. a 2022 study of dialysis in Wales reported that 60% of patients relied on NHS-provided transport), but for the purposes of this report, the cost of transport is included as a separate indirect societal cost. By 2033, based on the constrained model, the cost of dialysis is expected to increase by 11. 5% to 1. 16 billion annually, and the cost of transport for dialysis is expected to increase to 251 million. The increase in cost for dialysis in the constrained model is due to a modest increase in the ability of the NHS to deliver dialysis to patients with end-stage kidney disease and based on the historical CAGR of dialysis from 2015 to 2019 as noted above. In the unconstrained model, the cost of dialysis is expected to increase by 370% to 4. 91 billion annually and the cost of transport for dialysis is expected to increase to 1. 05 billion annually. The substantial increase in cost is due to the rapid rise in the population with end-stage kidney disease who require dialysis in the model. These unconstrained costs represent the upper bound of the cost of dialysis to the NHS based on the projected future demand. The cost of kidney transplantation In 2023, kidney transplants will cost the UK 293 million. Most of these costs are attributable to the transplant procedure itself (including hospitalisation, medicines, etc), while a small proportion of the costs are attributable to care following transplantation. These costs are also inclusive of the cost of adverse events due to transplantation and organ rejection. The cost of newer immunosuppression medicines involved in kidney transplants has not been considered in this report. 76 By 2033, based on the constrained model, the cost of kidney transplants is expected to increase by 43% to 418 million annually. The increase in cost for transplantation in the constrained model is due to the increase in the historical CAGR of kidney transplantation from 2015 to 2019, as noted above, and is contingent on the availability of organs for transplantation. If organs are not available, it is expected that patients who would have received kidney transplants would need to undergo dialysis, which is more expensive per annum and would increase NHS costs further. In the unconstrained model, the cost of kidney transplants is expected to increase by 105% to 600 million annually. The increase in cost is driven by the increase in people with end-stage kidney disease and the historical probability of a patient with end-stage kidney disease receiving a transplant. The cost of dialysis and transplantation to the UK economy In 2023, it is estimated that dialysis and transplantation will cost the UK economy a further 372 million due to lost patient and carer productivity. By 2033, it is expected this will increase to 417 million to 2. 0 billion in the constrained and unconstrained models, respectively. These productivity losses already account for many patients and carers being unemployed due to retirement. As mentioned in the Methods section, there has been limited research on productivity loss due to dialysis and kidney transplantation in the UK context, so research from other countries such as the Netherlands has been relied upon to produce these estimates.",
    "Additionally, it is expected that people with chronic kidney disease stages 4-5 not on KRT would also experience some productivity loss; however, these costs have not been included in the results above. A 2020 study reported that productivity loss in people with chronic kidney disease stages 4-5 ranged from 489 to 19, 951 per year. 127 The cost of acute kidney injury In 2023, acute kidney injury will cost the NHS 3. 13 billion per year, or approximately 1. 6% of the total NHS budget. This is inclusive of costs due to acute kidney injury hospital episodes and postacute kidney injury discharge care. By 2033, the cost of acute kidney injury is expected to increase to 3. 24 billion per year. This increase in costs and acute kidney injury cases is based on historical CAGR of acute kidney injury preCovid-19 (from 2016 to 2019). The cost of paediatric kidney diseases In 2023, dialysis and transplantation for paediatric kidney diseases will cost the NHS 3. 3 million and 8. 5 million, respectively. The cost to the UK economy due to lost carer productivity is 2. 7 million, with transport costing a further 1. 8 million. Based on historical CAGR in the paediatric population with end-stage kidney disease, in 2033, the direct NHS costs of dialysis and transplantation are expected to increase in the dialysis population to 11. 4 million and slightly decrease in the transplant population to 3. 1 million. Productivity loss will increase to 3. 4 million, while transport costs will increase to 2. 4 million. The costs presented for paediatrics have already been included in the costs enumerated in the cost of dialysis and transplantation sections, so they have not been called out separately to avoid double counting costs. 77 Since the burden of kidney disease for paediatric patients who are not receiving dialysis or transplantation is poorly defined, the associated costs of their treatment are not included in these estimates. It is expected that these patients would contribute additional care costs to the NHS. The cost of rare kidney diseases The prognosis of many rare kidney diseases is kidney failure, which ultimately requires KRT. It is anticipated that for many people living with rare kidney diseases, the economic burden of kidney disease is primarily driven by the need for dialysis or transplants. The economic burden of dialysis and transplantation has already been accounted for in previous sections on the cost of dialysis and the cost of transplantation. To avoid double-counting costs, costs for rare kidney diseases have not been enumerated in this section of the report. In addition to KRT costs, there may be additional resource utilisation for specialised medicines for rare kidney diseases and additional resource utilisation for those patients in secondary care services without end-stage kidney disease. At the time of this report, there is limited economic literature around the cost of rare kidney diseases in the UK, and this should be an area of focus for future research. 78 Interventions to manage the burden of chronic kidney disease There is a growing body of evidence that the cost of managing chronic kidney disease can be reduced through early detection, pharmacological intervention and outreach. 136 A key objective for this report was to assess whether a basket of potential population-level interventions for managing chronic kidney disease including end-stage kidney disease would be cost-saving or cost-effective. Cost-saving means an intervention reduces costs of care in addition to benefiting patients clinically. Cost-effective means that the intervention creates clinical benefits for an additional cost, but that cost is within a threshold that represents good value (willingness-to-pay threshold).",
    "The most common metric used to evaluate cost-effectiveness is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), a summary measure representing the economic value of the intervention compared to the alternative (base case). The ICER is the ratio of the difference of costs (direct costs) between the two scenarios to the difference of effectiveness (QALYs). An ICER helps to determine if the intervention is cost-effective or even cost-saving. In the UK, NICE determines an intervention as cost-effective if the ICER is below a threshold range of 20, 000-30, 000. A cost-saving intervention has an ICER of less than 0 when compared to the base case, which means the intervention has negative net costs and greater benefits. Through the stakeholder interviews, several interventions were cited as having the potential to improve clinical outcomes associated with chronic kidney disease. The following interventions were applied to the model: Early/improved diagnosis: This intervention targets ethnic minority groups and other underserved populations through outreach programmes to improve screening opportunities and increase early diagnosis Improved chronic kidney disease management: This intervention targets eligible patients with chronic kidney disease who are either untreated or not receiving standard care according to clinical guidelines (e. g. adequate blood pressure management) Use of SGLT-2 inhibitors: This intervention aims to increase uptake of new medications such as SGLT-2 inhibitors (e. g. dapagliflozin) to reduce cardiovascular disease events and slow progression to end-stage kidney disease Increased rates of transplantation: This intervention models the impact of increased outreach and awareness to increase pre-emptive live donor transplants. It is illustrative of the benefits of improving transplantation rates more generally. To estimate the true impact of the intervention, the interventions were modelled using the health economics model (cost-effectiveness model) with the unconstrained perspective, since several of these interventions affect end-stage kidney disease and KRT. 79 The base case of the model estimated the combined direct costs to the NHS at 70. 7 billion and indirect costs at 20. 3 billion (total burden 91. 0 billion) from 2023 to 2033 within the unconstrained perspective. The model showed that the combined effect of all four interventions generated a costeffective ICER of 7, 688 and reduced the total burden of chronic kidney disease by 64. 6 million when compared to the base case. Implementing all four interventions would increase direct costs to the NHS by 381. 1 million; however, the biggest impact was estimated to be the reduction in indirect costs by 445. 7 million. These cost-savings are primarily driven by the reduction in transportation costs and lost productivity, as these interventions would reduce the number of patients receiving dialysis or having a cardiovascular disease event. Combined impact The combined effect of implementing all four interventions is greater than looking at each intervention individually. The combined interventions had an ICER of 7, 688, which means that as modelled, the combined basket of interventions was cost-effective (7, 68820, 000).",
    "As described in greater detail below, when applied to the unconstrained demand forecast, over the 10 years modelled: Collectively, the interventions reduced total deaths by more than 10, 000 Approximately 50, 000 QALYs were gained They came at a direct cost of approximately 381 million These direct costs were more than offset by savings to the UK economy from increased economic activity and decreased transport costs of approximately 446 million Intervention 4, increased rates of transplantation, was the only intervention found to be cost-saving as well as clinically beneficial Over time, early diagnosis had an increasingly positive impact, and projecting findings beyond the 10-year time horizon showed that the early/improved diagnosis intervention would also become cost-saving by year 13 For all the interventions, the biggest benefits clinically and in terms of cost offsets came from reducing the number of patients progressing to dialysis When applied to the constrained model, the basket of interventions is still cost-effective with an ICER of 21, 890, which falls within the NICE threshold range 80 Combined clinical impact The model estimated that the combined impact of the interventions reduced deaths by 10, 495 over the 10-year period (Table 9). Additionally, 5, 465 people avoided dialysis and over 2, 500 people avoided cardiovascular disease events. The increase in people with chronic kidney disease stages 3-5 (3, 444, 060 vs 3, 467, 156) and transplants (11, 663 vs 11, 725) compared to the base case would primarily be driven by interventions 1 and 4, respectively.

Implementing all four interventions would decrease the burden of chronic kidney disease by 64. 6 million (0. 07% difference) and would increase the total QALYs in the population by 49, 574. While direct costs to the NHS would increase by 381. 1 million, the burden would be offset by savings of 445. 7 million in dialysis transportation costs and patient and carer productivity. Table 10.

    "23, 24 Discussions with clinical stakeholders and additional external expert validation have shown that only 53. 3% of the eligible chronic kidney disease population is receiving the standard care with ACEs or ARBs. 24 Implementation of intervention 2 aimed to capture patients with unmanaged chronic kidney disease or those who were untreated with standard-of-care treatments. This was implemented within the model by reducing the transition probabilities between the health states in the diagnosed pathway to demonstrate a reduction in chronic kidney disease progression (Figure 23).

With slower progression, further downstream effects include fewer transplants (173) and cardiovascular disease events (155). Additionally, 2, 048 people avoided dialysis by year 10 and 3, 491 avoided death over the 10-year time period. Table 13.

While SGLT-2 inhibitors have been approved for use in treating type 2 diabetes since 2013, dapagliflozin was approved in 2022 for use in chronic kidney disease patients with or without diabetes. 24 Dapagliflozin is indicated for chronic kidney disease stage 3. The benefit of this intervention was applied in the model by adjusting the transition probabilities to represent a reduction in the progression to end-stage kidney disease and cardiovascular events (Figure 24). Figure 24F. i gInutree 2rv4.",
    "To demonstrate the benefits of increasing transplantation rates, one illustrative example identified for the health economic modelling was pre-emptive transplants. 90 Pre-emptive transplants (before dialysis is initiated) have several benefits, such as lower risk of rejection of the donor kidney, improved survival rates, improved quality of life, lower treatment costs and avoidance of dialysis. 133 The benefits of pre-emptive transplants are particularly significant in children and adolescents with end-stage kidney disease. 133 To model the benefits of pre-emptive transplants, the transition probabilities were adjusted to illustrate an increased number of transplants per cycle (Figure 25). Additional fixed costs associated with outreach programmes within the community were incorporated when calculating the costs. Figure 25.

This will lead to an 0. 8% reduction in dialysis at year 10 and avoid 614 deaths over 10 years (Table 17). Table 17.

The overall financial burden of chronic kidney disease will reduce by 93. 4 million to 90. 9 billion compared to the base case (91. 0 billion). Overall, 1, 154 QALYs will be gained over the 10 years.

To quantify the impact each input has on the results, it is standard to run sensitivity analyses and scenarios in the model. To test the sensitivity of the inputs within the model, a scenario analysis and one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted. The scenario analysis tests the interventions in the constrained view where the current health systems ability to provide dialysis and transplants is maximised. The one-way sensitivity analysis tests the impact that changes within a certain input will have on output results. The one-way sensitivity analysis adjusts select parameters by ± 20%. One input is adjusted at a time to determine the degree to which the overall results change. Results for the scenario analysis and oneway sensitivity analysis are presented by showing the change in ICER for the combined basket of interventions and assessing whether the interventions collectively or individually are still cost-effective. Scenario constrained view Within the constrained view, the transition probabilities in the health economic (cost-effectiveness) model for dialysis and transplants needed to be adjusted to illustrate the slower transition to stage 5 of chronic kidney disease. Using the 10 year estimates for dialysis and transplantation from the epidemiological model, the goalseek function in Excel was used to determine the approximate transition probabilities. The same inputs used in the unconstrained view to model the interventions were then applied. People who remain in chronic kidney disease stage 5 without moving to KRT due to high waiting times would continue to get sicker. Currently, the model does not capture the decline in health and the added costs that people with chronic kidney disease stage 5 are experiencing due to the restriction of transitioning to dialysis or transplantation states. Within the constrained view, the transition probability from end-stage kidney disease to KRT is low and the true benefit of diverting patients from the dialysis health state through the modelled interventions is not experienced. Figure 26 shows the results of the ICER of the constrained view and the unconstrained view of the combined basket of interventions. The scenario analysis confirms that the combined interventions fall within the NICE threshold of 20, 000-30, 000. Additionally, interventions 1-3 in the constrained view are also cost-effective; however, intervention 4 (increased rate of transplantation) is not cost-effective. Within the constrained view, the benefits of increasing transplantation are not realised within the health economic model since there is a minimal reduction in the number of patients moving to dialysis. Dialysis is a very costly health state. The number of patients who avoid dialysis through pre-emptive transplants does not offset the magnitude of patients who remain in chronic kidney disease stage 5 or move to dialysis, both of which are health states with high costs and lower economic benefits (QALYs). 93 People who remain in chronic kidney disease stage 5 without moving to KRT due to high waiting times would continue to get sicker. Currently, the model does not capture the decline in health and the added costs that people with chronic kidney disease stage 5 are experiencing due to the restriction of transitioning to dialysis or transplantation states. Within the constrained view, the transition probability from end-stage kidney disease to KRT is low and the true benefit of diverting patients from the dialysis health state through the modelled interventions is not experienced.

    "Productivity loss in the UK could reach up to 2. 0 billion by 2033, as a higher proportion of patients continue living with end-stage kidney disease. 8. In 2023, the cost of dialysis for people with end-stage kidney disease is 1. 05 billion annually, or 0. 53% of the NHS budget. In addition to the direct cost of dialysis, transport for patients on in-centre dialysis costs approximately 225 million per year. The cost to the NHS of dialysis to manage kidney disease (per person) is 34, 000 per year more than three times the annual value of a state pension. Premature death can be measured by life years lost, which takes into account frequency of death and age at which it occurs. It is calculated by multiplying the number of deaths by a global standard life expectancy at which death occurs. 96 9. Despite its substantial and increasing cost to the NHS, and the urgent need for new and better treatments driven by research, kidney disease received only 1. 4% of relevant public healthcare research funding just 17. 7 million in financial year 2021/2022. 10. Economic modelling suggests that improved implementation of four illustrative healthcare interventions could save more than 10, 000 lives by 2033. These interventions individually and collectively are shown to be cost-effective or cost-saving, where costs to the NHS are offset by qualityadjusted life years gained. Recommendations Strategic Modelling indicates that significant, cost-effective patient benefits can be achieved through better implementation of existing technologies and guidelines for the prevention, management and treatment of kidney disease. Across the health and care system, a national effort should be made to improve uptake of these interventions. Paediatric kidney disease is relatively rare and historically has not received the attention it deserves. Establishing some oversight of paediatric kidney care from kidney policymakers, in particular to establish better transition management for young adults, has been highlighted by stakeholders as important. The population with chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease is varied in terms of age, gender, ethnicity and the root causes of illness, and therefore the same diagnostic techniques, management strategies and treatments are not effective for all groups. For example, estimated glomerular filtration rate tests have been shown to be less sensitive at predicting outcomes in people who are of South Asian descent. There should be efforts made to personalise the care of patients with, or at risk of, kidney disease across the disease pathway. These should include: Use of the best possible diagnostic tests based on proven effectiveness for the demographics of the specific patient Genetic testing followed by appropriate management for those at risk of inherited kidney disease Patient choice in treatment, e. g. support with home dialysis for patients who feel this would better enable them to continue working and undertaking their usual activities Access to new and proven therapies to manage and slow disease progression in a timely manner Creating an environment fostering innovation and its implementation in real-world settings Kidney disease is complex and is intertwined with other chronic/serious health conditions. The NHS and voluntary sector organisations should seek to break down silos between organisations and teams working on kidney disease and related conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and inherited genetic conditions.",
    "97 Modelling suggests that more proactive engagement with people who are at risk or have kidney disease would be clinically and cost effective, e. g. : Peer engagement to improve adherence to disease management strategies Engaging in proactive discussions around living donor transplants Community outreach to engage underserved groups However, given the frequent multi-morbidity of people with kidney disease, this engagement could be even more cost effective if it addressed multiple health conditions relevant to these populations at the same time. The NHS and voluntary sector should consider how to pool resources and efforts to collaborate across multiple programmes of engagement. Current research funding for kidney disease is just 1. 4% of relevant healthcare budgets, while kidney disease represents 3. 2% of NHS budgets, with a risk of significant growth in this burden. Kidney disease research funding should be increased in line with the clinical and financial burden of disease. Clinical In this report, kidney disease has been referred to as a silent killer, because many patients are undiagnosed or asymptomatic until they reach a later stage of disease. Stakeholder interviews have revealed opportunities to improve adherence to best practice guidelines by making them simpler and more accessible, especially for primary care, where the huge breadth of conditions general practitioners treat is a challenge. In addition, measures should be taken to monitor local adherence to guidelines and intervene where necessary. To address barriers to implementation, focus is required on how best to provide knowledge transfer and pathway/process development. This could include closer collaboration between secondary and primary care, e. g. with regular virtual consultations between general practitioners and kidney specialists. A broader transformation of renal services is needed to improve care through standardisation and knowledge sharing. At the time of writing, in England the Renal Services Transformation Programme (RSTP) was reviewing adult renal services and recommending areas where improvements should be made. The recommendations for service improvement in the areas of early detection, dialysis and transplantation are in alignment with the findings of this report, which also addresses the scale of the challenge across the whole of the UK and the requirements of paediatric services to meet future needs. Severe kidney disease in children can have a similar impact in terms of mortality and lifelong disease to cancer. Because chronic kidney disease is a lifelong, gradually deteriorating condition, children with mild chronic kidney disease are likely to develop severe chronic kidney disease later in life, and therefore early intervention and ongoing management is important. At the time of writing, however, poor infrastructure exists for children with kidney disease transitioning to adult services. Until recently, services were overseen nationally by a clinical reference group that included several other paediatric sub-specialties, which may be a cause for this disconnect. There is now a separate clinical reference group in place for paediatric renal services, and one of the focus areas should be establishing a more effective transition to adult services. 98 Research In the development of this report, several evidence gaps were identified, and further research should be considered to address them: Understanding the rate at which patients progress through the stages of chronic kidney disease is essential to predicting future demand for services. However, much of the data currently in the public domain is out of date, and up-to-date transition probabilities/relative risks of progression of chronic kidney disease for the whole population and subgroups are needed. Understanding the relative risk/rate of progression for undiagnosed populations is essential for assessing the cost effectiveness of early diagnosis and treatment interventions, but there is very little published literature relevant to the UK.",
    "Studies, potentially using real-world data, comparing the relative rates of progression in diagnosed vs undiagnosed populations are required. Sources such as the renal registries provide data on the numbers of patients receiving dialysis. However, there is limited data on unmet need or delays in meeting need, and as more patients progress to later-stage kidney disease, having real-time data which allows monitoring of any potential capacity pressures will become increasingly important. This report utilises evidence from other European countries to estimate the economic burden of kidney disease for the UK. UK-specific studies on the impact of kidney disease on economic productivity are necessary. There is evidence of a strong and complex relationship between kidney disease and mental health. UK-specific studies on this relationship, including the impact of poor mental health on adherence to treatment, are needed. The evidence base relating to rare forms of kidney disease is scarce. Further research in this area is required to understand the natural history, determinants (including genetic), treatment effectiveness and burden of rare forms of kidney disease. Paediatric kidney disease is relatively rare and often complex. Better data and evidence are required to understand the needs of these patients, e. g. studies characterising their epidemiology, demographics and broader health needs. This report has highlighted the multitude of risk factors for kidney disease, but evidence on the causal link between diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease and other risk factors at a population level is scarce. Studies investigating the relationships between these conditions in a predictive manner would provide a powerful tool for population health planning. There are still large evidence gaps on how Covid-19 has affected and will continue to affect people with or at risk of kidney disease. At the time of writing this report, work in this area is ongoing using the OpenSAFELY platform, and it is important that it continues to be supported. There is an opportunity for the four nations of the UK to learn from each other on the management of kidney disease, but inconsistent data is a barrier to this. Introducing more consistent data, e. g. extending the Healthcare England Survey methodology to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, could be an important enabler for driving better health outcomes for the entire UK population.",
