Importantly, progression of chronic kidney disease can be substantially reduced if it is detected and treated early. Here we present the perspectives of a general practitioner (primary care physician), a nephrologist and a patient advocate on howthediagnosisandmanagementofCKDinprimarycarecouldbeimproved. EarlydetectionandtreatmentofCKDare impededby limitedpatient awarenessand knowledge, communication challenges between patients anddoctors, and psychosocialissues, withthesefactorsalsointeractingwith, andexacerbating, eachother. WemakethefollowingrecommendationstohelpimproveoutcomesinpatientswithCKD: (1)identifyingpeopleatincreasedriskofCKDandensuringthey have a complete Kidney health check (including estimated glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate, Urine albumin-Creatinine ratio and a Blood Hypertension check) every 12 years; (2) using simple, nonconfrontational language and supportive resources to communicatewith patients about Kidney health; (3) implementing early treatment to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease and avoid adverse cardiovascular disease outcomes; and (4) asking patient-orientated questions to support shared decision-making and empower patients to be active partners in their healthcare. We acknowledge that limited time is a major barrier to implementing these recommendations in primary care. Utilizing the expertise of the whole practice team, and adopting supportive technology to introduce efficiencies, are likely to be of benefit. By adopting these recommendations, we believe general practitioners have the opportunity to drive improved outcomes and quality of life for people living with chronic kidney disease in Australia.
