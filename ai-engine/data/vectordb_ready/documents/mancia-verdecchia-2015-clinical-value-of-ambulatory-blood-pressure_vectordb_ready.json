Mention is initially made that longitudinal studies conducted in the general population or in hypertensive cohorts have shown that ambulatory blood pressure provides a more accurate prediction of outcome than office blood pressure. Namely, that (1) the risk of cardiovascular events increases in a less steep fashion with office than with 24-hour mean blood pressure, (2) the 24-hour blood pressure-dependent prediction is maintained after adjustment for office blood pressure values, and (3) among individuals with normal office blood pressure, those with increased ambulatory blood pressure (masked hypertension) have an increased prevalence of organ damage, a more frequent unfavorable metabolic profile and a higher risk of new onset sustained hypertension, Diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular events than those with normal ambulatory blood pressure. It is further mentioned, however, that more recently similar observations have been made for individuals with High office but normal ambulatory blood pressure (white coat hypertension) suggesting a complementary role of out-of-office and office blood pressure values in the determination of patients prognosis. The evidence in favor of an independent prognostic value also of some within 24-hour blood pressure phenomena (night blood pressure reduction or absolute values, short-term blood pressure variations, and morning blood pressure surge) is then critically appraised for its elements of strength and weakness. Finally, whether the clinical advantages of ambulatory blood pressure make this approach necessary for all patients with hypertension is discussed. The conclusion is that this is at present still premature because crucial evidence pro or against routine use of this approach in untreated and treated hypertensives is not yet available. It will be crucial for future studies to determine whether, compared with a treatment guided by office blood pressure, a treatment tailored on ambulatory blood pressure allows to improve prevention or regression of organ damage as well as protection from major cardiovascular complications to a degree that justifies the complexity and cost of the procedure.

    "44 different initial SBP values. Data from the Pressioni arteriose monitorate e loro associazioni (PAMELA) population with a follow-up of 148 months. Figure created with data derived from (1) reverse dippers or night blood pressure risers, that is, individuals Sega et al. 14 in whom there is no blood pressure reduction during the night-time or even a nocturnal hypertension and (2) extreme dippers, that the Spanish registry on ambulatory blood pressure, survival free of caris, individuals in whom the night-time blood pressure fall is regarded as diovascular events was progressively greater as night-time blood pressure excessive (ie, 20% of the daytime values). 43 Although the values decreased. 49 Finally, in the previously mentioned large prognostic value of the extreme dipping phenomenon remains database obtained from different populations, isolated nocturcontroversial, evidence is available that the increase of carnal hypertension, that is, an average night-time blood pressure value ≥120 diovascular risk may be particularly marked in patients in mm Hg systolic of 70 mm Hg diastolic, was found to increase whom blood pressure does not fall or increases at night. In the initially the risk of total mortality and overall cardiovascular events by untreated hypertensive cohort studied by Verdecchia et al, 16 29% and 38%, respectively, both increases remaining signifithe risk of cardiovascular events was much more pronounced cant after controlling for office and daytime blood pressure. 50 Interestingly, when night-time blood pressure increased than when it was reduced, the superior prognostic value of night-time blood pressure has been found albeit within the nondipper range. This was the case also in to extend to the development of diabetic nephropathy. Lurbe the Ohasama population in which, compared with dippers, et al51 showed years ago that, in type 1 Diabetes mellitus, albunocturnal blood pressure risers exhibited an 4-fold risk of cardiovasminuria was associated with higher night rather than daytime cular mortality, an increase greater than that (2. 5-fold) seen blood pressure values, and in a subsequent longitudinal study the same in nondippers. 41 Thus, within the nondipper category cardiogroup has observed that an increase of the night rather than vascular risk is likely to increase progressively as the degree the daytime blood pressure predicted development of nephropathy as asof nocturnal hypotension decreases and eventually vanishes sessed by new onset microalbuminuria (Figure 5). 52 (Figure 3)44; this has important practical implications because Further Considerations and Data Limitations nocturnal hypotension is frequently absent or replaced by a The reason for the prognostic superiority of night versus dayblood pressure rise in obstructive sleep apnoea and Diabetes mellitus, betime blood pressure is unclear, although it is widely thought that, comcause of the pressor effect of hypoxic episodes and advanced pared with the daytime, night-time blood pressure values are less affected dysautonomia, respectively. 4547 It is reasonable to speculate by the variable interference of individual diurnal activities, that the High cardiovascular risk associated with these 2 highly thereby more accurately reflecting the usual or true daily life prevalent conditions is at least in part caused by loss of the blood pressure status of the patient. 40 nocturnal blood pressure fall. Knowledge is limited and data are insufficient on several Night-Time blood pressure Values other counts, however. One, whether the protective effect of Additional support to the prognostic importance of the day nocturnal hypotension resides in the magnitude of the blood pressure fall night blood pressure cycle comes from the evidence that absolute night or in the absolute Low night-time blood pressure value is unclear, although time blood pressure values are prognostically superior to the daytime recent observations that in subjects with nocturnal hypertenones.",
    "Finally, there more evident. 61 A more stringent definition should be used is also no question that the degree of nocturnal hypotension also in studies aiming at determining whether a nondipping may be markedly affected by the quality and quantity of sleep, status can be reversible by treatment. At present, limited evia factor which can vary between patients and also within a dence exists that this may be the case with diuretics60 or digiven patient from one recording to another. This is primarily etary restrictions of Sodium intake, 62 possibly because Sodium responsible for the observation that in patients with a stable absorption from the extra to the intravascular compartment antihypertensive treatment and blood pressure, 40% of dippers or nonopposes the night-time blood pressure fall. 63, 64 dippers at a first ambulatory blood pressure monitoring changed status at a monitoring performed few months later. 59 It further explains Morning blood pressure Rise why in a large number of treated hypertensive patients nightSeveral cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarctime blood pressure showed a progressive increase as the perceived duration, 65 stroke, 66 and sudden death67 peak in the first part of the tion of sleep decreased from usual to 2, 2 to 4, and 4 hours morning.

Further support has come predominantly mediated by the autonomic nervous system from the International Database of Ambulatory Blood glucose and vasoactive substances with local or more widespread effects. 78 It has further been established that blood pressure variability inin relation to Cardiovascular Outcome, which has shown, creases with age and that it bears a close direct relationship based on a number of events much larger than that available with the mean blood pressure level. 2, 77, 78 Within subjects the magnitude of in the Japanese studies, that a greater morning blood pressure rise was blood pressure variations becomes greater as the mean blood pressure during the physical examinationaccompanied by a greater risk of cardiovascular and all-cause riod where these variations are calculated. 78 Between subjects, mortality, although the association did not specifically extend 24-hour blood pressure variability shows a progressive increase from norto stroke.",
    "76 It has thus been patients exhibited an increased risk of cardiac events if blood pressure impossible, to date, to determine whether a steeper arousalvariability was greater, although the predictive value was limrelated blood pressure increase has adverse cardiovascular consequences ited to the variability occurring during the night-time. Kikuya via, for example, the disruption of an unstable plaque or the et al84 observed that in a Japanese population, subjects with sudden increase of cardiac afterload in the presence of a rea daytime SD of systolic blood pressure 15. 8 mm Hg had a lower induced coronary reserve. This will only be addressable by precidence of cardiovascular mortality than subjects with a SD cise electroencephalographic identification of the awakening above this cutoff value. Finally, Mancia et al42 found, also in a time coupled with beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring, an approach, general population, that the short-term erratic or residual blood pressure however, hardly compatible with the sample size necessary to changes that contribute to overall 24-hour blood pressure variability in calculate cardiovascular risk. addition to its cyclic components (daynight and postprandial Downloaded from by on December 31, 2025 1040 Circulation Research March 13, 2015 variations) have a significant long-term relationship with carhypertensive than in normotensive subjects, 90 but no informadiovascular and all-cause mortality (Figure 7).
