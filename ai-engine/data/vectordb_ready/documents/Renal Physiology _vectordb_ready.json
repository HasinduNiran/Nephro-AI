Body fluid compartments Daily Water balance The kidneys regulate the daily output of Urine The Renal Physiology Basic Sciences and Clinical Conditions Michael Fields, Carol Pollock, David Harris Elsevier, Second Edition, 2010 Chemical composition of body fluid compartments intracellular extracellular Mechanism for Sodium, Potassium gradient: sodium, potassium pump zero net flux of Water between the two compartments osmotic equilibrium A hypertonic extracellular compartment results in shrinkage of cells A hypotonic extracellular compartment results in Edema of cells Sodium being the dominant ion in the ECF (95%) is responsible for the osmotic activity in ECF Anatomy of the nephron 1. 2 million nephrons in each Kidney Glomerulus (a tuft of specialized capillaries) - afferent efferent arteriole Tubule - Bowmans capsule Renal tubule (specialized epithelial cells): Proximal Loop of Henle (thin descending, thin, thick ascending) Distal Collecting duct Anatomy of the nephron showing relationship between vascular and tubular structures Three processes take place in all nephrons and determine the composition of Urine 1. Glomerular filtration: passive movement of fluid from glomerulus to Bowmans space - the first step in the formation of Urine - a clear fluid (ultrafiltrate) is produced Blood cells and proteins are excluded 2. Tubular reabsorption (99%) 3. Tubular secretion The glomerular filtration barrier excludes Blood cells and proteins Bowmanns space glomerular capillaries The filtration barrier consists of 1. capillary endothelial cells, 2. epithelial cells (podocytes) of the inner wall of Bowmanns capsule, 3. basement membrane (matrix of negatively charged proteins). Protein may appear in the Urine (proteinuria) when there is failure of the glomerular filtration barrier or when tubular cells are damaged nephrotic syndrome The filtration process is based on passive forces. Ultrafiltration occurs because the Starling forces (hydrostatic and oncotic pressures) combine to drive fluid from the lumen of glomerular capillaries across the filtration barrier and into the Bowmanns space. The hydrostatic Hypertension in the glomerulus is the principal driving force, opposed by two pressures, the hydrostatic Hypertension in Bowmanns space and the oncotic Hypertension in the glomerulus (due to proteins in the glomerulus). Glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate glomerular filtration rate volume of fluids filtered by the kidneys every day glomerular filtration rate is equal to the sum of the filtration rates of all functioning nephrons. glomerular filtration rate is on average 180 L /day or 125 milliliters per minute in a 70kg man. glomerular filtration rate depends on sex, age, weight (130-200 L /day in man, 115-180 L/day in women ) A fall in glomerular filtration rate means a Kidney disease is progressing. End stage renal disease: glomerular filtration rate 10% of normal, hemodialysis or renal transplantation. Measuring glomerular filtration rate is important in the clinic Creatinine is used to estimate glomerular filtration rate.",
    "Measuring glomerular filtration rate is important in the clinic Creatinine is used to estimate glomerular filtration rate. Creatinine is produced at a constant rate by the muscle. It is freely filtered at the glomerulus. It is NOT reabsorbed or secreted by the renal tubule. The amount excreted equals the amount filtered. Blood Creatinine is used to measure glomerular filtration rate Curve showing the relationship between plasma Creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (milliliters per minute) An increase in plasma Creatinine indicates a substantial decrease in glomerular filtration rate Estimated glomerular filtration rate includes age, sex, body size and race. nals/estimated glomerular filtration rate-calculator. Water and solute transport along the tubule 180 liters of fluid is filtered by the human glomeruli. Less than 1% of filtered Water and Sodium chloride and variable amounts of other solutes are excreted in the Urine. The processes of reabsorption and secretion determine the volume and composition of the Urine. Transport proteins in cell membranes of epithelial cells of renal tubules. Reabsorption of NaCl and Water are major functions of nephrons. Sodium (sodium) transport along the nephron Daily food intake of sodium: 100 mEq 99. 5% of filtered sodium is reabsorbed by the renal tubule sodium excreted in the Urine is 50-130 mEq/day - small amount lost through gut and skin The amount of sodium that enters our body is excreted in the Urine. The kidneys are responsible for Sodium homeostasis sodium and Water transport along the nephron Proximal tubule 67% of Water, sodium, chloride, potassium and other solutes are reabsorbed, virtually all glucose and amino acids are 67% reabsorbed. Henles loop 8% 25% of filtered NaCl and 15% of Water are reabsorbed 25% Differences in reabsorption between the two limbs are important for Urine concentration. Distal tubule and collecting duct 8% of NaCl, variable amounts of Water (8%-17%) are reabsorbed. Water is reabsorbed by osmosis through aquaporin Water channels (AQP) of epithelial cells or between cells. The transport mechanisms of sodium are different along the nephron - sodium reabsorption in ascending limb of loop of Henle sodium enters the cell by a triple co-transporter in apical membrane. sodium exits the cell by a sodium-potassium pump in basal membrane. This nephron segment is impermeable to Water. sodium transport is inhibited by diuretics (drugs). sodium reabsorption by principal cells of collecting duct (distal nephron) principal cell sodium enters the cell by sodium channels in apical membrane sodium exits the cell by the sodium-potassium pump in basal membrane The steroid hormone aldosterone stimulates sodium reabsorption The hormone vasopressin stimulates Water permeability Control of body fluid osmolality: Urine concentration and dilution A hypertonic extracellular compartment results in shrinkage of cells A hypotonic extracellular compartment results in Edema of cells Sodium being the dominant ion in the ECF (95%) is responsible for the osmotic activity in ECF Control of body fluid osmolality: Urine concentration and dilution Water constitutes 60% of adult human body divided in two compartments (ICF, ECF). ICF and ECF are in osmotic equilibrium because of High permeability of most cells to Water. Water intake occurs orally. The kidneys are responsible for regulating Water balance the major route for Water elimination from our body. Normal range of plasma osmolality: 285-295 mOsm/kg Water. The kidneys maintain the osmolality of body fluids within a narrow range by regulating the excretion of Water. Urine osmolality varies from 50 to 1200 mOsm/Kg. The kidneys produce hypoosmotic (dilute) or hyperosmotic (concentrated) Urine.",
    "Urine osmolality varies from 50 to 1200 mOsm/Kg. The kidneys produce hypoosmotic (dilute) or hyperosmotic (concentrated) Urine. refers to the osmotic Hypertension generated by the number of molecules dissolved in 1 kg of solvent Kidney response to changes in Water balance VC VC What are the mechanisms that restore plasma osmolality? Hormone AVP and thirst Hormone vasopressin, AVP (or arginine-vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone) secreted by the brain. Osmoreceptors in hypothalamus monitor changes in osmolality - the osmoreceptors send signals to AVP synthesizing neurons in hypothalamus AVP is secreted by the Osmotic and nonosmotic control pituitary gland. of AVP secretion Relationship between plasma osmolality, Blood Hypertension and AVP Osmotic control of AVP secretion: AVP is secreted when plasma osmolality increases above a set point. The set point ranges from 275 to 290 mOsm/Kg and varies among individuals. Steep linear rise in AVP as osmolality passes above set point. Nonosmotic control of AVP secretion: A decrease in Blood volume also stimulates AVP secretion. Feedback control mechanism of plasma osmolality Water deprivation increases plasma osmolality - osmoreceptors sense changes in osmolality and signal synthesis and release of AVP (ADH) by pituitary gland. AVP increases Water permeability of collecting ducts of nephrons by adding aquaporins (Water channels) on apical membrane of collecting duct cells. Changes in plasma osmolality and Blood volume or Hypertension leads to thirst thirst center in hypothalamus Water reabsorption from kidneys and Water drinking restores plasma osmolality to normal (negative feedback) When AVP binds to its receptor aquaporin Water channels (AQP) insert in the apical membrane, allowing Water to enter the cell from the tubule lumen. In the presence of AVP distal nephron is highly permeable to Water and a concentrated Urine is excreted by the kidneys. In the absence of AVP the distal nephron is impermeable to Water. Renal mechanism for Urine dilution and concentration Loop of Henle creates hyperosmotic medullary interstitium - osmolality gradient is necessary for removing Water from the tubular fluid High levels of AVP Urine is concentrated Low levels of AVP Urine is diluted Control of extracellular fluid volume (ECF) and regulation of renal NaCl excretion To maintain ECF volume, the ECF volume body monitors the volume of this compartment and, in Volume sensors response to changes, signals (Hypertension receptors) the kidneys to make appropriate adjustments in Kidneys NaCl excretion. Change in NaCl excretion The major solutes in ECF are salts of sodium. Changes in Sodium content of our body are associated with ECF volume: adding NaCl to ECF increases ECF volume removing NaCl from ECF lowers ECF volume Hypertension receptors in central arterial tree (baroreceptors) Several sensing mechanisms detect changes in ECF volume and Blood Hypertension: Heart, intrathoracic veins, central arterial tree and kidneys (Hypertension receptors in the afferent arteriole). Signals - both neural and hormonalcouple volume sensors to the kidneys. The kidneys adjust renal NaCl and Water excretion. The most important effector system in adjusting renal Sodium excretion is the RAAS system A sequence of steps leads to the release of aldosterone by adrenal gland: Renin, an enzyme secreted by the kidneys, converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I ACE enzyme of the lungs converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II Angiotensin II stimulates the secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal glands Aldosterone acts to stimulate Sodium reabsorption reducing Sodium and Water excretion from the kidneys Aldosterone regulates Sodium homeostasis The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated when Blood Hypertension falls and ECF volume is reduced When is renin released by the kidneys?",
    "afferent arteriole Hypertension receptors Cells in the wall of afferent arteriole secrete renin when: Sodium concentration is reduced in distal tubule and when Blood Hypertension is reduced The kidneys regulate the volume of body fluids and participate in the long-term regulation of arterial Blood Hypertension by regulating Sodium transport in the nephron. Diuretics (block sodium transport) and inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme are drugs for hypertension. Role of the Kidney in the regulation of acid-base balance - pH homeostasis Normally the pH of ECF is maintained between 7. 35 and 7. 45. Life cannot exist outside of a range of extracellular pH from 6. 8 to 7. 8. The kidneys, lungs and Liver are responsible for the maintenance of normal pH. The diet of humans contains constituents that are either acid or alkali. Cellular metabolism produces acid and alkali. Alkali is normally lost in feces. For acid-base balance to be maintained, acid must be excreted from the body at a rate equivalent to its addition. The concentration of H is expressed as pH Carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffer is the most important buffering system in the Blood Concentration of H in ECF is 40mmol/L, pH7. 4 Normal range of plasma pH is 7. 35 7. 45 Acidosis 7. 35, alkalosis 7. 45 Carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffer is the most important mechanism of preventing pH changes 1. The CO of the Blood is under the physiological control of 2 the lungs Adjustments of CO Hypertension by changes in 2 respiratory rate by the lungs 2. Bicarbonate of the Blood is under the physiological control of the kidneys The kidneys reabsorb all the filtered bicarbonate The kidneys secrete acid to the tubular fluid Overview of acidbase balance Lungs and kidneys work together to maintain acid-base balance. The lungs excrete CO 2 and the kidneys excrete acid. Carbohydrates and fats are metabolized to CO which is eliminated from the body by 2 the lungs. The metabolism of proteins yields on average nonvolatile acids (not CO ). 2 In an individual ingesting a meat containing diet there is a net endogenous acid production (NEAP). This results in an equivalent loss of HCO from the body that 3 must be replaced. Role of kidneys in pH homeostasis is achieved through the production of acidic Urine (pH5, 5-6, 5) The kidneys reabsorb all filtered bicarbonate (cells in proximal tubule) and produce new bicarbonate The kidneys add acid (secrete) to the tubular fluid (by cells in collecting duct) Tubular cells synthesize ammonia secretion of acid (H) Kidneys excrete acid as ammonium in the Urine NH H NH 3 4 Response of kidneys to acid-base disturbances: renal and respiratory compensation to acidosis Kidney response to acidosis (pH7, 4): reabsorption of all filtered bicarbonate H secretion by collecting duct cells synthesis of ammonia ΝΗ by tubular cells 3 excretion of acid in Urine as ammonium ions"
