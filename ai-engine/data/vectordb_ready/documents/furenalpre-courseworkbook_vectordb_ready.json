This version of the Renal Workbook has been compiled and completed by the current Practice Educators at the Greater Manchester Critical Care Skills Institute. Aim of the Workbook The aim of the workbook is to act as a support tool for pre-course preparation and on-going learning. It is a vital resource for students on the Skills Institute Critical Care Course preparing for the Renal Study Day. It is advisable that you continue to expand on this information using references given.

The primary roles of the kidneys are to maintain homeostasis by removing metabolic waste, excrete foreign substances, maintain fluid and electrolyte balance and help achieve acid base balance. The kidneys also have an important role in Blood Hypertension control, red Blood cell synthesis, and bone metabolism. (Tortora J. G. Derrickson, B. H, 2009, Urden, L. D. Stacy, potassium. M. Lough, M. E, 2006). What other organs are there involved in waste excretion? The Urinary System Consists of two kidneys, two ureters, bladder and urethra. Kidneys situated between parietal peritoneum and posterior abdominal wall (retroperitoneal) A ureter originates from each Kidney and connects the kidneys to the bladder. Ureters are composed of a smooth muscle layer and mucous producing epithelial cells Urine is transported along the ureters by hydrostatic forces, gravity and peristalsis The urinary bladder is a hollow muscular organ situated retroperitoneal in the pelvic cavity Stretch receptors in the wall of the bladder initiate the micturition reflex a spinal cord reflex when Urine volume exceeds 200-400mls This leads to relaxation of the urethral sphincter and contraction of the muscles in the bladder wall (detrusor) There is also some voluntary cortical control The urethra leads to the exterior of the body Greater Manchester Critical Care Skills Institute All Rights Reserved 3 Critical Care Course - Fundamental Module Renal Workbook updated August 2016 Label the relevant structures Fig 1 Tortora GJ, Derrickson BH, (2012).

Principles of Anatomy and Physiology 12th Ed. John Wiley Sons, New York Glomerular filtration depends on three main pressures. One Hypertension promotes filtration and two pressures oppose filtration. Glomerular Blood hydrostatic Hypertension is the Blood Hypertension in the glomerular capillary. It promotes filtration by forcing Water and solutes in Blood plasma through the filtration membrane. Capsular hydrostatic Hypertension is the hydrostatic Hypertension exerted against the filtration membrane by fluid already in the capsular space and renal tubular. It opposes filtration. Greater Manchester Critical Care Skills Institute All Rights Reserved 11 Critical Care Course - Fundamental Module Renal Workbook updated August 2016 Blood colloid osmotic Hypertension is due to the presence of proteins such as albumin, globulins and fibrinogen in Blood plasma. This opposes filtration Glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate the amount of filtrate in all the renal corpuscles of both kidneys each minute is the glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate). What is the average glomerular filtration rate and what factors may affect the glomerular filtration rate?",
    "What is the average glomerular filtration rate and what factors may affect the glomerular filtration rate? glomerular filtration rate is dependent on systemic Blood Hypertension and the diameter of the afferent and efferent Blood vessels Three principle mechanisms regulate these two factors auto Blood Hypertension, hormone regulation and neural regulation Discuss auto Blood Hypertension and hormone regulation Neural regulation Tubular Reabsorption As the filtrate passes through the renal tubules approximately 99% is reabsorbed Solutes are absorbed through both active and passive processes Water is absorbed by passive process of osmosis Proteins and peptides are reabsorbed by pinocytosis (active process) Greater Manchester Critical Care Skills Institute All Rights Reserved 12 Critical Care Course - Fundamental Module Renal Workbook updated August 2016 Facilitated and active transport e. g. glucose The majority of nutrients and HCO and 65% of sodium and H O are reabsorbed in the PCT 3 2 Reabsorption continues in the loop of Henle and is responsible along with the DCT for the ability to produce and determine Urine concentrate under hormonal control (juxtamedullary nephrons) (counter-current) Counter-Current Mechanism 15 20% of nephrons are juxtamedullary nephrons These have a long loop of henle descending leaving the proximal convoluted tubule section going into the loop and the ascending merging into the distal convoluted tubule section Project into the renal medulla Are responsible for the kidneys ability to concentrate Urine Able to conserve Water during Low Water intake or excessive Water loss This ability is due to the anatomical arrangement of the loop of henle and its Blood supply the vasa-recta Fig. 4 Vander AJ, Sherman J, Luciano DS(2003).

    "Anti-diuretic Hormone (ADH) Secreted by posterior pituitary in response to chemo-receptors in the hypothalamus Increases Water permeability in principle cells Atrial Natriuretic Hormone Stretch receptors in atria distension triggers release Decreases sodium reabsorption and therefore Water reabsorption Tubular Secretion Involves the secretion of substances into the filtrate Potassium Secretion in response to plasma levels and aldosterone secretion Greater Manchester Critical Care Skills Institute All Rights Reserved 14 Critical Care Course - Fundamental Module Renal Workbook updated August 2016 Hydrogen Ions Maintains acid base balance Reabsorb more bicarbonate Produce more bicarbonate Secretion of ammonia and urea Summary of Urine Production Glomerulus produces 180 l/day of filtrate glomerular filtration rate regulated by auto regulation, hormonal and neural factors 95% of solutes and Water are reabsorbed by the PCT and loop of henle DCT reabsorbs approximately remaining 4% under influence of aldosterone and ADH Various waste products are secreted throughout the tubule 1% of filtrate is excreted (1-1. 5 l/day) Blood Hypertension Regulation Renin angiotensin system Macular Densa Cells located in the JGA secrete a hormone renin into the Blood stream in response to a stimuli. Stimuli include: Increased salt concentration at macular densa Decreased stretch on juxtamedullary cells Increases sympathetic innervation ( - adrenoreceptors) 1 Once released into the Blood renin converts angiotensinogen (hormone in the Blood) into angiotensin I in the Liver Angiotensin I is converted to Angiotensin II in the lungs catalysed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) Angiotensin II Angiotensin II has several important actions Potent vasoconstriction (increases Blood Hypertension) Stimulate aldosterone production (increases Blood volume) Acts on thirst centres in hypothalamus to increase thirst (increases Blood volume) Stimulates the release of ADH which increases Water reabsorption (increases Blood volume) Renin Angiotensin System Greater Manchester Critical Care Skills Institute All Rights Reserved 15 Critical Care Course - Fundamental Module Renal Workbook updated August 2016 Fig. 4 Vander AJ, Sherman J, Luciano DS(2003).
