If no agreement had been reached on the appropriate grading of a recommendation, a vote would have been held and the majority opinion carried. However this was not necessary for this guideline. All authors made declarations of interest in line with the policy in the UK Kidney Association Clinical Practice Guidelines Development Manual.

The committee would like to thank Mr Bruno Mafrici and Ms Tina Dilloway for their valuable contribution to the section regarding lifestyle management. Updated commentary on NICE guideline (NG136) Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management, with a brief commentary on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Hypertension in Chronic Kidney Disease 2021 4 Measuring Blood Hypertension: 1. 1 We propose that office-based Blood Hypertension measurements using a standardized technique (e. g. pressure-measurement/measure-Blood-Hypertension) should guide all treatment decisions. 1. 2 We propose that non-office Blood Hypertension measurements, taken using a standardised technique and validated monitor (see pressure-monitors/) be considered a pragmatic alternative to office-based measurements. Blood Hypertension Targets for Individuals Without Chronic Kidney Disease: 2. 1 We propose adopting a shared-decision making approach when considering Blood Hypertension treatment and targets for any patient whenever possible. 2.",
    "2. 2 We propose aiming for a Blood Hypertension target of 130/80 mmHg in patients at elevated cardiovascular risk if, following a shared-decision making discussion, it is tolerated by the individual. 2. 3 We propose that there is not enough evidence to inform on a Blood Hypertension target in younger patients and those without cardiovascular risk factors, however if tolerated, aiming 130/80 mmHg is a reasonable goal. Adherence Testing: 3. 1 We propose objective testing of medication adherence in those with resistant hypertension. Lifestyle Modifications: 4. 1 We propose reducing dietary salt intake to a maximum of 6g/day. 4. 2 We propose not using salt substitutes in place of dietary salt reduction. Blood Hypertension Target for Individuals With Chronic Kidney Disease: 5. 1 We propose aiming for a Blood Hypertension target of 130/80 mmHg for patients with chronic Kidney disease to improve cardiovascular outcomes if, following a shared-decision making discussion, it is tolerated by the individual. The shared decision making should be an ongoing and integral process. Updated commentary on NICE guideline (NG136) Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management, with a brief commentary on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Hypertension in Chronic Kidney Disease 2021 5 The publication last year of NICE guideline NG136 Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management1 followed the updated guidance for the management of hypertension from the American College of Cardiology (published in 2017)2 and the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension (published in 2018)3. From a nephrological perspective the American and European guidelines both make recommendations specific to the management of hypertension in patients with chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease), whereas this issue was beyond the remit of the 2019 NICE guideline and instead readers are referred back to the (broader) 2014 NICE guideline4 for the general management of chronic kidney disease. Since 2014 a number of important studies have been published pertaining to the management of hypertension, both in general and in the context of chronic kidney disease. The SPRINT trial5 has received particular attention and has significantly influenced the guidance issued by both the Americans and the Europeans but impacted much less on the NICE recommendations. Currently there is no UK guideline which has incorporated this newer evidence to assist those managing patients with chronic kidney disease. Thus UK clinicians may be left with the dilemma of which guideline to follow. This document therefore has two objectives: first to provide a commentary on NICE guideline NG136 highlighting issues relevant to the renal community, including points of controversy and where the opinions of the UK Kidney Association and NICE differ; secondly we provide (opinion-based) proposals for clinical practice regarding Blood Hypertension (blood pressure) management both in general and also specifically for patients with chronic kidney disease considering the most recent evidence. We also consider the recent impact of COVID-19. The UK Kidney Association supports the majority of recommendations in NICE guideline NG136 and considers the document pragmatic and clinically useful. Of the updated recommendations it is perhaps number 1. 4. 20 that has caused the most controversy: 1. 4. 20 Reduce clinic blood pressure to below 140/90 mmHg and maintain that level in adults with hypertension aged under 80. NICE, 2019 This recommendation is in contrast to that in both the American and European guidelines which generally advocate (if tolerated) a blood pressure target of under 130/80 mmHg. The guidance issued by these two bodies has been heavily influenced by the results from the SPRINT trial5.",
    "The guidance issued by these two bodies has been heavily influenced by the results from the SPRINT trial5. It is interesting that SPRINT was also considered in depth by NICE but interpreted differently ultimately with the conclusion that UK blood pressure targets should not be changed from those recommended in the previous NICE guideline of 20116. Briefly, SPRINT was a randomised trial of over 9000 patients (without Diabetes but with other cardiovascular risk factors) with a baseline SBP of over 130 mmHg. Patients were assigned to intensive blood pressure lowering (target SBP 120 mmHg) or standard treatment (target SBP 140 mmHg). blood pressure was measured using a strict, standardised, office-based protocol (discussed in depth below). The mean achieved blood pressure in the two groups was 121 and 136 mmHg respectively. The composite primary end-point of death from cardiovascular cause or a major cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or Heart failure) was observed in 1. 65% per year in the intensive arm vs. 2. 19% per year with standard care a hazard ratio of Updated commentary on NICE guideline (NG136) Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management, with a brief commentary on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Hypertension in Chronic Kidney Disease 2021 6 0. 75 in favour of intensive treatment and the trial was terminated early (after 3. 3 years instead of the planned 5 years) due to the magnitude of effect. So why, despite these strongly positive results, did NICE elect not to lower its recommended blood pressure target? In the rationale and impact section of NG136, two main concerns are raised. The NICE committee question the applicability of the technique used to measure blood pressure in SPRINT to everyday UK practice. In addition, the potential adverse effects from intensive blood pressure lowering - in particular adverse renal events seen in the trial are emphasised. The UK Kidney Associations viewpoint on these two issues differs somewhat from those held by NICE. In SPRINT, blood pressure was measured using an automated device following five minutes of quiet rest and taking the mean of three readings. The SPRINT protocol did not specify whether blood pressure readings were taken with healthcare workers in attendance or not. The influence of attended vs. unattended blood pressure measurements in SPRINT has been assessed7. Interestingly (and perhaps surprisingly) the presence of a healthcare worker during blood pressure measurement did not impact on the reading obtained. In its guideline, NICE has raised concern as to whether this standardised blood pressure measurement technique can be translated into the typical, busy outpatient clinic environment or GP practice. This issue was seemingly a strong influential factor in the decision made by NICE to not lower the recommended blood pressure target despite the SPRINT results. This concern is despite NICE recommendation 1. 1. 4: 1. 1. 4 When measuring Blood Hypertension in the clinic or in the home, standardise the environment and provide a relaxed, temperate setting, with the person quiet and seated, and their arm outstretched and supported. Use an appropriate cuff size for the persons arm NICE 2011, amended 2019. All recent informative trials have used standardised blood pressure measurement. The evidence-based approach, therefore, would be to issue clear guidance that casual office blood pressure measurements should never be used to guide therapy, and that standardised office blood pressure measurements (such as those detailed by the British and Irish Hypertension Society - pressure-measurement/measure-Blood-Hypertension) should be offered to all patients in whom blood pressure measurement is undertaken in a clinic setting.",
    "Other options, including home and 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) are obviously available and whilst these have not been widely used in the trial setting to assess blood pressure targets, pragmatically the UK Kidney Association considers them to be reasonable alternatives and likely to provide useful information to guide therapy. Home monitoring is likely to take on an even more important role in the future given the recently imposed constraints conferred by the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, a randomised trial of blood pressure management utilising out-of-office measurements is urgently needed. NICE guideline NG136 does support the use of home monitoring and suggests a target of 135/85 mmHg (compared with the office target of 140/90 mmHg) although the evidence cited to support this recommendation is weak (essentially the mean difference between office and home BPs at population level). The modality of blood pressure monitoring will differ depending on patient choice and circumstances. However, whichever technique is employed, it needs to conform to the standard adopted in the trial setting in order for evidence-based targets to be relevant. Updated commentary on NICE guideline (NG136) Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management, with a brief commentary on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Hypertension in Chronic Kidney Disease 2021 7 1. 1 We propose that office-based Blood Hypertension measurements using a standardized technique (e. g. pressure-measurement/measure-Blood-Hypertension) should guide all treatment decisions. 1. 2 We propose that non-office Blood Hypertension measurements, taken using a standardised technique and validated monitor (see pressure-monitors/) be considered a pragmatic alternative to office-based measurements. It is perhaps unsurprising that in SPRINT, intensive blood pressure lowering was associated with a greater risk of syncope, hypokalaemia and acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury). The risk of incident chronic kidney disease (defined as a decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate 30% to an estimated glomerular filtration rate 60ml/min) was also increased with intensive blood pressure control (1. 21% per year versus 0. 35% per year). However, no increase was seen in bradycardia or injurious falls. Interestingly, orthostatic hypotension was seen less frequently in the intensive arm. The issue of acute kidney injury with more intensive blood pressure control has been looked at in a separate sub-analysis of SPRINT participants8. Whilst acute kidney injury was more common with intensive blood pressure control, events were usually mild and reversible - likely reflecting in most cases the haemodynamic consequences of the commonly employed antihypertensive agents. Work demonstrating no increase in biomarkers of tubular damage from those in the more intensive blood pressure lowering arm, despite lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, gives weight to this theory and is reassuring9. There is very limited evidence relating to how patients may balance the risks versus benefits of aiming for a lower blood pressure target. Shared-decision making is the key to this issue and individualising treatment goals and supplying patients with sufficient information to aid discussions, the optimal strategy. 2. 1 We propose adopting a shared-decision making approach when considering Blood Hypertension treatment and targets for any patient whenever possible. 2. 2 We propose aiming for a Blood Hypertension target of 130/80 mmHg in patients at elevated cardiovascular risk if, following a shared-decision making discussion, it is tolerated by the individual. 2. 3 We propose that there is not enough evidence to inform on a Blood Hypertension target in younger patients and those without cardiovascular risk factors, however if tolerated, aiming 130/80 mmHg is a reasonable goal.",
    "Updated commentary on NICE guideline (NG136) Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management, with a brief commentary on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Hypertension in Chronic Kidney Disease 2021 8 The UK Kidney Association fully supports the emphasis NG136 places on assessment of medicines optimisation and adherence at all stages of hypertension treatment and in particular the reassessment of adherence in those reaching step 4 of the treatment pathway: 1. 4. 38 Before considering next step treatment for hypertension discuss with the person if they are taking their medicine as prescribed and support adherence in line with NICEs guideline on medicines adherence. NICE, 2019 1. 4. 45 Before considering further treatment for a person with resistant hypertension: Discuss adherence (see recommendation 1. 4. 38). NICE, 2019 The NICE guideline references the Medicines Adherence Guideline (CG76), however CG76 lists only generic methods for assessment of adherence such as patient self-reporting, using records of prescription reordering, pharmacy patient medication records, and return of unused medicines. Given the significant issue of medication non-adherence in patients with hypertension10 the UK Kidney Association feel it would have been useful for NICE to discuss more objective strategies of direct adherence testing. These include observed pill taking with day case blood pressure/ABPM monitoring, as well as urinary drug metabolite analysis which is now more widely available in the UK (Birmingham Heartlands and Leicester centres are supporting large number of hypertension centres across the country). 3. 1 We propose objective testing of medication adherence in those with resistant hypertension. The lifestyle recommendations in NG136 remain essentially unchanged from the previous NICE guideline. Specifically, in terms of salt intake NICE recommendation 1. 4. 5 states: 1. 4. 5 Encourage people to keep their dietary Sodium intake Low, either by reducing or substituting Sodium salt, as this can reduce Blood Hypertension NICE, 2004, amended 2019 A footnote urges caution about using salt substitutes containing Potassium chloride for certain people, including those with Diabetes and/or Kidney disease and those on blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. Salt reduction in these groups is advised. The guideline may therefore be read as implying that substituting Sodium salt is an alternative to reducing dietary Sodium (salt). A number of studies have showed an association between decreased salt intake and lower Blood pressure11, 12 and the UK Kidney Association feel that the emphasis should be on reducing dietary salt intake for everyone 6g/day. The terminology salt rather than Sodium would be preferable as this is recommended for food labelling and is more easily understood by the public. Substituting Sodium with Potassium salts risks perpetuating a salty palate and it would be better to adapt to foods without salt and appreciate the natural flavours of food. The DASH diet is not mentioned by NICE but we feel is worthy of note as it can help to lower Blood pressure13. Black liquorice should be discouraged owing to its blood pressure elevating potential14. Providing primary health care professionals with training and/or support on how to provide lifestyle education would be valuable. Registered dietitians are best placed to provide this. Updated commentary on NICE guideline (NG136) Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management, with a brief commentary on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Hypertension in Chronic Kidney Disease 2021 9 4. 1 We propose reducing dietary salt intake to a maximum of 6g/day. 4. 2 We propose not using salt substitutes in place of dietary salt reduction.",
    "4. 2 We propose not using salt substitutes in place of dietary salt reduction. NICE guideline NG136 specifically excludes patients with chronic kidney disease and readers are instead referred back to the 2014 NICE recommendations4 for general chronic kidney disease management. This 2014 guideline offers two recommendations regarding blood pressure control, namely: 1. 6. 1: In people with chronic kidney disease aim to keep the systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg (target range 120139 mmHg) and the diastolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg NICE, 2014. 1. 6. 2: In people with chronic kidney disease and Diabetes, and also in people with an albumin-creatinine ratio of 70 magnesium/mmol or more, aim to keep the systolic blood pressure below 130 mmHg (target range 120129 mmHg) and the diastolic blood pressure below 80 mmHg NICE, 2014. The 2017 American Guidelines2 recommend a lower blood pressure target for all adults with chronic kidney disease: 9. 3: Adults with hypertension and chronic kidney disease should be treated to a blood pressure goal of less than 130/80 mmHg. The 2018 European Hypertension guidelines3 offer a third alternative to the NICE and American recommendations: 8. 12: In patients with diabetic or non-diabetic chronic kidney disease it is recommended to lower SBP to a range of 130139 mmHg. Individualized treatment should be considered according to its tolerability and impact on renal function and electrolytes. The American and European guidelines for chronic kidney disease have been influenced (to different degrees) by SPRINT and it is anticipated that the eagerly awaited Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes hypertension guidelines (presented in part at Kidney Week 2019) will follow suit. SPRINT included over 2500 patients with (non-diabetic) chronic kidney disease with a mean estimated glomerular filtration rate of 48ml/min and minimal proteinuria (mean albumin-creatinine ratio 9mg/mmol). Of note, SPRINT excluded patients with proteinuria 1g/day, Diabetes, polycystic Kidney disease, and patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate 20ml/min. Analysis of the main trial indicated that the presence of chronic kidney disease did not significantly modify the primary outcome (p value for interaction 0. 36). In addition, a pre-specified subgroup analysis was undertaken for this chronic kidney disease cohort15. Interpretation of the data needs relative caution as the study was not powered for subgroup analysis and was terminated early, however the results are worthy of discussion. The primary composite cardiovascular outcome occurred in 112 of those in the intensive group and 131 in the standard group with a hazard ratio of 0. 81 (95% confidence interval 0. 63 to 1. 05). A lower rate of all-cause death was seen in the intensive arm with a hazard ratio of 0. 72 (95% confidence interval 0. 53 to 0. 99). The proportional reduction in CV events and total mortality was similar in the chronic kidney disease subgroup and in the main trial (p for interaction 0. 30 and 0. 95 respectively). In terms of renal disease progression, the pre-specified composite endpoint of 50% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate or occurrence of end-stage renal disease did not differ between groups although the number of events was extremely small (15 vs 16 in the intensive and standard arms respectively). A reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30% did occur more frequently with intensive blood pressure lowering (as it did in the main trial) but whether this is clinically relevant given the reduction in harder endpoints remains uncertain.",
    "Further analysis has suggested that the magnitude of Updated commentary on NICE guideline (NG136) Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management, with a brief commentary on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Hypertension in Chronic Kidney Disease 2021 10 effect in reducing cardiovascular endpoints with intensive blood pressure reduction may be attenuated at lower levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate and this issue requires further study16. The adverse effects observed in the chronic kidney disease cohort essentially mirrored those in the main trial with increased risks of Potassium disturbances and acute kidney injury in the intensive arm. However, no increase in hypotension-related events was seen including syncope and injurious falls. No differences were seen in Sodium abnormalities or bradycardia. Previous studies assessing optimal blood pressure targets in chronic kidney disease have primarily focussed on renal outcomes17. These have differed by design and inclusion criteria and yielded varying results. None have been sufficiently powered to evaluate hard cardiovascular endpoints or mortality. Thus data from SPRINT provide the strongest evidence to date to inform about the effects of intensive blood pressure lowering on cardiovascular events in patients with renal impairment. This is important considering the extremely High burden of cardiovascularrelated morbidity and mortality in individuals with chronic kidney disease. Intensive lowering of blood pressure in patients with chronic kidney disease will undoubtedly lead to adverse sequelae in a minority of patients. Therefore, the importance of adopting a shared-decision making process regarding individualised blood pressure targets cannot be emphasised enough. Monitoring blood pressure using a standardised technique is also vital. Nonetheless the UK Kidney Association considers that on balance, aiming for a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg is likely to be beneficial in the majority of individuals with chronic kidney disease and treating to this target should be considered in all patients. 5. 1 We propose aiming for a Blood Hypertension target of 130/80 mmHg for patients with chronic Kidney disease to improve cardiovascular outcomes if, following a shared-decision making discussion, it is tolerated by the individual. Updated commentary on NICE guideline (NG136) Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management, with a brief commentary on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Hypertension in Chronic Kidney Disease 2021 11 March 2021 saw the publication of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Hypertension in Chronic Kidney Disease18. This long-awaited update to the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline aims for a lower Blood Hypertension target when compared to the NICE guideline NG1361, American College of Cardiology2, and European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines3. The new Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline update highlights two aspects of practice change: emphasising the importance of accurately recording office Blood Hypertension readings, to allow the findings of SPRINT to be implemented as a new, lower SBP target of 120mmHg in chronic kidney disease patients not receiving Dialysis. Standardised office blood pressure measurement is recommended in preference to routine office blood pressure measurement. The checklist for standardised office Blood Hypertension measurement19 (Figure 1) should be seen as standard operating procedure for any clinician measuring Blood Hypertension. Of note, there is no requirement for the standardised office Blood Hypertension monitoring to be unattended, indeed many sites in the SPRINT study performed attended automated office Blood Hypertension.",
    "This will require clinicians to look at ways to deliver this within the limitations of their clinical environment, but the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline places greater importance on standardised accurate office blood pressure measurement over any potential increased burden to patients and clinicians. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Work Group repeatedly emphasise the importance of standardised blood pressure measurement when applying the blood pressure targets, stressing the risk of both overand under-treatment through adjusting antihypertensive medication based on routine non-standardised blood pressure readings. The challenge of implementing standardised blood pressure measurement in an outpatient clinic or GP practice is a concern raised by many, and might have influenced the choice of Blood Hypertension targets in the NICE guidance. Few clinicians outside of a research setting would be able to guarantee that readings in their clinical service are recorded according to a standardised protocol21, but the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline should be a call to review our current practice and develop local solutions to implementation. Regardless of the Blood Hypertension target we are aiming for, it is imperative that we are able to accurately measure Blood Hypertension in all our patients, not just those participating in clinical trials. Figure 1: Updated commentary on NICE guideline (NG136) Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management, with a brief commentary on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Hypertension in Chronic Kidney Disease 2021 12 Standardised Blood Hypertension measurement18 To recap, NICE guideline NG136 recommends reducing clinic blood pressure to below 140/90mmHg in adults with hypertension aged under 80. The guideline excludes patients with chronic kidney disease and refers readers back to the 2014 NICE recommendations4 for general chronic kidney disease management; aiming for SBP 140mmHg (target 120-139mmHg) and DBP 90mmHg in people with chronic kidney disease, and a lower target of SBP130mmHg (target 120-129mmHg) and DBP 80mmHg in those with chronic kidney disease and Diabetes or chronic kidney disease and albumin-creatinine ratio ≥ 70mg/mmol. Of note, the 2021 update to the chronic kidney disease guidelines (NG203)20 no longer distinguishes between those with and without Diabetes in terms of recommended blood pressure targets. NG203 recommends aiming for clinic SBP 140mmHg (target 120-139mmHg) and DBP 90mmHg in people with chronic kidney disease and albumin-creatinine ratio 70mg/mmol, and a lower target of SBP130mmHg (target 120129mmHg) and DBP 80mmHg in those with chronic kidney disease and albumin-creatinine ratio ≥ 70mg/mmol. The rationale given in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidance for targeting a lower SBP of 120mmHg was to offer cardioprotective, survival, and cognitive benefits, whilst acknowledging no significant reno-protective benefit. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline recognises that the evidence for 120mmHg was weaker in certain patient groups (including diabetics, chronic kidney disease stage 4 and 5, those with significant proteinuria, patients with very Low DBP, white-coat hypertension, and extremes of age)21, and that in those patient groups there is a stronger need for clinical nuance and shared decision making in determining an individual patients treatment target. The guideline makes the Practice Point that patients with very limited life expectancy or symptomatic postural hypotension can be offered less intensive blood pressure lowering therapy. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline chose to deliver a clear message in recommending a single SBP target of 120mmHg, with the aim of reducing potential physician treatment inertia that can occur with multiple, sub-group treatment targets within one guideline.",
    "The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline recommends the use of ACE inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) or angiotensin receptor blockers (angiotensin receptor blocker) in patients with chronic kidney disease and increased albuminuria, with or without Diabetes. It notes that the evidence for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use in patients with moderately raised albuminuria (albuminuria category A2) is lower in quality when compared to the evidence for use in patients with severely raised albuminuria (albuminuria category A3). The guideline recommends avoiding any combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, and direct renin inhibitor in patients with chronic kidney disease for the risk of hyperkalaemia and the absence of evidence for any added benefit. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidance does not make recommendation for Blood Hypertension targets in patients on Dialysis. It does however recommend a separate target for adult Kidney transplant recipients (chronic kidney disease G1T G5T) of SBP 130mHg and DBP 80mmHg using standardised office blood pressure measurement. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Work Group chose not to target SBP 120mmHg in this group due to evidence of higher rates of estimated glomerular filtration rate decline in patients in the intensive blood pressure arm of the SPRINT study. Given that transplant recipients have a single-functioning, denervated Kidney, concern was raised the Work Group regarding potentially higher risk of adverse events with SBP targets of 120mmHg. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline also made recommendations on the type of antihypertensive used in renal transplant recipients, recommending either a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (calcium channel blocker) or angiotensin receptor blocker be used first line. This recommendation was based upon data showing reduced graft loss in patients taking dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker compared to placebo, in both normotensive and hypertensive patients. Similarly, the use of angiotensin receptor blocker compare to placebo was associated with a reduction in graft loss. There was no benefit from calcium channel blocker or angiotensin receptor blocker in terms of mortality or cardiovascular event rates. There was no benefit in terms of mortality or graft loss in patients receiving an ACE inhibitor. Updated commentary on NICE guideline (NG136) Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management, with a brief commentary on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Hypertension in Chronic Kidney Disease 2021 13 The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline suggests that patients with hypertension and chronic kidney disease are advised to undertake, where tolerated, at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline recommends targeting a salt intake of 5 g per day, and has a Practice Point noting that salt substitutes rich in Potassium may not be appropriate for certain groups of patients with chronic kidney disease. Although the target intake differs from the NICE recommended target of maximum of 6g/day, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes level was chosen to provide agreement with existing guidelines to facilitate public health policy decisions. COVID-19 has thrown ultrasound into a clinical environment where the majority of outpatient services had to be reconfigured overnight into virtual clinics. This model of working was new for many clinicians, and has posed many new challenges in delivering safe patient care. There is a risk of clinician inertia in treating to lower blood pressure targets that might be heightened by the challenges of virtual clinics being delivered without predesigned pathways for service delivery."
