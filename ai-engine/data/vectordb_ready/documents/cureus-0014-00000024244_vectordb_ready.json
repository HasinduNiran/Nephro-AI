Corresponding author: Elmukhtar Habas Sr. , habas1962gmail. com Abstract Hypertension (hypertension) is common in chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease), and it may aggravate chronic kidney disease progression. The optimal Blood Hypertension (blood pressure) value in chronic kidney disease patients is not established yet, although systolic blood pressure ≤130 mmHg is acceptable as a target. Continuous blood pressure monitoring is essential to detect the different variants of High blood pressure and monitor the treatment response. Various methods of blood pressure measurement in the clinic office and at home are currently used. One of these methods is ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), by which blood pressure can be closely assessed for even diurnal changes. We conducted a non-systematic literature review to explore and update the association between High blood pressure and the course of chronic kidney disease and to review various blood pressure monitoring methods to determine the optimal method for blood pressure recording in chronic kidney disease patients. PubMed, EMBASE, Google, Google Scholar, and Web Science were searched for published reviews and original articles on blood pressure and chronic kidney disease by using various phrases and keywords such as hypertension and chronic kidney disease, chronic kidney disease progression and hypertension, chronic kidney disease stage and hypertension, blood pressure control in chronic kidney disease, blood pressure measurement methods, diurnal blood pressure variation effect on chronic kidney disease progression, and types of hypertension. We evaluated and discussed published articles relevant to the review objective. Before preparing the final draft of this article, each author was assigned a section of the topic to read, research deeply, and write a summary about the assigned section. Then a summary of each authors contribution was collected and discussed in several group sessions. Early detection of High blood pressure is essential to prevent chronic kidney disease development and progression. Although the latest Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines suggest that a systolic blood pressure ≤120 mmHg is the target to prevent chronic kidney disease progression, systolic blood pressure ≤130 mmHg is universally recommended. ABPM is a promising method to diagnose and follow up on blood pressure control; however, the High cost of the new devices and patient unfamiliarity with them have proven to be major disadvantages with regard to this method.",
    "Categories: Internal Medicine, Nephrology, Public Health Keywords: hypertension, blood pressure record, blood pressure diurnal variation, home Blood Hypertension, chronic kidney disease progression Introduction And Background Chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) is a global health problem, with an estimated prevalence of 11-13% 1, and it is continuously on the rise 2. chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage renal disease (end-stage renal disease) in rare cases 3 as well as cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease), leading to High rates of mortality 4. chronic kidney disease prevention and reducing its progression rate are major concerns in healthcare settings. The prevalence of hypertension (hypertension) in chronic kidney disease patients is 80-85%, which is significantly higher than in the general population (28. 5%) 5, 6. This difference in hypertension prevalence is attributed to an increase in the aging population 7 as well as the prevalence of Diabetes mellitus 8. Blood Hypertension (blood pressure) changes are associated with alteration of Kidney function, and High blood pressure worsens chronic kidney disease, thereby increasing end-stage renal disease incidence and cardiovascular disease risk 9, 10. Optimum blood pressure control is essential in chronic kidney disease patients to prevent chronic kidney disease progression and other complications 11. hypertension prevalence is inversely related to the estimated glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate), increasing significantly from 67% in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 to 92% in those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 12, 13. The variability of 24-hour blood pressure in chronic kidney disease patients is higher than that in the general population 14. In addition, a mean systolic blood pressure 120 mmHg is associated with imminent chronic kidney disease and increases the rate of sudden renal function deterioration 9. Studies have reported that lowering blood pressure reduces chronic kidney disease progression and cardiovascular disease risks; however, the ideal blood pressure value in chronic kidney disease patients has yet to be established 15, 16. The most recent guidelines state that a blood pressure 120 mmHg as the lowest targeted is desirable in chronic kidney disease patients; nevertheless, the targeted blood pressure in chronic kidney disease patients differs between various published How to cite this article Habas E, Habas E, Khan F Y, et al. (April 18, 2022) Blood Hypertension and Chronic Kidney Disease Progression: An Updated Review. Cureus 14(4): e24244. DOI 10. 7759/cureus. 24244 guidelines 11, 17. Furthermore, it has been recently reported that intensive blood pressure control may reduce estimated glomerular filtration rate and increase tubule biomarkers 18. Mercury-based sphygmomanometer devices are the primary blood pressure measuring techniques currently used. However, automatic, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), and ultrasonic-based methods have recently gained currency as blood pressure recording techniques. Each technique has its own limitations, advantages, disadvantages, and abilities to detect blood pressure variations and assess the response to treatment. In light of this, we aim to discuss and update the effect of blood pressure on chronic kidney disease progression and explore the various methods of blood pressure recording in chronic kidney disease patients. Review chronic kidney disease and hypertension chronic kidney disease is classified into five main stages and further subdivided into subgroups according to the glomerular filtration rate value and albuminuria 19. There is reportedly an evident association between the interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy and the mean 24-hour ABPM records 20. There is substantial evidence to indicate that chronic kidney disease is strongly linked to uncontrolled High blood pressure, resistant hypertension, masked hypertension, and even normotensive non-dipping blood pressure records 21. In their study, Aggarwal et al.",
    "Primary hypertension accounts for the majority of cases (95%), and it has no known cause. Thyroid disorders, sleep apnea, excessive alcohol use, obesity, High-salt food consumption, tumors, adrenal hyperfunction, medicines, Kidney illness, and other factors are all linked to secondary hypertension. In addition to these hypertension categories, other types such as isolated systolic, malignant, resistant, labile, and white-coat HTNs have also been identified, and these have their own particular diagnostic criteria. Isolated systolic hypertension is diagnosed when the systolic blood pressure is 140 mmHg, and the diastolic blood pressure is ≤80 mmHg. Isolated systolic hypertension is more widely prevalent in people aged 65 years, and it is most probably due to arterial wall stiffness 29. The incidence of malignant hypertension type is two new cases/100, 000/year in the general population 30. It is highly prevalent among young adults, individuals with eclampsia, and African American men 30. Malignant hypertension is diagnosed when the blood pressure increases suddenly and the diastolic blood pressure reaches 130 mmHg and when there are bilateral retinal exudates and/or hemorrhages, with or without 2022 Habas et al. Cureus 14(4): e24244. DOI 10. 7759/cureus. 24244 2 of 9 papilledema 31. It is considered a medical emergency and needs prompt management. Malignant hypertension is a type of hypertension in which the systolic blood pressure is ≥140 mmHg or the diastolic blood pressure is ≥90 mmHg despite the concurrent use of three antihypertensive medications of various classes, including a diuretic, or controlled blood pressure with more than four antihypertensive medications 11. Resistant hypertension has been reported in 20-30% of hypertensive cases. Resistant hypertension appears to have an underlying genetic component. It is commonly seen in the elderly, obese women, African Americans, diabetics, and chronic kidney disease patients. White-coat and labile hypertension are types of hypertension that are not uncommon. These terms have been alternatively used to label cases with High normal blood pressure levels. These cases are more likely to have hypertension, although they may indicate an increase in blood pressure as a physiological response. Labile hypertension occurs in almost every individual, and it can be related to blood pressure record changes due to factors such as stress, environment, food, etc. On the other hand, a white-coat hypertension diagnosis is usually given to subjects who have High blood pressure levels when measured by a medical professional but have normal blood pressure levels when recorded in other settings. Therefore, due to the variability of blood pressure values and the effect of white-coat, the American Heart Association recommends that blood pressure measurement must be conducted a minimum of three times during different times of the day for a precise hypertension diagnosis. However, some physicians prefer to reassess blood pressure 5-10 minutes after the first High blood pressure record in the same setting in a single visit. White-coat hypertension was reported in 28. 8%, and masked hypertension was noted in 7% of chronic kidney disease patients in one study 32, causing chronic kidney disease and affecting its progression. Night-time hypertension and non-dipping night blood pressure patterns are the other types that may negatively affect end organs. Non-dipping is not a specific independent risk factor that negatively impacts chronic kidney disease outcomes, although it is a recognized risk factor for chronic kidney disease progression. However, the early studies on the subject were not controlled for proteinuria. Proteinuria has been linked to blood pressure non-dipping, and proteinuria is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease deterioration 33.",
    "Proteinuria has been linked to blood pressure non-dipping, and proteinuria is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease deterioration 33. As a result, it was proposed that the non-dipping blood pressure effect on chronic kidney disease development is doubtful, but instead, non-dipping is a pathological process that may increase chronic kidney disease deterioration. Furthermore, when non-dipping was examined as a risk factor for mortality, end-stage renal disease, and cardiovascular disease events, it was found to be insignificant when daytime blood pressure or 24-hour blood pressure were considered and cardiovascular disease event risk factors were excluded 33, 34. However, according to one study, non-dipping is still a significant risk factor for both end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular disease events, even after controlling for blood pressure, when it was assessed by 24-hour monitoring, in the presence of proteinuria 35. There is enough evidence to show that all phenotypes of hypertension occur in chronic kidney disease patients, thereby affecting chronic kidney disease development and progression. hypertension is a well-known cause of chronic kidney disease, and chronic kidney disease is also a cause of secondary hypertension. hypertension associated with chronic kidney disease causes is multi-factorial. Sodium dysregulation 36, decreased Kidney tissue mass and function 37, increased sympathetic system activity, and distributed renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system function 38 are the possible mechanisms of hypertension in chronic kidney disease patients. Advanced chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2) is characterized by endothelial dysfunction, and these endothelial alterations are strongly related to hypertension 39. Additionally, chronic kidney disease is associated with an increased rate of arterial stiffness 40, implying the development of hypertension 41. As hypertension progresses, variables such as increased oxidative metabolism associated with renal hypoxia may contribute to elevated blood pressure and chronic kidney disease progression 42, 43. Detection of these phenotypes is not usually possible with the clinic office blood pressure measurement methods, but these are easily detected with ABPM. It appears that ABPM is the best method to differentiate between various hypertension phenotypes and also to assess their response to therapy. General considerations for High-blood pressure management The number of hypertensive patients aged between 30 and 79 years has doubled in the recent decades, increasing from an estimated 317 million men and 331 million women in 1990 to about 626 million women and 652 million men in 2019. More than 50% of these hypertensive individuals (720 million) received no treatment in 2019 44. Globally, only 23% and 18% of women and men had well-controlled blood pressure respectively. The increase in the hypertension rate is mainly due to the increase in the number of aging populations worldwide. The rising number of hypertensive population has not shown a uniform pattern, and hypertension prevalence is higher in most Lowand middle-income countries. In High-income countries, counterweighing progress in hypertension prevalence reduction has been noted. It has been claimed that the great success in early hypertension detection and treatment in developed countries has indicated the possibility of reducing hypertension prevalence and complications in middleand Low-income countries as well 45. Setting optimal blood pressure targets has a sizeable clinical impact 11 on morbidity, mortality, and renal function outcomes. According to the published guidelines, systolic blood pressure of 130 mmHg is categorized as stage 1 hypertension. Non-chronic kidney disease patients with this level of blood pressure have been advised to change their eating and exercise habits to control their blood pressure. The reports on hypertension management among chronic kidney disease patients have been inconclusive.",
    "The reports on hypertension management among chronic kidney disease patients have been inconclusive. Studies have revealed that a targeted blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, as compared to a blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, is useful in decelerating renal disease progression in proteinuric chronic kidney disease patients; however, other studies have not endorsed these suggestions 36. A significant reduction in mortality rate after intensive blood pressure control in chronic kidney disease patients has not been consistently validated in RCTs, as other trials were not powered enough to investigate this outcome, and the supporting evidence was primarily obtained from observational studies 46, 47. However, a study by Ku et al. has suggested that strict blood pressure control has no effect on delaying end-stage renal disease onset, even though it may decrease the risk of mortality in chronic kidney disease cases 48. There is evidence to suggest that the advocated mortality benefit could depend on proteinuria existence at presentation; however, this 2022 Habas et al. Cureus 14(4): e24244. DOI 10. 7759/cureus. 24244 3 of 9 assumption was also derived from observational trials 36, 49. Additionally, the incidence of cardiovascular disease outcomes in chronic kidney disease patients who were adherent to intensive targets was poorly characterized 15. blood pressure measurement methods and recommendations blood pressure measurement is usually conducted by a doctor or nurse with a sphygmomanometer in their clinics; however, the recent wide availability of semi or fully automatic machines has enabled medical professionals or patients themselves to measure blood pressure. Currently, there are four methods to measure blood pressure. A. Clinic Office blood pressure Measurement Methods Clinic office blood pressure recording needs to fulfill specific requirements, which are summarized in Table 1 50. Factors Description blood pressure measurement Office of the physician or the nurse place Condition of A quiet room with a temperature between 36. 537. 5 oC place Before blood pressure recording: no cigarette smoking, no caffeine consumption, and no exercise (even walking) for 30 minutes; empty bladder; Patient status should remain seated and relaxed for at least 35 minutes The machine must be validated, especially the oscillometric electronic machine, regularly. Validated accurate electronic devices for use Machine in office and home, and ambulatory blood pressure measurement devices for adults and pregnant women are available Patients and staff should not communicate before, during, and between measurements. The patient must be sitting, and the arm must Patient and be rested on a table at the level of the Heart. The patients back should be supported on a chair. The patients feet must be in a flat the personnel position, and legs should be uncrossed Cuff and Cuff and its balloon should be selected according to the individuals arm circumference. A manual auscultatory inflatable balloon should balloon cover 75100% of the arm circumference. For the cuffs of electronic devices, see the instruction booklet that comes with the device blood pressure Three records must be taken a minute apart during each visit, and a mean of the last two stable records is then calculated. If the first measurement blood pressure record is 130/85 mmHg, no more re-measurements are needed. If 2-3 office-based records show blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg, it indicates protocol hypertension TABLE 1: blood pressure measurement requirements and conditions blood pressure: Blood Hypertension 1. Auscultatory method: this method is the gold standard for clinic office blood pressure recording. This mercury-based device used to measure blood pressure is currently sparingly used and even abandoned in various countries due to the toxicity risk associated with mercury 51. New hybrid incorporated sphygmomanometers are rapidly replacing the old version of mercury-based devices.",
    "New hybrid incorporated sphygmomanometers are rapidly replacing the old version of mercury-based devices. The mercury-based sphygmomanometer method requires a medical professional to detect Korotkoff sounds and record blood pressure, which may adversely affect blood pressure records 51. Automatic and aneroid blood pressure record devices are more practical, and people can use them independently, even in the clinic; however, their lack of precision and the need for regular calibration limit their use 51. 2. Automated office blood pressure monitoring: novel non-mercury-based oscillometric devices are now widely used for blood pressure recording in the clinic office 52, and other sites such as pharmacies, homes, and work offices. These devices are either semi-automatic or fully automatic, which can sense the changes in the Blood flow and the artery wall that refect the blood pressure record, thereby reducing blood pressure variability due to the presence of medical staff, although it may increase patient blood pressure reporting bias. B. Home Self-blood pressure Monitoring Methods 1. Intermittent home self-blood pressure measurement method: intermittent blood pressure monitoring by fully automatic electronic devices at home is widely practiced in developed countries to confirm hypertension and follow up on the response to treatment. Furthermore, the intermittent home blood pressure recording method is a more suitable and acceptable alternative to the ABPM method to differentiate between hypertension phenotypes 53. Higher intermittent home blood pressure values are associated with chronic kidney disease progression compared to clinic office-based blood pressure records 54. However, the High cost of the device, patient unfamiliarity, and inaccurately reported records by 2022 Habas et al. Cureus 14(4): e24244. DOI 10. 7759/cureus. 24244 4 of 9 the subjects have made the home blood pressure monitoring method not very ideal. A home-clinic blood pressure telemonitoring system has been invented to minimize patient blood pressure reporting bias, especially in hypertension control follow-ups. Recently, it was reported that the zero digits in the electronic device have reduced the chance of bias and inaccurate patient reporting 55. 2. ABPM method: ABPM has been in use for more than 30 years. The ABPM technique is used to measure blood pressure every 15 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes during the night while subjects are conducting their daily activities 27. One of the advantages of ABPM is blood pressure measurement at night, which can detect the night blood pressure pattern during sleep. Low estimated glomerular filtration rate is reported in masked, true sustained, night-time hypertension, and normal blood pressure non-dipping patterns at night 21. It has been noted that abnormal ABPM pattern is typically related to proteinuria than to deterioration of estimated glomerular filtration rate in chronic kidney disease patients 56. Also, it has been reported that arterial stiffness is increased in uncontrolled masked blood pressure variant, leading to continuous progressive estimated glomerular filtration rate reduction and blood pressure increase 57. It was claimed that frequent abnormal ABPM records are linked to vascular endothelium dysfunction, increased sympathetic tone, Sodium retention, and induced inflammatory reactions 58. The recommended blood pressure records in both office and ABPM methods to diagnose hypertension are presented in Table 2. Place of blood pressure measurement Systolic/diastolic blood pressure records (mmHg) Hypertension office-based blood pressure record ≥140/≥90 Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring average record Hypertension average 24-hour record ≥130/≥80 Hypertension awake time (daytime) ≥135/≥85 Hypertension night-time (sleeping) ≥120/≥70 TABLE 2: Hypertensive record limits in office and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) blood pressure: Blood Hypertension C. Central blood pressure Monitoring Method Central blood pressure monitoring is an invasive blood pressure recording technique. This technique is performed by inserting an arterial catheter with tonometry at the carotid artery 59.",
    "This technique is performed by inserting an arterial catheter with tonometry at the carotid artery 59. Although the internal Kidney Hypertension is correspondent to the central than peripheral blood pressure, the relationship between the central blood pressure and Kidney function assessed by Urine Protein and estimated glomerular filtration rate is not well investigated. Hence, further studies are required to assess the relationship between central blood pressure and the degree of estimated glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, and chronic kidney disease progression. D. Smartphone and Other Device-Based blood pressure Monitoring Method The smartphone-based method of blood pressure recording is a recently invented way to measure blood pressure via smartphone applications 60, 61. This method has been reported to be inaccurate in blood pressure measurement. Even though phone-, watch-, or scale-based devices can record the peripheral blood pressure, they are not currently able to read the brachial blood pressure. There is not enough data supporting their usage in continuous blood pressure monitoring as ABPM except for one reported study involving an iPhone-based application. To the best of our knowledge, their accuracy and blood pressure records have not been assessed in chronic kidney disease patients. Recently, Degott et al. , based on their analysis of 353 paired recordings from 91 persons, have reported that the smartphone embedded OptiBP cuffless mobile application achieves the validation requirements of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), the European Society of Hypertension (ESH), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), universal standards in a general population for the measurement of diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure 62. Another study conducted by Chandrasekhar et al. concluded that the oscillometric finger-pressing method for measuring blood pressure on a smartphone demonstrated bias and precision errors in systolic and diastolic blood pressure records. These inaccuracies were equivalent to those observed when using the finger-cuff device. The same study noted that cuff-less and calibration-free systolic and diastolic blood pressure monitoring can be possible with a smartphone-based method 63. Recommendations based on current guidelines In November 2015, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) accepted the clinic offices repeated blood pressure recording method to diagnose hypertension and advised that blood pressure be recorded outside of the clinic office to confirm 2022 Habas et al. Cureus 14(4): e24244. DOI 10. 7759/cureus. 24244 5 of 9 hypertension before treatment and follow-up 53. The USPSTF advice was based on the fact that 25% of people who had High blood pressure in the clinic office setting had reportedly turned normotensive when measured by the ABPM method and would not require treatment. The Eighth Joint National Committee and the European Society of hypertension (ESH) advised that office blood pressure is the gold standard for hypertension diagnosis and treatment 61. On the other hand, ESH 2013, ACC/AHA 2017, and ISH 2020 guidelines have advised using intermittent home or ABPM methods if the white-coat and masked hypertension are suspected 27. None of the published guidelines have reported that the central blood pressure recoding technique can be used for routine hypertension diagnosis or treatment followup 58. The recommended blood pressure recording methods by the existing guidelines are summarized in Table 3.",
    "The recommended blood pressure recording methods by the existing guidelines are summarized in Table 3. Guidelines Recommended blood pressure recording methods Intermittent home or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring if the white-coat and masked European Society of Hypertension (ESH), 2013 hypertension are suspected 8th Joint National Committee (JNC), 2014 Office blood pressure recording U. S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), 2015 Repeated office blood pressure measurements with blood pressure recorded outside the clinic office American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association Intermittent home or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring if the white-coat and masked (AHA), 2017 hypertension are suspected Intermittent home or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring if the white-coat and masked International Society of Hypertension (ISH), 2020 hypertension are suspected TABLE 3: Recommended blood pressure recording methods as per the existing guidelines blood pressure: Blood Hypertension Automatic blood pressure measuring devices with multiple records in the physician clinic are better at overcoming white-coat hypertension overdiagnosis compared to the usual clinic office blood pressure recording method 64. Numerous automatic office-based blood pressure records significantly correspond to the average blood pressure records during the daytime 65, although it is not always consistent 66. Although 2017 ACC/AHA recommendations did not specifically advocate that automatic office blood pressure recordings are superior to ABPM, they noted that there is growing evidence supporting the use of automated office blood pressure 67. ISH 2020 guideline recommendation has not stated that ABPM is superior to the office automatic blood pressure measurement method 27. blood pressure measurement by ABPM or home blood pressure recording is highly recommended to diagnose and manage hypertension in the newly published guidelines 11, 15, 17. ABPM allows daytime, night-time, and 24-hour blood pressure determination and diurnal blood pressure variation recording. ABPM reading is strongly linked with target organ damage and cardiovascular disease events than office or clinic blood pressure readings 68, although these conclusions were drawn from studies with several limitations 69. Gender and chronic kidney disease progression Several guidelines have suggested that early hypertension detection and prompt treatment can delay the chronic kidney disease progression and decrease complications in both genders 61, 70. However, the degree to which females and males with hypertension are at equal risk to develop chronic kidney disease outcomes was not thoroughly examined. Murphy et al. have predicted that the prevalence of chronic kidney disease is more common in females 71, although Albertus et al. have noted that end-stage renal disease risk is higher in the male gender 72. A meta-analysis review of the gender-specific effect of chronic kidney disease progression on non-diabetic chronic kidney disease patients proposed that females progress at a slower rate toward end-stage renal disease than males, regardless of the underlying cause 73. On the contrary, another patient-level metaanalysis study that used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to control the blood pressure concluded that renal disease progression rate is possibly quicker among females than males 74. Recently, a study reported an unequal influence of hypertension on chronic kidney disease progression in females versus males, and the discrepancy is questionable to be related to biological differences alone 75. Conclusions blood pressure measurement is essential for diagnosis and following up on the response to therapy. Accurate diagnosis and detection of the hypertension phenotype are critical to preventing chronic kidney disease complications development and progression. Despite the diversity of methods and devices for blood pressure measurement, the mercury sphygmomanometer is still considered the gold standard. However, new devices are increasingly being used currently, but they are not highly accurate and need frequent calibrations."
