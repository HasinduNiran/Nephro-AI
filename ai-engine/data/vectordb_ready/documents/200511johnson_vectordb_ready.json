    "Renal disease THEME Chronic kidney disease Management update C hronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) is defined as a glomerular BACKGROUND Chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease), defined as a glomerular filtration rate less than filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate) less than 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 and/or 60 milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2 and/or evidence of kidney evidence of kidney damage for a period of at least 3 damage for a period of at least 3 months, is months (Table 1). Glomerular filtration rate can either be an increasingly common, serious and undermeasured directly (eg. by clearance of creatinine, iohexol, recognised condition. A recent population study European Dialysis and Transplant Association, diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid scan or iothalamate) or estimated by a validated David W Johnson demonstrated that one in every 6 Australian prediction formula (eg.

Chronic kidney disease is classified into five risk factors, identifying and treating common stages according to the glomerular filtration rate level (Table 2).

Moreover, approximately 6 million individuals have at least one of the major risk factors for chronic kidney disease (Table 3). Chronic kidney disease is often not associated with significant symptoms and is unrecognised in 8090% of cases. 24 The role of the GP With over 1. 7 million adults with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (glomerular filtration rate 3060 milliliters per minute) and only 180 nephrologists in Australia, it is clear that the majority of chronic kidney disease patients (stages 1, 2 and 3) will be managed primarily by Reprinted from Australian Family Physician Vol. 34, No. 11, November 2005 4 915 Theme: Chronic kidney disease management update general practitioners (Table 4).

The steps outlined below will slow macroalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion rate 300 magnesium/day) the decline, but regular monitoring (at least every 3 persistent haematuria (where other causes such as urologic conditions have been excluded) months) is essential. pathologic abnormalities (eg. abnormal renal biopsy) Blood pressure reduction radiologic abnormalities (eg. scarring or polycystic kidneys on renal ultrasound scan) The most important goal in patients with chronic kidney disease is to reduce arterial blood pressure to target levels Methods for measuring or calculating GFR1 (130/85 mmHg if proteinuria 1 g/day or 125/75 mmHg if proteinuria 1 g/day or diabetic). 12 In order to Table 2. Stages of chronic kidney disease (based on the CARI guidelines12) reach currently recommended blood pressure targets, multiple (often 34) antihypertensive medications are frequently required. 11 Meta-regression analyses1316 Stage Description glomerular filtration rate Prevalence Numbers in (milliliters per minute/1. 73 m2) from AusDiab2 Australia have indicated that blood pressure reduction 1 Kidney damagea with ≥90 3. 1% 400 000 accounts for 50% of the variance in glomerular filtration rate decline normal or and that each 10 mmHg reduction in mean arterial pressure (down to 92 mmHg) confers a benefit in glomerular filtration rate preservation of 3. 75. 0 milliliters per minute/year. Based on the weight of accumulated evidence to date, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors remain the first line therapy for patients with chronic kidney disease, 17 although recent new evidence in type 2 diabetic nephropathy suggests that angiotensin receptor blockers (angiotensin receptor blocker) may provide comparable renoprotection. 1820 Antiproteinuric agents The benefits of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocker seem to be disproportionate to the degree of blood pressure reduction16, 18, 2123 and proportional to the degree of baseline proteinuria2426 and its reduction following treatment. 18, 24 Several studies have found that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocker are more effective than other specific antihypertensive agents, including diuretics, ß-blockers and calcium channel blockers, in reducing protein excretion and in slowing the decline of kidney 916 3Reprinted from Australian Family Physician Vol. 34, No. 11, November 2005 glomerular filtration rate 2 Kidney dama gea with 6089 4% 500 000 mild glomerular filtration rate 3 Moderate glomerular filtration rate 3059 10. 9% 1 400 000 4 Severe glomerular filtration rate 1529 0. 3% 40 000 5 Kidney failure 15 or on dialysis 0.",
