    "GENERAL PATHOLOGY OF THE Kidney A/Professor John Finnie University Veterinarian, Office of the Deputy ViceChancellor (Research) University of Adelaide The kidneys: A pair of handy tea strainers The following extract from the ABCs Body Programme, written by Dr Earle Hackett, a former haematologist at the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science in Adelaide, neatly outlines the principal functions of the Kidney and why it is vulnerable to damage Renal characteristics It is at the butchers that most people get a butchers at a pair of kidneys. There is one very noticeable thing about them. The arteries and veins entering and leaving appear to be very large . . almost a quarter of the circulating Blood goes through the kidneys each time around Everyone knows from experience that if you Drink liquid, however turbid or flavoured or mixed, before long some clear straw-coloured pee will flush out at your other end. Some kind of filtering is going on. The connecting channel is the bloodstream. Water is absorbed into the Blood from the gut and removed from the bloodstream by the Kidney. So what the Kidney is filtering is not tea, or beer, but Blood. Urine is a concentrated filtrate of the Blood Renal characteristics The main artery that enters each Kidney promptly branches and re-branches until it has finally divided into about a million small Blood vessels, tangled like a ball of thread, termed a glomerulus (from glomus, a Roman ladys ball of thread) Each glomerulus hangs like a nipple into a small cellular receiving funnel that is closed around it like a babys lips. Each of these funnels has a draining outlet that connects up with its million fellows through collecting tubules to form the ureter that carries pee to the bladder Renal characteristics The fine walls of the very small Blood vessels that form the glomerulus are leaky. They leak like sieves. They have sieve holes that only hold back large molecules in the Blood like plasma proteins, but let everything else through. There are also a few smaller Protein molecules that the sieve would not retain were it not for electrostatic attractions But everything else pours out from the Blood through the little sieve holes into the collecting funnels Water (gallons of it), salt, Glucose, amino acids, bicarbonate, Potassium, calcium, phosphates, and urea everything small and soluble. The only things that are held back are those that are differentially kept in the Blood by being specifically carried on large, special Blood plasma molecules into which they are temporally slotted. If this was all, the kidneys would be no more than Blood strainers Renal characteristics But you need most of the Water and the sugars and salt and so on that is being filtered out at an enormous rate. The Blood vessel still continues in the Kidney after it leaves the glomerulus It continues beside the cell walls of the urinary tubule in which the watery filtrate is now flowing. The Blood Hypertension in that Blood vessel is now slacker.",
    "The Blood Hypertension in that Blood vessel is now slacker. The effect is that much of the Water and Glucose and salt in the filtrate moves back by osmosis across the tube wall into the Blood again The rest of the urinary collecting tubes are quite lengthy, are lined by active cells that use energy to return to the Blood the rest of the Glucose, salts and amino acids and so on that the body does not want to lose So by this combined mechanism of heavy filtration followed by first passive and then specific chemical reabsorption, the Kidney eventually allows a concentrate of about 2 litres to run out as pee every 24 hours. Therefore, out of all that filtering of 200 litres from the Blood, 198 litres has been absorbed back into the Blood again Renal characteristics The Kidney is cleansing the soluble components of the house of the body by constantly flinging everything out, then reorganising and bringing back in again only the familiar and the useful, and leaving the rest to leak away as unwanted sewerage However, where the kidneys are vulnerable is where they are exceptional; which is where they handle so much Blood and where they concentrate things. For example, some mildly harmful component that is in the circulation and damages small Blood vessels could have heavy local effects in the Kidney. So also might a small amount of a cell poison that could have become extra active when concentrated in the Kidney tubules Renal functions Central organ involved in maintenance of a constant extracellular environment in the body Vital homeostatic functions are: Excretion of waste products Maintenance of normal concentrations of salt and Water in the body Regulation of acid-base balance Production of hormones (erythropoietin, renin, prostaglandins) Metabolism of vitamin D to its active form Essential requirements for normal renal function Adequate perfusion with Blood (Hypertension 60mmHg) renal Blood flow is High (up to 25% of cardiac output) and decreased Blood flow causes injury, especially to the cortex. It is only reduced to preserve circulation to Heart and brain Adequate functional renal tissue Normal elimination of Urine Renal functions Water and salt are the most important constituents of body fluids and need to be conserved Large quantities of metabolites also need to be excreted (nitrogenous wastes and a multitude of other organic and inorganic substances) Excretion of wastes and conservation of Water requires a concentrating mechanism capable of raising the osmotic Hypertension of Urine above that of Blood Renal Blood flow remains constant to ensure a stable glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate) Renal functions The glomerulus produces an ultrafiltrate due to High capillary hydrostatic Hypertension and Low hydrostatic Hypertension in Bowmans space and difference in osmotic Hypertension.",
    "The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is semipermeable Injury to the glomerulus can result from inadequate glomerular Blood flow and/or structural changes that alter its permeability After crossing the GBM, the ultrafiltrate enters the tubular lumen and many filtered substances are then retrieved by selective reabsoption Main function of the Kidney is regulation of salt and Water balance, achieved by antidiuretic hormone (ADH) (also termed vasopressin) and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system Renal pathology In progressive renal disease, remaining nephrons hypertrophy as new nephrons cannot be formed in a mature Kidney and glomerular filtration and tubular function increase to maintain homeostasis All of the renal components are interdependent and, if one component is irreversibly damage, the function of other components will be impaired There is a tendency for chronic renal disease to affect multiple Kidney components, resulting in chronic renal failure and shrunken, scarred, end-stage kidneys (at which time, it can be impossible to determine the initiating cause) Renal anatomy Kidneys in domestic animals are classified as unipyramidal or unilobar (cats, dogs, small ruminants and horses) or multipyramidal or multilobar (pigs, cattle) On section, subdivisions of cortex and medulla are discernible The functional unit of the Kidney is the nephron, which consists of the renal corpuscle (glomerulus and Bowmans capsule), proximal and distal convolute tubules and the loop of Henle 4 main components of Kidney: glomeruli, tubules, interstitium and Blood vessels MULTIPYRAMIDAL BOVINE Kidney Renal vascular supply Renal artery divides to form interlobular arteries, which then branch as arcuate arteries, then becoming interlobular arteries which in turn form prearterioles Prearterioles give rise to glomerular afferent arterioles, then glomerular capillary loops, which fuse to form efferent arterioles, then the peritubular capillary plexus The glomerular capillary tufts are perfused at High Hypertension for filtration and the capillary bed arising from efferent arterioles is Low Hypertension for reabsorption Renal vascular supply Renal arteries are end-arteries and occlusion leads to infarction Medulla is very sensitive to ischaemia because of its relative avascularity Glomerular filtration Glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate) is controlled by tubuloglomerular feedback Low glomerular filtration rate causes decreased NaCl delivery to distal tubules, which is detected by the macular densa in these tubules, leading to contraction of efferent arteriole and dilation of afferent arteriole, increasing the glomerular filtration rate. A High glomerular filtration rate initiates the opposite response Macula densa secretes prostaglandin E2, causing renin release from afferent arteriole juxtaglomerular cells, which acts on angiotensinogen (produced by Liver) to generate angiotensin I which, in turn, is cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor Angiotensin II also initiates (1) adrenocortical release of aldosterone, which increases resorption of sodium from distal tubules and collecting ducts, resulting in Water retention and (2) secretion of ADH by the posterior pituitary, which increases Water resorption (via aquaporin channels) in collecting ducts Glomerulus Vascular and epithelial structure designed for the ultrafiltration of plasma Visceral epithelium (podocytes) covers the abluminal surface of glomerular capillaries, while parietal epithelium lines basement membrane of Bowmans capsule Arterioles enter and leave the glomerulus at vascular pole and Urine enters proximal convoluted tubule at urinary pole Glomerular filtration membrane consists of 3 layers Fenestrated capillary endothelium Glomerular basement membrane (GBM), a complex, porous meshwork and sizeand charge-dependent barrier, produced by podocytes and endothelium Podocytes, which have complex interdigitating trabeculae whose foot processes (pedicels) are embedded in GBM.",
    "Pedicels are separated by filtration slits, which are bridged by diaphragms with pores Glomerular basement membrane GBM is highly permeable to Water and small solutes, but excludes High MW plasma proteins Changes in GBM porosity and charge alter glomerular permeability and can lead to proteinuria, a hallmark of glomerular damage The Irish surgeon and poet, Oliver St John Gogarty knew the importance of proteinuria in renal disease, as can be seen in the last 3 verses of his poem entitled: John Kidney who died of Acute Nephritis For the walls of the And, though by the And there came flesh which immure in doctors unbidden, he on the Dies The spirit, as tubes do Passed out through Suprema their lumen, these clouds to his That comes to all Came Urine, and, goal: who draw breath mixed with the Urine, Albumen and coma Death, ushered in Were clouds of and Kidney by oedema, albumen. Secreted his soul. Oedema and Death. Mesangium Occupies the central region of glomerulus and composed of basement membrane-like glycoprotein and phagocytic, contractile cells derived from vascular smooth muscle cells Functions in phagocytic removal of macromolecules, removal of GBM, and may modulate intraglomerular Blood flow Also produces a variety of cytokines Mesanglial cell hyperplasia and increased mesangial matrix are common lesions in glomerular disease Renal tubules These structures are correlated with function Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) has a well-developed brush border and numerous mitochondria and, since energy for resorption is produced by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, it is especially vulnerable to hypoxia Many toxins are resorbed/secreted by PCT, potentially causing chemical injury 60-80% of the glomerular ultrafiltrate is resorbed by PCT and the closely-associated peritubular capillaries permit rapid absorption of sodium and chloride, which Water follows (also resorbs glucose, amino acids, calcium, potassium, uric acid, proteins and phosphate many of these are resorbed until a threshold is reached and, when this is exceeded, the substance appears in Urine) Renal tubules Long loops of Henle penetrate deep into medulla and their Urine concentrating ability is directly related to their length. NaCl is actively pumped from ascending limb (which is impermeable to Water), draining Water from descending limb and returning it to the cortex If Water preservation is required, ADH release increases the permeability of medullary collecting ducts (CD) to urea and Water.",
    "When there is proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia, generalised oedema and hyperlipidaemia, the term nephrotic syndrome is applied Proteinuria leading to the formation of many Protein casts in tubular lumina Glomerular disease Can be: Diffuse (involves 50% of glomeruli) Focal (involves 50% of glomeruli) Global (involves the entire glomerular tuft) Segmental (involves only part of a glomerulus) Mesangial (affects primarily the mesangial region) Classification of glomerular disease Glomerular disease can be further classified as: Membranous GBM remodelling secondary to immune complex deposition with normal to mild hypercellularity Proliferative increased cellularity without significant alterations to GBM Classification of glomerular disease (cont) Mesangioproliferative increased cellularity limited to mesangium with evidence of immune complex deposition in this region Mesangiocapillary proliferation capillary and mesangial proliferation with remodelling of capillary loop from immune complex deposition between endothelium and GBM Segmental glomerulosclerosis segmental effacement of capillary loops by ECM Global glomerulosclerosis tuft is shrunken, eosinophilic and hypocellular Histological changes in glomerular disease Cellularity of glomerular tuft may be increased by proliferation of endothelial, epithelial or mesangial cells inflammatory cell infiltration Mesangial cells may also migrate out into capillary loop (mesangial cell interpositioning) Fibrin exudation and rupture of GBM results in proliferation of visceral and parietal epithelium infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils and interstitial fibroblasts, forming glomerular crescents Histological changes in glomerular disease Edema of foot processes with subsequent retraction reversible and associated with Protein leakage Thickening and remodelling of GBM due to immune complex deposition Chronic diffuse immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. Cortical surface is finely granular. Chronic glomerulonephritis thickening of glomerular and capsular basement membranes (PAS stain) Glomerulonephritis left panels show glomerular basement membrane thickening (PAS stain) and right panels show the pattern of immunofluorescence staining for IgG deposition Fibrinous glomerulonephritis fibrin deposition and leucocytic infiltration Chronic glomerulonephritis thickening of glomerular and capsular basement membranes and hyperplasia of parietal epithelium. Interstitial lymphocytic infiltration.",
    "Interstitial lymphocytic infiltration. Protein cast Chronic glomerulonephritis abundant periglomerular fibrosis and hypercellularity of glomerular tuft Chronic glomerulonephritis end-stage glomerulus with marked basement membrane thickening and hyalinisation Pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis May result from: Deposition of circulating, non-glomerular origin, antigen-antibody immune complexes in various glomerular sites (subendothelial, intramembranous, subepithelial, mesangial) Formation in situ of antibodies against intrinsic GBM antigens Activation of the alternative pathway of complement Idiopathic Pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis Once immune complexes have formed, complement fixation occurs with resultant chemotaxis of neutrophils, which ingest complexes, but also release lysosomal enzymes, cytokines and free radicals that cause GBM damage Complement fragments cause histamine release from mast cells, which increases capillary permeability and allows deposition of more immune complexes Pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis Many glomerular, tubular and interstitial elements also release chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) that attract leucocytes Monocytes can remove immune complexes, but also cause enzymatic damage and mesangial cells can produce inflammatory mediators Morphology of glomerulonephritis In the acute phase, there is hypercellularity, mostly due to inflammatory cell infiltration, but also endothelial and mesangial proliferation In subacute phase, often mesangial hypercellularity and/or remodelling of GBM Morphology of glomerulonephritis In chronic phase, scarring of glomeruli occurs, the interstitial reaction initiated in acute phase progresses with fibrosis and lymphocytic infiltration, tubules atrophy and are replaced by scar tissue, and fibrosis becomes self-perpetuating Remaining tubules connected to functioning glomeruli show epithelial hypertrophy/hyperplasia Once glomerular filtration rate has decreased to 30-50% of normal, progression to end-stage renal failure tends to become unavoidable Diseases of renal tubules Primarily reflected in morphological changes in epithelial cells, but tubules and interstitium are intimately associated and damage to one affects the other Diseases involving both simultaneously tubulointerstitial diseases Regeneration of tubular epithelium can occur Histopathology of tubular damage Acute cellular Edema results from damage to mitochondria with clear spaces/vacuoles in epithelial cytoplasm (potentially reversible) Necrotic tubular epithelial cells are hypereosinophilic, have pyknotic nuclei and slough into the lumen, where they form cellular casts Tubules filled with proteinaceous fluid usually indicates increased glomerular permeability and hyaline droplets form in PCT cytoplasm (lysosomes swollen by resorbed Protein). Tamm-Horsfall mucoprotein is produced in ascending loop of Henle and distal tubules Thickening of tubular basement membrane occurs in chronic disease and, in renal amyloidosis, amyloid deposition occurs in tubular basement membrane as well as glomeruli Degeneration and desquamation of tubule lining epithelium Leucocytic cast (neutrophilic) Acute tubular necrosis Amyloid Renal amyloidosis amyloid deposition in glomeruli (Congo red stain) Acute tubular injury Acute tubular injury is an important cause of acute renal failure, produces oliguria/anuria, and can cause death in days, chiefly caused by ischaemia and nephrotoxins Haemoglobin from massive haemolysis and myoglobin from severe skeletal muscle breakdown are also primary nephrotoxins Haemoglobinuric nephrosis Haemoglobinuric nephrosis numerous haemoglobin casts in tubular lumina Tubulointerstitial disease Involve both interstitium and tubules and acknowledges that these inflammatory and degenerative diseases almost always impair tubular function Caused by a vast array of agents, including infections, toxins, immunological disorders, chemicals and therapeutic drugs Tubulointerstitial disease Clinically, usually results in impaired Urine concentrating ability or specific tubular defects of resorption or secretion Histologically, interstitial inflammation and fibrosis and tubular dilatation and atrophy (versus persistent proteinuria with glomerular disease) Non-suppurative interstitial nephritis focal lymphohistiocytic inflammation with slight scarring is common in domestic animals (e. g. leptospirosis) Suppurative interstitial nephritis with bacterial infection, either haematogenous (embolic suppurative nephritis) or ascending from the lower urinary tract (pyelonephritis with inflammation of pelvis and renal parenchyma) Suppurative nephritis numerous pale nodules Multifocal embolic bacterial nephritis scattered pale cortical foci"
