However, theassociationbetweendaytimeandnight-timeintrarenalRASactivationandrenalstructuraldamagein normotensive IgA nephropathy patients is unclear. We investigated the relationships between urinary angiotensinogen (UAGT) excretion, which reflects intrarenal renal artery stenosis activity, and renal structural damage (i. e. , endocapillary and mesangial cell hypercellularity, arteriolarhyalinosisandarteriosclerosislevels, andglobalglomerulosclerosisandtubulointerstitialfibrosis percentages) in 27 normotensive IgA nephropathy patients (age 39. 2±13. 6 years, 10 men and 17 women, estimated glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate) 74. 0±17. 3ml/min/1. 73m2, urinary Protein excretion 0. 58±0. 50g/day, and U-AGT excretion 64. 9±100. 6μg/day). The arteriosclerosis level had a significant positive association with the daytime and nighttime U-AGT excretion levels. By contrast, the endocapillary and mesangial cell hypercellularity and arteriolar hyalinosis levelsandglobalglomerulosclerosisandtubulointerstitialfibrosispercentagesdidnotcorrelatewiththedaytimeandnighttime U-AGT excretion levels. The daytime and night-time U-AGT excretion levels were higher in patients with arteriosclerotic changes than in patients without these changes. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the arteriosclerosislevelshadasignificantpositiveassociationwiththeU-AGTexcretionlevelsatnightafteradjustingforage, sex, body mass index, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate. However, when diastolic blood pressure was added as an independent variable, the relationship between U-AGT excretion and arteriosclerosis at night disappeared. In normotensive IgA nephropathy patients, intrarenal renal artery stenosis activation at night due to nocturnal hypertension may be associated with arteriosclerosis.

These previous data and our data from for gene expression, and activation of complement, the this study suggest that the intrarenal renal artery stenosis activation levels inflammasome and autophagy are induced in tubular cells, vary in accordance with each Kidney disease and that the causing fibroblast proliferation and accumulation of extradifferences in intrarenal renal artery stenosis activation influence the cellular matrix in tubulointerstitial lesions. Finally, tubular arteriosclerosis levels. In the future, we intend to examine atrophy and interstitial fibrosis are induced 34. In this this association between intrarenal renal artery stenosis activation and the study, the amount of urinary Protein was small, and the arteriosclerosis levels for each Kidney disease. renal function was almost within normal limits. Hence, Activation of intrarenal renal artery stenosis plays a critical role in the intrarenal renal artery stenosis activation is probably correlated with the pathophysiology of renal damage in some animal models arteriosclerosis levels but not with the global glomeruloand patients 311.
