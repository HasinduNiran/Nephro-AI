Analyses were conducted with Cox regression models, adjusted for clinic and 24-hour ambulatory Blood pressures and for confounders. RESULTS During a median follow-up of 4. 7 years, 3808 patients died from any cause, and 1295 of these patients died from cardiovascular causes. In a model that included both 24hour and clinic measurements, 24-hour systolic Hypertension was more strongly associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1. 58 per 1-SD increase in Hypertension; 95% confidence interval CI, 1. 56 to 1. 60, after adjustment for clinic Blood Hypertension) than the clinic systolic Hypertension (hazard ratio, 1. 02; 95% CI, 1. 00 to 1. 04, after adjustment for 24-hour Blood Hypertension). Corresponding hazard ratios per 1-SD increase in Hypertension were 1. 55 (95% CI, 1. 53 to 1. 57, after adjustment for clinic and daytime Blood pressures) for nighttime ambulatory systolic Hypertension and 1. 54 (95% CI, 1. 52 to 1. 56, after adjustment for clinic and nighttime Blood pressures) for daytime ambulatory systolic pressure. These relationships were consistent across subgroups of age, sex, and status with respect to obesity, Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and antihypertensive treatment. Masked hypertension was more strongly associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 2. 83; 95% CI, 2. 12 to 3. 79) than sustained hypertension (hazard ratio, 1. 80; 95% CI, 1. 41 to 2. 31) or white-coat hypertension (hazard ratio, 1. 79; 95% CI, 1. 38 to 2. 32). Results for cardiovascular mortality were similar to those for all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS Ambulatory Blood-Hypertension measurements were a stronger predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality than clinic Blood-Hypertension measurements. White-coat hypertension was not benign, and masked hypertension was associated with a greater risk of death than sustained hypertension.

Participants were considered to have Diabetes mellitus if they had a plasma fasting glucose level of 7 mmol or more per liter (130 magnesium per deciliter) or received antidiabetic drugs. Dyslipidemia was defined as a total cholesterol level greater than 4. 9 mmol per liter (190 magnesium per deciliter), Lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol level greater than 3 mmol per liter (120 magnesium per deciliter), or Highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol level less than 1. 0 mmol per liter (40 magnesium per deciliter) in men or less than 1. 2 mmol per liter (46 magnesium per deciliter) in women; fasting triglycerides level greater than 1. 7 mmol per liter (150 magnesium per deciliter); or the use of lipidlowering drugs. The specific cardiovascular diseases that were considered were ischemic Heart disease, stroke, and Heart failure, as documented in the clinical record. Hypertension phenotypes were defined in untreated patients as follows: normotension was normal clinic Blood Hypertension (systolic 140 mm Hg and diastolic 90 mm Hg) and normal 24hour Hypertension (systolic 130 mm Hg and diastolic 80 mm Hg); whitecoat hypertension was defined as elevated clinic Blood Hypertension (systolic ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic ≥90 mm Hg) and normal 24hour Hypertension; masked hypertension was de fined as normal clinic Blood Hypertension and elevated 24hour Hypertension (systolic ≥130 mm Hg or diastolic ≥80 mm Hg); and sustained hyperten sion was defined as elevated clinic and 24hour Blood pressures. In treated patients, the corresponding terms were controlled hypertension, whitecoat uncontrolled hypertension, masked uncontrolled hypertension, and sustained uncontrolled hypertension, respectively, and were defined with the same BloodHypertension cutoff points as those used for untreated patients. 1512 n engl j med 378; 16 nejm.",

First, clinic sociation of 24-hour systolic Blood Hypertension with Blood Hypertension represented the average of only all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was simitwo readings at each clinic visit; thus, the mean lar to that seen for daytime systolic Hypertension and clinic Hypertension could be overestimated because it nighttime systolic Hypertension and remained sigtends to become lower with repeated measurenificant in multivariate adjustment that included ments. Nevertheless, this is a pragmatic study of clinic Blood Hypertension. These findings were conreal-world clinical practice where this approach sistent in subgroups defined according to age, sex, to clinic Blood-Hypertension measurement is more the presence or absence of obesity, and status typical than that adopted in clinical trials. Likewith respect to Diabetes, previous cardiovascular wise, in most patients, ambulatory Blood-presdisease, and antihypertensive drug treatment. sure monitoring was performed at a single time In our study, unlike most previous studpoint, thus limiting its prognostic power.

Second, we have no patients with sustained hypertension. In previous data on medication during the follow-up period research, white-coat hypertension showed a risk except in patients who had two ambulatory similar to that of normotension, 14, 16, 18-22 or an Blood-Hypertension monitoring sessions; in these intermediate risk between normotension and patients, the main study associations did not hypertension. 15, 36-39 In our study, white-coat hypervary according to the number of medications tension was not benign, which may be due in received (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appenpart to the higher mean Blood Hypertension over 24 dix).
