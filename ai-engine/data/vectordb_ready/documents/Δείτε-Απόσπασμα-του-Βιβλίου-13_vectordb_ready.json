The afferent arteriole, glomerular capillary, efferent arteriole, Bowmans Space and junction with proximal tubule are shown in the insert; podocytes (visceral epithelium) are shown as an outer cover of the glomerular vessel. About 30% of the plasma volume coming in from the afferent delivery is filtered across the glomerulus into Bowmans space. Approximately 24 milliliters per minute/kg of fluid traverses the glomerulus into Bowmans space in normal dogs and cats, and this volume is referred to as the glomerular estimated glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate). glomerular filtration rate is largely a function of the algebraic sum of Starlings forces that include glomerular capillary Hypertension, oncotic Hypertension within the glomerulus, and tubular Hypertension in Bowmans space. Glomerular capillary Hypertension develops as a function of plasma flow into the glomerulus and the resistance to flow of fluid out of the glomerulus. In addition to Starling forces, glomerular filtration rate also depends on the surface area of the glomerular capillaries and their inherent permeability characteristics (Kf). The larger image below shows that only the smaller molecular weight and size molecules are filtered into Bowmans space. Proteins with higher molecular weight and size (shown as larger blue and orange elements within the glomerular capillary) do not cross the glomerulus. This figure also shows that cells (red blood cell shown) stay within the glomerular capillary and do not cross the glomerulus.

The major factors needed to elaborate maximally concentrated Urine are shown in this illustration (excluding the isosmotic reabsorption of solute and Water that transpired along the proximal tubule). A critical minimal number of healthy nephrons are needed to make concentrated Urine, and the body must be capable of synthesizing and releasing ADH in adequate quantity. The integrity of the collecting tubule V-2 receptor to bind to ADH and initiate intracellular signals for the phosphorylation of aquaporin2 is essential. The major stimulus for the release of ADH is an increase in plasma osmolality perfusing the hypothalamus; most domestic animals have evolved to produce concentrated Urine for much of the day. The ability to concentrate or dilute the Urine centers on the ability of the medullary thick ascending limb of the loop of Henles ability to actively reabsorb Sodium and chloride without Water. The ascending limb of the loop of Henle is impermeable to Water so that the osmolality of tubular fluid progressively decreases during ascent of the loop. At the same time, the osmolality of the interstitium increases as solute is added to this region. ADH increases the permeability of the cortical collecting duct to Water but not urea, so the concentration of urea progressively increases as it descends the cortical collecting duct. The increased concentration of urea is represented by the size of the font. The medullary collecting duct is inherently permeable to urea, contributing importantly to the hyperosmolality of this region as urea diffuses into the interstitium. The permeability of the inner medullary collecting duct to urea is enhanced by ADH interaction with specific urea transporters (UT A-1 and UT A3), which are variably located along the apex, within the tubule cell, and along the basolateral membranes 23 that further movement of urea into the interstitium. The thin descending limb of Henles loop has a specific urea transporter (UT A-2 ) that facilitates recycling of urea from the interstitium into the tubular lumen. Step 1: the sodium-potassium - 2Cl cotransporter provides the energy that initially generates interstitial hyperosmolality. This process also generates tubular fluid hypoosmolality since this segment of the nephron is not permeable to Water. Step 2: in the late distal tubule and cortical collecting tubule, ADH increases Water but not urea permeability. Water leaves the tubules from these segments due to the hyperosmolality of the interstitium generated by step 1. Since Water but not urea leaves these segments, note that the tubular fluid concentration of urea increases.",
    "Since Water but not urea leaves these segments, note that the tubular fluid concentration of urea increases. Step 3: as tubular fluid reaches the medullary collecting tubule, the concentration of urea is quite High. The High concentrations of urea at this location favor diffusion in this region that is permeable to urea. Urea transporters here favor diffusion from tubular fluid into the interstitium, increasing the osmolality of this region. Urea contributes substantially to the solute concentration of this region. Urea transporters also favor the uptake of urea from the interstitium into the thin descending limb of Henles loop. Step 4: the High concentration of urea and NaCl in the interstitium favors the movement of Water out of the descending thin limb of Henles loop. The thin descending limb is highly permeable to Water and not so soluble for Sodium and chloride. As a consequence, the concentration of Sodium and chloride progressively increases until the point of the hair pin turn of Henles loop is reached. Step 5: Sodium and chloride are shown leaving the thin ascending limb of Henles loop down their concentration gradient. This occurs because Sodium and chloride are relatively permeable in this region and have achieved a High concentration from processes that happened previously in the descending loop (Step 4). The thin ascending limb is impermeant to Water, which contributes to the progressive development of hypoosmolality as solute, but not Water, is removed from the ascending limb. The Sodium and chloride that leave the ascending thin limb contribute to the interstitial hyperosmolality of that region, which further facilitates Water movement from the collecting tubule in the presence of ADH activity.

The maximal Urine osmolality can approach 2800 mOsm/kg in dogs and 3000 mOsm/kg in cats. Less than 1% of the fluid filtered across the glomerulus is excreted as the final Urine volume under these circumstances. The role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in urinary concentration is not fully understood and most likely depends on which receptor is activated under varying physiologic conditions. PGE2 has been thought to have negative effects on Urine concentration until recently. Water reabsorption and Water excretion by the Kidney can be facilitated by PGE2, and increased prostaglandin effects have been implicated in some polyuric conditions, especially in hypercalcemia. In some studies, polyuria was decreased by administering antiprostaglandin medications 32. Urine Dilution When there is excess Water in the extracellular fluid (ECF), the plasma osmolality decreases. To remove excess Water from the body, the glomerular filtrate needs to be diluted as it passes through the nephron. This is accomplished by the reabsorption of solutes to a greater extent than Water. The tubular fluid remains isosmotic to plasma as it passes through the proximal FIGURE 1. 14 Vasa recta countercurrent exchanger system. convoluted tubule, and fluid is reabsorbed as it passes through The vasa recta consist of postglomerular efferent arterioles from juxthe descending limb of the loop of Henle, becoming more contaglomerular nephrons.

The relationship between glomerular filtration rate and serum Creatinine is described as curvilinear, exponential, or hyperbolic 94, 96. There is an exponential relationship between decreasing glomerular filtration rate and increasing serum Creatinine (Figure 1. 16). Notice that despite a substantial decrease in glomerular filtration rate, there is a minimal increase in serum Creatinine concentration until a pivot point is reached at the exponential rise part of the curve. At that point, each subsequent further decrease in glomerular filtration rate is associated with a much larger increase in serum Creatinine concentration.

In chronic kidney disease, the area up to 50% decrease in glomerular filtration rate is referred to as that of decreased renal reserve, from 50% to 75% 177, 178.
