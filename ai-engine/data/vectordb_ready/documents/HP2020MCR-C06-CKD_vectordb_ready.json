This chapter includes objectives that monitor the incidence, prevalence, and mortality from chronic Kidney disease and end-stage renal disease; cardiovascular care for persons with chronic Kidney disease; and recommended medical evaluation and treatment for patients with chronic Kidney disease. The Readers Guide provides a step-by-step explanation of the content of this chapter, including criteria for highlighting objectives in the Selected Findings. 1 Status of Objectives Figure 61.
