    "Chronic Kidney Disease in the United States, 2023 Accessible Version: kidney disease-national-facts. html When people develop chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease), their kidneys become damaged and over time may not clean the Blood as well as healthy kidneys. If kidneys do not work well, toxic waste and extra fluid accumulate in the body and may lead to Hypertension, Heart disease, stroke, and early death. However, people with chronic kidney disease and people at risk for chronic kidney disease can take steps to protect their kidneys with the help of their health care providers. chronic kidney disease Is Common Among ultrasound Adults chronic kidney disease Risk Factors Fast Stats Diabetes and Hypertension are the more common causes of More than 1 in 7 ultrasound adultsabout chronic kidney disease in most adults. Other risk 35. 5 million people, or 14%are factors include Heart disease, estimated to have chronic kidney disease.

Prescribed Newer Blood GlucoseLowering Medications, by Age, Sex, and Race/Ethnicity Testing and Treatment: Find it Early, Treat it Early Test for chronic kidney disease regularly in people who have Diabetes, Hypertension, or other risk factors for chronic kidney disease. People with chronic kidney disease may not feel ill or notice any symptoms until chronic kidney disease is advanced. The only way to find out if people have chronic kidney disease is through simple Blood and Urine tests. The Blood test checks for the level of Creatinine, a waste product produced by muscles, to see how well the kidneys work. The Urine test checks for Protein, which may indicate Kidney damage.

People With chronic kidney disease Can Lower Kidney Failure Their Risk for Kidney Failure Kidney failure happens when Kidney damage is severe and Kidney function is very Low. Dialysis or a Kidney transplant is then needed for survival. Kidney failure treated with Dialysis or a Kidney transplant is called end-stage Kidney Learn about chronic kidney disease from a primary care doctor or a Kidney doctor disease (end-stage kidney disease). chronic kidney disease is more likely to lead to Kidney failure, especially in older (nephrologist) to better understand treatment options and protect the adults, if the kidneys are damaged due to unmanaged risk factors, repeated kidneys.

However, Monitor and manage Blood Glucose and Blood Hypertension. not everyone with chronic kidney disease develops Kidney failure. If chronic kidney disease is detected early, treatment may slow the decline in Kidney function and delay Kidney failure. ° Have Blood Glucose and Blood Hypertension checked regularly. In some cases, though, Kidney failure develops even with treatment. ° Use medicines if prescribed to lower Blood Glucose and Blood Hypertension. Manage chronic kidney disease: Facts About end-stage kidney disease ° Make lifestyle changes (e. g. , healthy eating, physical activity) to In 2020: prevent more Kidney damage. Meet with a dietitian to create a About 130, 522 people in the United States started treatment for end-stage kidney disease. Kidney-healthy eating plan that is Low in salt and fat and has the Nearly 808, 000 people in the United States, or 2 in every 1, 000 people, right amount and sources of Protein. As chronic kidney disease gets worse, the plan were living with end-stage kidney disease: 69% were on Dialysis and 31% were living with a may also include limiting phosphorus and Potassium. Kidney transplant. ° Use medicines as directed to slow the decline in Kidney function. Incidence rate of end-stage kidney disease among men is 60% higher than among women. ° Stop smoking or do not start smoking.",
