Offer Screening for chronic kidney disease using estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum Creatinine and Urine Albumin: Creatinine Ratio (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio) to people with any of the following risk factors: Markers of Kidney Damage (one or Albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥3 magnesium/mmol) confirmed on an early All people living with Diabetes at least annually. more) morning Urine sample if urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 70mg/mmol.

EPI (not MDRD) 2 Guidelines for management of chronic kidney disease in adults Version 1. 3 Approved: Review Date: November 2027 How do we categorise chronic kidney disease, how often should we test and when should we refer/seek advice? When reviewing results, place the test results in clinical context including consideration of why the Blood tests were taken. If history of acute illness, then assess and manage accordingly. Consider acute Kidney injury (acute kidney injury) and the possibility of obstruction if rapidly declining estimated glomerular filtration rate.

Famotidine is the H2 receptor antagonist of choice in this situation).
