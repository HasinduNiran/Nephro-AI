    "Hypertension and Chronic Kidney Disease Back to Top Blood Hypertension is the Hypertension of Blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Arteries carry Blood from your Heart to other parts of your body. Blood Hypertension normally rises and falls throughout the day, but it can damage your Heart and cause health problems if it stays High for a long time. Hypertension, also called Hypertension, is Blood Hypertension that is higher than normal. Uncontrolled Hypertension is the second leading cause of Kidney failure in the ultrasound. Severe Hypertension can harm Kidney function over a relatively short period of time. Even mild forms of Hypertension can damage kidneys over several years. Blood Hypertension fast facts The top number in a Blood Hypertension measurement is called the systolic Hypertension. This measures the force of Blood against the walls of the arteries when the Heart is pumping. The lower number is called the diastolic Hypertension. This measures the force of the Blood when the Heart is between beats. Both numbers are important and need to be controlled. In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association published new guidelines for hypertension management and defined High hypertension as a Blood Hypertension at or above 130/80 mm Hg. Stage 2 hypertension is defined as a Blood Hypertension at or above 140/90 mm Hg Nearly half of all adults in the ultrasound (108 million or 45% of the population) have Hypertension Only about 1 out of every 4 people with Hypertension (24%) have their condition under control Hypertension causes Kidney damage Hypertension can constrict and narrow the Blood vessels in your kidneys, which reduces Blood flow and stops the kidneys from working well. When this happens, the kidneys are not able to remove all wastes and extra fluid from your body. Extra fluid in the Blood vessels can raise your Blood Hypertension even more, creating a dangerous cycle, and cause more damage leading to Kidney failure. More than 1 in 7 adults in the ultrasound, or about 37 million people, may have chronic Kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) Hypertension is the second leading cause of Kidney failure in the ultrasound after Diabetes Approximately 1 in 5 adults (20%) in the ultrasound with Hypertension may have chronic kidney disease Although Black or African American people make up about 13 percent of the population, they account for 35 percent of the people with Kidney failure in the United States. These numbers are concerning and reflect some of the nonmedical reasons for the increased rates of Hypertension in communities of color, which include where someone lives and works, the foods they Eat, how much exercise they do, and if they are able to get the medical care they need. Hypertension and the early stages of chronic kidney disease usually does not cause any physical symptoms, which is an important reason to have regular Blood Hypertension screenings Following a healthy diet and taking medicine for Hypertension may keep chronic kidney disease from getting worse and may prevent other health problems such as Heart disease For more information, please contact nkfcaresKidney. org Source: CDC, NIDDK"
