Defect in Sodium excretorycapability, whichbecomesmoreevidentasrenal function deteriorates, makes MAP during the night elevated (that is nocturnal hypertension or nondipper), tocompensatefordiminishednatriuresisduringtheday andtoenhancepressurenatriuresisduringnight.

These findings suggest that Blood Hypertension change was transmitted to glomerular capillaries, and elevated glomerular Hypertension contributes, at least in part, to enhancednocturnalproteinuriainglomerulopathy. Inourpreviousstudywithessentialhypertension17, creatinineexcretionratewasdecreasedfromdaytonight, andnight/dayratioofcreatinineexcretionratewascorrelatedwithnight/dayratioofMAP. ItiswellknowninnormalsubjectsthatGFRisreducedduringthenight17, 28, resultinginreductionincreatinineexcretionrate17. In thepresentstudywithglomerulopathy, however, creatinine excretion rate was not different between day and night, and no correlation was found between night/day ratio of Creatinine excretion rate and night/day ratio of MAP. In addition, there was no tendency at all that the night/dayratioofcreatinineexcretionratewaselevated asrenalfunctiondeteriorated. Althoughcreatinineclearance or glomerular filtration was not measured to comparebetweendayandnight, ourresultssuggestthatGFR was not reduced during night even when renal function wasmaintainedrelativelynormalinglomerulopathy. As seeninanearlystageofexperimentalglomerulonephritis2931, probablyglomerularcapillarypressureiselevatedtocompensateforreducedglomerularfiltrationca- pabilityevenwhenGFRremainsrelativelynormal.
